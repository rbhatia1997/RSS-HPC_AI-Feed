<p>And this week <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i>, filmmaker James Matthews shares his short film, <i>Dive</i>, which was created with an Adobe Premiere Pro-powered workflow supercharged by his ASUS ZenBook Pro <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/laptops-desktops/">NVIDIA Studio</a> laptop with a GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card.</p>
<h2><b>Going With the Flow</b></h2>
<p>Matthews’ goal with <i>Dive</i> was to create a visual and auditory representation of what it feels like to get swallowed up in the creative editing process.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69919" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69919" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69919" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-672x250.png" alt="" width="672" height="250" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-672x250.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-400x149.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-768x286.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-842x314.png 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-406x151.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-188x70.png 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69919" class="wp-caption-text">Talk about a dream content creation location.</figcaption></figure>
<p>“When I’m really deep into an edit, I sometimes feel like I’m fully immersed into the film and the editing process itself,” he said. “It’s almost like a flow state, where time stands still and you are one with your own creativity.”</p>
<p>To capture and visualize that feeling, Matthews used the power of his ASUS ZenBook Pro NVIDIA Studio laptop equipped with a GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card.</p>
<p>He started by brainstorming — listening to music and sketching conceptual images with pencil and paper. Then, Matthews added a song to his Adobe Premiere Pro timeline and created a shot list, complete with cuts and descriptions of focal range, speed, camera movement, lighting and other details.</p>
<p>Next, he planned location and shooting times, paying special attention to lighting conditions.</p>
<p>“I always have my Premiere Pro timeline up so I can really see and feel what I need to create from the images I originally drew while building the concept in my head,” Matthews said. “This helps get the pacing of each shot right, by watching it back and possibly adding it into the timeline for a test.”</p>
<p>Then, Matthews started editing the footage in Premiere Pro, aided by his Studio laptop. His dedicated GPU-based NVIDIA video encoder (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-codec-sdk">NVENC</a>) enabled buttery-smooth playback and scrubbing of his high-resolution and multi-stream footage, saving countless hours.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA Studio | RTX Accelerates Adobe Premiere Pro" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/poTeo7Ft3xk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Matthews’ RTX GPU accelerated a variety of <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/ai-video-editing.html">AI-powered Adobe video editing tools</a>, such as Enhance Speech, Scene Edit Detection and Auto Color, which applies color corrections with just a few clicks.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Real-Time Video Editing and Faster Rendering in Adobe Premiere Pro with NVIDIA RTX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnVsfZT1wHU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, Matthews added sound design before exporting the final files twice as fast thanks to NVENC’s dual AV1 encoders.</p>
<p>“The entire edit used GPU acceleration,” he shared. “Effects in Premiere Pro, along with the NVENC video encoders on the GPU, unlocked a seamless workflow and essentially allowed me to get into my flow state faster.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/news/"><i>Into the Omniverse</i></a><i>, a series focused on how artists, developers and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advances in </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>OpenUSD</i></a><i> and </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>NVIDIA Omniverse</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<p>The combination of powerful 3D tools and groundbreaking technologies can transform the way designers bring their visions to life — and Universal Scene Description, or <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">OpenUSD</a>, is helping enable that synergy. It’s the framework on which the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platform that enables the development of OpenUSD-based tools and 3D workflows is based.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhinoceros</a>, commonly known as Rhino, or Rhino 3D, is a powerful computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D modeling software used across industries — from education and jewelry design to architecture and marine modeling. The most recent software release includes support for OpenUSD export, among other updates, establishing it among the many applications embracing the new 3D standard.</p>
<h2><b>Turning Creativity Into CAD Reality</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tanjalanggner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tanja Langgner</a>, 3D artist and illustrator, grew up in Austria and now lives in a converted pigsty in the English countryside. With a background in industrial design, she’s had the opportunity to work with a slew of design agencies across Europe.</p>
<p>For the past decade, she’s undertaken freelance work in production and visualization, helping clients with tasks ranging from concept design and ideation to CAD and 3D modeling. Often doing industrial design work, Langgner relies on Rhino to construct CAD models,  whether for production evaluation or rendering purposes.</p>
<p>When faced with designs requiring intricate surface patterns, “Rhino’s Grasshopper, a parametric modeler, is excellent in creating complex parametric shapes,” she said.</p>
<p>Langgner is no stranger to OpenUSD. She uses it to transfer assets easily from one application to another, allowing her to visualize her work more efficiently. With the new Rhino update, she can now export OpenUSD files from Rhino, further streamlining her design workflow.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/mathew-schwartz-openusd-omniverse/">Mathew Schwartz</a>, an assistant professor in architecture and design at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, also uses Rhino and OpenUSD in his 3D workflows. Schwartz’s research and design lab, <a href="https://www.siborglab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SiBORG</a>, focuses on understanding and improving design workflows, especially with regard to accessibility, human factors and automation.</p>
<p>With OpenUSD, he can combine his research, Python code, 3D environments and renders, with his favorite tools in Omniverse.</p>
<p>Schwartz, along with Langgner, recently joined a community livestream, where he shared more details about his research — including how he&#8217;s made navigation graphs that show how someone can move in a space if they’re using a wheelchair or crutches in real-time. With his industrial design experience, he demonstrated computation using Rhino 3D and the use of generative AI for a seamless design process.</p>
<p>“With OpenUSD and Omniverse, we’ve been able to expand the scope of our research, as we can easily combine data analysis and visualization with the design process,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA, in collaboration with Google, today launched optimizations across all NVIDIA AI platforms for <a href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-open-models/">Gemma</a> — Google’s state-of-the-art new lightweight <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/gemma-2b">2 billion</a>&#8211; and <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/gemma-7b">7 billion</a>-parameter open language models that can be run anywhere, reducing costs and speeding innovative work for domain-specific use cases.</p>
<p>Teams from the companies worked closely together to accelerate the performance of Gemma — built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models — with <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a>, an open-source library for optimizing large language model inference, when running on NVIDIA GPUs in the data center, in the cloud, and locally on workstations with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a> GPUs or PCs with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/">GeForce RTX</a> GPUs.</p>
<p>This allows developers to target the installed base of over 100 million NVIDIA RTX GPUs available in high-performance AI PCs globally.</p>
<p>Developers can also run Gemma on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud, including on Google Cloud’s A3 instances based on the H100 Tensor Core GPU and soon, NVIDIA’s <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-supercharges-hopper-the-worlds-leading-ai-computing-platform">H200 Tensor Core GPUs</a> — featuring 141GB of HBM3e memory at 4.8 terabytes per second — which Google will deploy this year.</p>
<p>Enterprise developers can additionally take advantage of NVIDIA’s rich ecosystem of tools — including <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo">NeMo framework</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM">TensorRT-LLM</a> — to fine-tune Gemma and deploy the optimized model in their production applications.</p>
<p>Learn more about how <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-revs-up-inference-for-google-gemma/">TensorRT-LLM is revving up inference for Gemma</a>, along with additional information for developers. This includes several model checkpoints of Gemma and the FP8-quantized version of the model, all optimized with TensorRT-LLM.</p>
<p>Experience <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/gemma-2b">Gemma 2B</a> and <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/gemma-7b">Gemma 7B</a> directly from your browser on the NVIDIA AI Playground.</p>
<h2><b>Gemma Coming to Chat With RTX</b></h2>
<p>Adding support for Gemma soon is <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/chat-with-rtx-available-now/">Chat with RTX</a>, an NVIDIA tech demo that uses <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a> and TensorRT-LLM software to give users generative AI capabilities on their local, RTX-powered Windows PCs.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Create A Personalized AI Chatbot with Chat With RTX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gdsRJZT3IJw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The Chat with RTX lets users personalize a chatbot with their own data by easily connecting local files on an RTX PC to a large language model.</p>
<p>Since the model runs locally, it provides results fast, and user data stays on the device. Rather than relying on cloud-based LLM services, Chat with RTX lets users process sensitive data on a local PC without the need to share it with a third party or have an internet connection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>It’s been five years since the telecommunications industry first deployed 5G networks to drive new performance levels for customers and unlock new value for telcos.</p>
<p>But that industry milestone has been overshadowed by the emergence of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> and the swift pace at which telcos are embracing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language models</a> as they seek to transform all parts of their business.</p>
<p>A recent survey of more than 400 telecommunications industry professionals from around the world showed that generative AI is the breakout technology of the year and that enthusiasm and adoption for both generative AI, and AI in general, is booming. In addition, the survey showed that, among respondents, AI is improving both revenues and cost savings.</p>
<p>The generative AI insight is the main highlight in the second edition of NVIDIA’s “State of AI in Telecommunications” survey, which included questions covering a range of AI topics, including infrastructure spending, top use cases, biggest challenges and deployment models.</p>
<p>Survey respondents included C-suite leaders, managers, developers and IT architects from mobile telecoms, fixed and cable companies. The survey was conducted over eight weeks between October and December.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/state-of-ai-report-2024-bbm-iat-p@2x.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-69853" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/state-of-ai-report-2024-bbm-iat-p@2x-672x378.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/state-of-ai-report-2024-bbm-iat-p@2x-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/state-of-ai-report-2024-bbm-iat-p@2x-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/state-of-ai-report-2024-bbm-iat-p@2x-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/state-of-ai-report-2024-bbm-iat-p@2x-800x450.jpg 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/state-of-ai-report-2024-bbm-iat-p@2x-382x215.jpg 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/state-of-ai-report-2024-bbm-iat-p@2x-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/state-of-ai-report-2024-bbm-iat-p@2x.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Ramping Up on Generative AI</b></h2>
<p>The survey results show how generative AI went from relative obscurity in 2022 to a key solution within a year. Forty-three percent of respondents reported they were investing in it, showing clear evidence that the telecom industry is enthusiastically embracing the generative AI wave to address a wide variety of business goals.</p>
<p>More broadly, there was a marked increase in interest in adopting AI and growing expectations of success from the technology, especially among industry executives. In the survey, 53% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that adopting AI will be a source of competitive advantage, compared to 39% who reported the same in 2022. For management respondents, the figure was 56%.</p>
<p>The primary reason for this sustained engagement is because many industry stakeholders expect AI to contribute to their company’s success. Overall, 56% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that “AI is important to my company’s future success,” with the figure rising to 61% among decision-making management respondents. The overall figure is a 14-point boost over the 42% result from the 2022 survey.</p>
<h2><b>Customer Experience Remains Key Driver of AI Investment </b></h2>
<p>Telcos are adopting AI and generative AI to address a wide variety of business needs. Overall, 31% of respondents said they invested in at least six AI use cases in 2023, while 40% are planning to scale to six or more use cases in 2024.</p>
<p>But enhancing customer experiences remains the biggest AI opportunity for the telecom industry, with 48% of survey respondents selecting it as their main goal for using the technology. Likewise, some 35% of respondents identified customer experiences as their key AI success story.</p>
<p>For generative AI, 57% are using it to improve customer service and support, 57% to improve employee productivity, 48% for network operations and management, 40% for network planning and design, and 32% for marketing content generation.</p>
<h2><b>Early Phase of AI Investment Cycle</b></h2>
<p>The focus on customer experience is influencing investments. Investing in customer-experience optimization remains the most popular AI use case for 2023 (49% of respondents) and for generative AI investments (57% of respondents).</p>
<p>Telcos are also investing in other AI use cases: security (42%), network predictive maintenance (37%), network planning and operations (34%) and field operations (34%) are notable examples. However, using AI for fraud detection in transactions and payments had the biggest jump in popularity between 2022 and 2023, rising 14 points to 28% of respondents.</p>
<p>Overall, investments in AI are still in an early phase of the investment cycle, although growing strongly. In the survey, 43% of respondents reported an investment of over $1 million in AI in their previous year, 52% reported the same for the current year, and 66% reported their budget for AI infrastructure will increase in the next year.</p>
<p>For those who are already investing in AI, 67% reported that AI adoption has helped them increase revenues, with 19% of respondents noting that this revenue growth is more than 10% in specific business areas. Likewise, 63% reported that AI adoption has helped them reduce costs in specific business areas, with 14% noting that this cost reduction is more than 10%.</p>
<h2><b>Innovation With Partners</b></h2>
<p>While telcos are increasing their investments to improve their internal AI capabilities, partnerships remain critical for the adoption of AI solutions in the industry. This is applicable both for AI models and AI hardware infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the survey, 44% of respondents reported that co-development with partners is their company’s preferred approach to building AI solutions. Some 28% of respondents prefer to use open-source tools, while 25% take an AI-as-a-service approach. For generative AI, 29% of respondents built or customized models with a partner, an understandable conservative approach for the telecom industry with its stringent data protection rules.</p>
<p>For infrastructure, increasingly, many telcos are opting for cloud hosting, although the hybrid model still remains dominant. In the survey, 31% of respondents reported that they run most of their AI workloads in the cloud (44% for hybrid), compared to 21% of respondents in the previous survey (56% for hybrid). This is helping to fuel the growing need for more localized cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>“Understanding how every person has a different upbringing and how the decisions they made took them to different places is absolutely inspiring,” said Toro. “When I discover a story worth telling, I just feel a necessity to tell it — and tell it right.”</p>
<p>It’s those stories that gave rise to <i>Cinematic Portraits</i>, a photo and video collection of people Toro’s befriended, such as Korean painter Kim Nam Soon, age 81, who impressively learned how to paint at 65.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-69821-1" width="1280" height="720" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-esteban-toro-kim-cinematic-1280w.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-esteban-toro-kim-cinematic-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-esteban-toro-kim-cinematic-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toro’s planning process is long and thorough — he can only retell stories by first having a conversation with each subject, making sure that they understand what the project is about and building a relationship with them so they feel comfortable enough to authentically share.</p>
<p>He captures video and photos of his subjects using Hasselblad and Sony camera gear. Then, he uses Adobe apps, accelerated by GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX technology, in post-production.</p>
<p>Toro deployed the Enhance Speech tool to boost the clarity and quality of voice recordings and adjusted enhancement levels with the Mix Amount setting — all powered by AI. The feature is 75% faster on a GeForce RTX 4090 laptop GPU compared with an RTX 3080 Ti.</p>
<p>“Without AI, the footage, filmed in challenging, noisy conditions, would be unusable,” he said.</p>
<p>The Text-Based Editing tool in Premiere Pro allowed Toro to use speech-to-text AI capabilities to automatically create captions, supported in 18 languages, for video footage — speeding the editing process.</p>

<p>Adobe offers a wide variety of time-saving features, such as the AI-powered Auto Reframe tool for automated editing in multiple size formats for social media with <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro-next/organize-media/import-files/use-project-templates.html">project templates</a>. Toro’s <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/">NVIDIA Studio laptop</a> with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4070-family/">GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card</a> accelerates all of these powerful tools.</p>
<p>Final file exports were achieved 4x faster than with a CPU alone thanks to the GPU-accelerated NVIDIA video encoder (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-codec-sdk">NVENC</a>). Toro quickly and easily added finishing touches in Photoshop Lightroom, using the RTX-accelerated, AI-powered Raw Details feature to refine the color detail of his high-resolution RAW images, and the Super Resolution feature to upscale images with higher quality than traditional methods.</p>
<p>“Having a dedicated GPU for video projects when filming high-quality video is almost mandatory,” said Toro. “Using NVIDIA GPUs allows me to render and process my projects faster, so the post-processing tools are serving my creative ideas, and I’m not limited by what the computer can do, but exactly what I want to create.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J8-CgG5ewJQ?si=Ke2AmFde1VPZS2Jf" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><i></i><br />
Eos’s architecture is optimized for AI workloads demanding ultra-low-latency and high-throughput interconnectivity across a large cluster of accelerated computing nodes, making it an ideal solution for enterprises looking to scale their AI capabilities.</p>
<p>Based on NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand with In-Network Computing technology, its network architecture supports data transfer speeds of up to 400Gb/s, facilitating the rapid movement of large datasets essential for training complex AI models.</p>
<p>At the heart of Eos lies the groundbreaking DGX SuperPOD architecture powered by NVIDIA’s DGX H100 systems.</p>
<p>The architecture is built to provide the AI and computing fields with tightly integrated full-stack systems capable of computing at an enormous scale.</p>
<p>As enterprises and developers worldwide seek to harness the power of AI, Eos stands as a pivotal resource, promising to accelerate the journey towards AI-infused applications that fuel every organization.</p>

NVIDIA’s automotive partners are using digitalization to transform every phase of the product lifecycle — evolving primarily physical, manual processes into software-driven, AI-enhanced digital systems.</p>
<p>Watch the video to learn more.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Digitalization: A Game Changer for the Auto Industry" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2J-o0tO7-98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Digitalization: A Game Changer From End to End</b></h2>
<p>Kaivan Karimi, global partner strategy lead at Microsoft, observes that companies are achieving “huge” results from “digitizing the physical entity, running simulations and rendering in 3D, whether it’s factory automation or modernizing the design and development of the car.”</p>
<p>Brian Ullem, vice president of engineering at Capgemini, explains that, with “the 30,000 parts that go into a car, it takes approximately five years to develop a vehicle end to end. Instead of building 50 or 100 cars, we can use digitalization to simulate without having to build prototypes. That saves a lot of time and money in the process.”</p>
<p>Thomas Mueller, chief technology officer of engineering at Wipro, adds that with digitalization, “we are now able to run simulations at a low cost…and improve the user experience.”</p>
<h2><b>Simulation: Critical for Autonomous Driving</b></h2>
<p>“Simulation is crucial to the development of autonomous systems,” says Ziv Binyamini, CEO of Foretellix. “On one hand, you need the real world, but this is highly costly. So you have to complement it with the ability to simulate a virtual world where everything is possible. And then you can, in a very cost-effective way, iterate quickly and ensure the system operates under all of these conditions.”</p>
<p>Simulation “gives our customers the power to validate their ADAS or autonomous systems virtually — with highly accurate sensors in the camera, lidar and radar domains — without having to rely on actual physical drives,” adds Tony Karam, global sales director at Ansys.</p>
<p>Austin Russell, founder and CEO of Luminar, agrees that &#8220;simulation is absolutely critical for autonomous driving. It’s great to see the work that NVIDIA has been doing in that domain, with not just the hardware but also the software.”</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA Omniverse: The Digital-Physical Convergence</b></h2>
<p>“Software is a new component in the value proposition,” notes Walid Negm, chief technology officer of product engineering at Deloitte. The companies that will “survive and thrive are going to have to become much more efficient using the digital-physical convergence. The Omniverse experience is going to be important for the automotive sector.”</p>
<p>Shiv Tasker, global vice president of engineering at Capgemini, adds that the “visualization and production of digital twins relies on an efficient, high-performance infrastructure as well as the platforms that make it easy for customers to adopt the technology.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">Omniverse</a> “will allow your worldwide team to simultaneously collaborate,” says Karimi of Microsoft. “Design engineers, migration engineers, test engineers — everybody collaborates simultaneously. That’s the power of NVIDIA Omniverse.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Thanks to their work driving AI forward, Akshit Arora and Rafael Valle could someday speak to their spouses’ families in their native languages.</p>
<p>Arora and Valle — along with colleagues Sungwon Kim and Rohan Badlani — won the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/limmits24/home">LIMMITS ’24 challenge</a> which asks contestants to recreate in real time a speaker’s voice in English or any of six languages spoken in India with the appropriate accent. Their novel AI model only required a three-second speech sample.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA team advanced the state of the art in an emerging field of personalized voice interfaces for more than a billion native speakers of Bengali, Chhattisgarhi, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi and Telugu.</p>
<h2><b>Making Voice Interfaces Realistic</b></h2>
<p>The technology for personalized text-to-speech translation is a work in progress. Existing services sometimes fail to accurately reflect the accents of the target language or nuances of the speaker’s voice.</p>
<p>The challenge judged entries by listening for the naturalness of models’ resulting speech and its similarity to the original speaker’s voice.</p>
<p>The latest improvements promise personalized, realistic conversations and experiences that break language barriers. Broadcasters, telcos, universities, as well as e-commerce and online gaming services are eager to deploy such technology to create multilingual movies, lectures and virtual agents.</p>
<p>“We demonstrated we can do this at a scale not previously seen,” said Arora, who has two uses close to his heart.</p>
<h2><b>Breaking Down Linguistic Barriers</b></h2>
<p>A senior data scientist who supports one of NVIDIA’s biggest customers, Arora speaks Punjabi, while his wife and her family are native Tamil speakers.</p>
<p>It’s a gulf he’s long wanted to bridge for himself and others. “I had classmates who knew their native languages much better than the Hindi and English used in school, so they struggled to understand class material,” he said.</p>
<p>The gulf crosses continents for Valle, a native of Brazil whose wife and family speak Gujarati, a language popular in west India.</p>
<p>“It’s a problem I face every day,” said Valle, an AI researcher with degrees in computer music and machine listening and improvisation. “We’ve tried many products to help us have clearer conversations.”</p>
<p>Badlani, an AI researcher, said living in seven different Indian states, each with its own popular language, inspired him to work in the field.</p>
<h2><b>A Race to the Finish Line</b></h2>
<p>The initiative started nearly two years ago when Arora and Badlani formed the four-person team to work on the very different version of the challenge that would be held in 2023.</p>
<p>Their efforts generated a working code base for the so-called Indic languages. But getting to the win announced in January required a full-on sprint because the 2024 challenge didn’t get on the team’s radar until 15 days before the deadline.</p>
<p>Luckily, Kim, a deep learning researcher in NVIDIA’s Seoul office, had been working for some time on an AI model well suited to the challenge.</p>
<p>A specialist in text-to-speech voice synthesis, Kim was designing a so-called P-Flow model prior to starting his second internship at NVIDIA in 2023. P-Flow models borrow the technique large language models employ of using short voice samples as prompts so they can respond to new inputs without retraining.</p>
<p>“I created the model for English, but we were able to generalize it for any language,” he said.</p>
<p>“We were talking and texting about this model even before he started at NVIDIA,” said Valle, who mentored Kim in two internships before he joined full time in January.</p>
<h2><b>Giving Others a Voice</b></h2>
<p>P-Flow will soon be part of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/riva/">NVIDIA Riva</a>, a framework for building multilingual speech and translation AI software, included in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform.</p>
<p>The new capability will let users deploy the technology inside their data centers, on personal systems or in public or private cloud services. Today, voice translation services typically run on public cloud services.</p>
<p>“I hope our customers are inspired to try this technology,” Arora said. “I enjoy being able to showcase in challenges like this one the work we do every day.”</p>
<p>The contest is part of <a href="https://syspin.iisc.ac.in/">an initiative</a> to develop open-source datasets and AI models for nine languages most widely spoken in India.</p>
<p>Hear Arora and Badlani share their experiences in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/session-catalog/?tab.allsessions=1700692987788001F1cG&amp;search=S62517#/session/1696286805576001jEsz">a session</a> at GTC next month.</p>
<p>And listen to the results of the team’s model below, starting with a <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/SYSPIN/LIMMITS24_target_speaker_fewshot_samples">three-second sample</a> of a native Kannada speaker:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Chatbots are used by millions of people around the world every day, powered by NVIDIA GPU-based cloud servers. Now, these groundbreaking tools are coming to Windows PCs powered by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a> for local, fast, custom <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chat-with-rtx-generative-ai/">Chat with RTX</a>, now free to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chat-with-rtx-generative-ai/">download</a>, is a tech demo that lets users personalize a chatbot with their own content, accelerated by a local <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU</a> or higher with at least 8GB of video random access memory, or VRAM.</p>
<h2><b>Ask Me Anything</b></h2>
<p>Chat with RTX uses <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a> (RAG), NVIDIA <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ignite-rtx-ai-tensorrt-llm-chat-api/">TensorRT-LLM</a> software and NVIDIA RTX acceleration to bring generative AI capabilities to local, GeForce-powered Windows PCs. Users can quickly, easily connect local files on a PC as a dataset to an open-source <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/">large language model</a> like Mistral or Llama 2, enabling queries for quick, contextually relevant answers.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Create A Personalized AI Chatbot with Chat With RTX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gdsRJZT3IJw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Rather than searching through notes or saved content, users can simply type queries. For example, one could ask, “What was the restaurant my partner recommended while in Las Vegas?” and Chat with RTX will scan local files the user points it to and provide the answer with context.</p>
<p>The tool supports various file formats, including .txt, .pdf, .doc/.docx and .xml. Point the application at the folder containing these files, and the tool will load them into its library in just seconds.</p>
<p>Users can also include information from YouTube videos and playlists. Adding a video URL to Chat with RTX allows users to integrate this knowledge into their chatbot for contextual queries. For example, ask for travel recommendations based on content from favorite influencer videos, or get quick tutorials and how-tos based on top educational resources.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69747" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69747" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chat-with-RTX-Screenshot-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69747" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chat-with-RTX-Screenshot-672x378.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chat-with-RTX-Screenshot-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chat-with-RTX-Screenshot-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chat-with-RTX-Screenshot-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chat-with-RTX-Screenshot-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chat-with-RTX-Screenshot-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chat-with-RTX-Screenshot-800x450.jpg 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chat-with-RTX-Screenshot-382x215.jpg 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chat-with-RTX-Screenshot-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chat-with-RTX-Screenshot-1280x720.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69747" class="wp-caption-text">Chat with RTX can integrate knowledge from YouTube videos into queries.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Since Chat with RTX runs locally on Windows RTX PCs and workstations, the provided results are fast — and the user’s data stays on the device. Rather than relying on cloud-based LLM services, Chat with RTX lets users process sensitive data on a local PC without the need to share it with a third party or have an internet connection.</p>
<p>In addition to a GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU or higher with a minimum 8GB of VRAM, Chat with RTX requires Windows 10 or 11, and the latest NVIDIA GPU drivers.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: We have identified an issue in Chat with RTX that causes installation to fail when the user selects a different installation directory. This will be fixed in a future release. For the time being, users should use the default installation directory (&#8220;C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\NVIDIA\ChatWithRTX&#8221;).</em></p>
<h2><b>Develop LLM-Based Applications With RTX</b></h2>
<p>Chat with RTX shows the potential of accelerating LLMs with RTX GPUs. The app is built from the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/trt-llm-rag-windows">TensorRT-LLM RAG developer reference project, available on GitHub</a>. Developers can use the reference project to develop and deploy their own RAG-based applications for RTX, accelerated by TensorRT-LLM. Learn more about <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/get-started-with-generative-ai-development-for-windows-pcs-with-rtx-systems">building LLM-based applications</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Every country needs to own the production of their own intelligence, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang told attendees Monday at the World Governments Summit in Dubai.</p>
<p>Huang, who spoke as part of a fireside chat with the UAE’s Minister of AI, His Excellency Omar Al Olama, described sovereign AI — which emphasizes a country’s ownership over its data and the intelligence it produces — as an enormous opportunity for the world’s leaders.</p>
<p>“It codifies your culture, your society’s intelligence, your common sense, your history – you own your own data,” Huang told Al Olama during their conversation, a highlight of an event attended by more than 4,000 delegates from 150 countries.</p>
<p>“We completely subscribe to that vision,” Al Olama said. “That’s why the UAE is moving aggressively on creating large language models and mobilizing compute.”</p>
<p>Huang’s appearance in the UAE comes as the Gulf State is moving rapidly to transform itself from an energy powerhouse into a global information technology hub.</p>
<p>Dubai is the latest stop for Huang in a global tour that has included meetings with leaders in Canada, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam over the past six months.<br />
<b><br />
</b>The Middle East is poised to reap significant benefits from AI, with PwC projecting a $320 billion boost to the region’s economy by 2030.</p>
<p>At Monday’s summit, Huang urged leaders not to be “mystified” by AI. AI’s unprecedented ability to take directions from ordinary humans makes it critical for countries to embrace AI, infusing it with local languages and expertise.</p>
<p>In response to Al Olama’s question about how he might approach AI if he were the leader of a developing nation, Huang emphasized the importance of building infrastructure.</p>
<p>“It’s not that costly, it is also not that hard,” Huang said. “The first thing that I would do, of course, is I would codify the language, the data of your culture into your own large language model.”</p>
<p>And as AI and accelerated computing has developed, NVIDIA GPUs have become a platform for one innovation after another.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA GPU is the only platform that’s available to everybody on any platform,” Huang said. “This ubiquity has not only democratized AI but facilitated a wave of innovation that spans from cloud computing to autonomous systems and beyond.</p>
<p>All of this promises to unleash new kinds of innovations that go beyond what’s traditionally been thought of as information technology.</p>
<p>Huang even countered advice offered by many visionaries over the years who urged young people to study computer science in order to compete in the information age. No longer.</p>
<p>“In fact, it’s almost exactly the opposite,” Huang said. “It is our job to create computing technologies that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human: everybody in the world is now a programmer — that is the miracle.”</p>
<p>In a move that further underscores the regional momentum behind AI, Moro Hub, a subsidiary of Digital DEWA, the digital arm of the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, focused on providing cloud services, cybersecurity and smart city solutions, announced Monday it has agreed to build a green data center with NVIDIA.</p>
<p>In addition to the fireside chat, the summit featured panels on smart mobility, sustainable development and more, showcasing the latest in AI advancements. Later in the evening, Huang and Al Olama took the stage at the “Get Inspired” ecosystem event, organized by the UAE’s AI Office, featuring 280 attendees including developers, startups and others.</p>
