										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA today unveiled at SC23 the next wave of technologies that will lift scientific and industrial research centers worldwide to new levels of performance and energy efficiency.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA hardware and software innovations are creating a new class of AI supercomputers,” said Ian Buck, vice president of the company’s high performance computing and hyperscale data center business, in a special address at the conference.</p>
<p>Some of the systems will pack memory-enhanced <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-hopper-architecture-in-depth/">NVIDIA Hopper accelerators</a>, others a new <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-grace-hopper-superchip-powers-jupiter-defining-a-new-class-of-supercomputers-to-propel-ai-for-scientific-discovery">NVIDIA Grace Hopper systems architecture</a>. All will use the expanded parallelism to run a full stack of accelerated software for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>, HPC and hybrid <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-quantum-computing/">quantum computing</a>.</p>
<p>Buck described the new <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-supercharges-hopper-the-worlds-leading-ai-computing-platform">NVIDIA HGX H200</a> as “the world’s leading AI computing platform.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_68062" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68062" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image.jpg"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="size-large wp-image-68062" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image-672x411.jpg" alt="Image of H200 GPU system" width="672" height="411" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image-672x411.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image-400x244.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image-768x469.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image-737x450.jpg 737w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image-352x215.jpg 352w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image-164x100.jpg 164w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image.jpg 1231w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68062" class="wp-caption-text">NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs pack HBM3e memory to run growing generative AI models.</figcaption></figure>
<p>It packs up to 141GB of HBM3e, the first AI accelerator to use the ultrafast technology. Running models like GPT-3, NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs provide an 18x performance increase over prior-generation accelerators.</p>
<p><span>Among other </span><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/release/0.5.0/docs/source/blogs/H200launch.md"><span>generative AI benchmarks</span></a><span>, they zip through 12,000 tokens per second on a Llama2-13B large language model (</span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/"><span>LLM</span></a><span>). </span></p>
<p>Buck also revealed a server platform that links four <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/">NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips</a> on an <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-nvidia-nvlink/">NVIDIA NVLink</a> interconnect. The quad configuration puts in a single compute node a whopping 288 Arm Neoverse cores and 16 petaflops of AI performance with up to 2.3 terabytes of high-speed memory.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68065" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68065" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68065" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration-672x405.jpg" alt="Image of quad GH200 server node" width="672" height="405" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration-672x405.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration-400x241.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration-768x463.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration-747x450.jpg 747w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration-357x215.jpg 357w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration-166x100.jpg 166w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration.jpg 1256w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68065" class="wp-caption-text">Server nodes based on the four GH200 Superchips will deliver 16 petaflops of AI performance.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Demonstrating its efficiency, one GH200 Superchip using the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a> open-source library is 100x faster than a dual-socket x86 CPU system and nearly 2x more energy efficient than an X86 + H100 GPU server.</p>
<p>“Accelerated computing is sustainable computing,” Buck said. “By harnessing the power of accelerated computing and generative AI, together we can drive innovation across industries while reducing our impact on the environment.”</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA Powers 38 of 49 New TOP500 Systems</b></h2>
<p>The latest TOP500 list of the world’s fastest supercomputers reflects the shift toward accelerated, energy-efficient supercomputing.</p>
<p>Thanks to new systems powered by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, NVIDIA now delivers more than 2.5 exaflops of HPC performance across these world-leading systems, up from 1.6 exaflops in the May rankings. NVIDIA’s contribution on the top 10 alone reaches nearly an exaflop of HPC and 72 exaflops of AI performance.</p>
<p>The new list contains the highest number of systems ever using NVIDIA technologies, 379 vs. 372 in May, including 38 of 49 new supercomputers on the list.</p>
<p>Microsoft Azure leads the newcomers with its Eagle system using H100 GPUs in NDv5 instances to hit No. 3 with 561 petaflops. Mare Nostrum5 in Barcelona ranked No. 8, and NVIDIA Eos — which recently set <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/scaling-ai-training-mlperf/">new AI training records</a> on the MLPerf benchmarks — came in at No. 9.</p>
<p>Showing their energy efficiency, NVIDIA GPUs power 23 of the top 30 systems on the Green500. And they retained the No. 1 spot with the H100 GPU-based Henri system, which delivers 65.09 gigaflops per watt for the Flatiron Institute in New York.</p>
<h2><b>Gen AI Explores COVID</b></h2>
<p><span>Showing what’s possible</span>, the Argonne National Laboratory used <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/gpu-cloud/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a>, a generative AI platform for biomolecular LLMs, to develop <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-covid-genome-sequences/">GenSLMs</a>, a model that can generate gene sequences that closely resemble real-world variants of the coronavirus. Using NVIDIA GPUs and data from 1.5 million COVID genome sequences, it can also rapidly identify new virus variants.</p>
<p>The work<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/genomic-large-language-model-predicts-covid-variants/"> won the Gordon Bell special prize</a> last year and was trained on supercomputers, including Argonne’s<a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-turbocharges-extreme-scale-ai-for-argonne-national-laboratorys-polaris-supercomputer"> Polaris</a> system, the U.S. Department of Energy’s<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nersc-perlmutter-ai-supercomputer/"> Perlmutter</a> and NVIDIA’s<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/making-selene-pandemic-ai/"> Selene</a>.</p>
<p>It’s “just the tip of the iceberg — the future is brimming with possibilities, as generative AI continues to redefine the landscape of scientific exploration,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA, in the special address.</p>
<h2><b>Saving Time, Money and Energy</b></h2>
<p>Using the latest technologies, accelerated workloads can see an order-of-magnitude reduction in system cost and energy used, Buck said.</p>
<p>For example, Siemens teamed with Mercedes to analyze aerodynamics and related acoustics for its new electric EQE vehicles. The simulations that took weeks on CPU clusters ran significantly faster using the latest NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In addition, Hopper GPUs let them reduce costs by 3x and reduce energy consumption by 4x (below).</p>

<h2><b>Switching on 200 Exaflops Beginning Next Year</b></h2>
<p>Scientific and industrial advances will come from every corner of the globe where the latest systems are <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gh200-grace-hopper-superchip-powers-ai-supercomputers/">being deployed</a>.</p>
<p>“We already see a combined 200 <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-an-exaflop/">exaflops</a> of AI on Grace Hopper supercomputers going to production 2024,” Buck said.</p>
<p>They include the massive <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-grace-hopper-superchip-powers-jupiter-defining-a-new-class-of-supercomputers-to-propel-ai-for-scientific-discovery">JUPITER supercomputer</a> at Germany’s Jülich center. It can deliver 93 exaflops of performance for AI training and 1 exaflop for HPC applications, while consuming only 18.2 megawatts of power.</p>

<p>Based on Eviden’s BullSequana XH3000 liquid-cooled system, JUPITER will use the NVIDIA quad GH200 system architecture and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/">NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand</a> networking for climate and weather predictions, drug discovery, hybrid quantum computing and digital twins. JUPITER quad GH200 nodes will be configured with 864GB of high-speed memory.</p>
<p>It’s one of several new supercomputers using Grace Hopper that NVIDIA announced at SC23.</p>
<p>The HPE Cray EX2500 system from Hewlett Packard Enterprise will use the quad GH200 to power many AI supercomputers coming online next year.</p>
<p>For example, HPE uses the quad GH200 to power OFP-II, an advanced HPC system in Japan shared by the University of Tsukuba and the University of Tokyo, as well as the DeltaAI system, which will triple computing capacity for the U.S. National Center for Supercomputing Applications.</p>
<p>HPE is also building the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/special-address-isc-2022-hpc/">Venado</a> system for the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the first GH200 to be deployed in the U.S. In addition, HPE is building GH200 supercomputers in the Middle East, Switzerland and the U.K.</p>
<h2><b>Grace Hopper in Texas and Beyond</b></h2>
<p>At the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), Dell Technologies is building the Vista supercomputer with NVIDIA Grace Hopper and Grace CPU Superchips.</p>
<p>More than 100 global enterprises and organizations, including NASA Ames Research Center and Total Energies, have already purchased Grace Hopper early-access systems, Buck said.</p>
<p>They join previously announced GH200 users such as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/computex-keynote-generative-ai/">SoftBank</a> and the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/uk-largest-ai-supercomputer/">University of Bristol</a>, as well as the massive <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/supercomputing-ai-eurohpc/">Leonardo</a> system with 14,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs that delivers 10 exaflops of AI performance for Italy’s Cineca consortium.</p>
<h2><b>The View From Supercomputing Centers</b></h2>
<p>Leaders from supercomputing centers around the world shared their plans and work in progress with the latest systems.</p>
<p>“We’ve been collaborating with MeteoSwiss ECMWP as well as scientists from ETH EXCLAIM and NVIDIA’s Earth-2 project to create an infrastructure that will push the envelope in all dimensions of big data analytics and extreme scale computing,” said Thomas Schultess, director of the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre of work on the Alps supercomputer.</p>
<p>“There’s really impressive energy-efficiency gains across our stacks,” Dan Stanzione, executive director of TACC, said of Vista.</p>
<p>It’s “really the stepping stone to move users from the kinds of systems we’ve done in the past to looking at this new Grace Arm CPU and Hopper GPU tightly coupled combination and … we’re looking to scale out by probably a factor of 10 or 15 from what we are deploying with Vista when we deploy Horizon in a couple years,” he said.</p>
<h2><b>Accelerating the Quantum Journey</b></h2>
<p>Researchers are also using today’s accelerated systems to pioneer a path to tomorrow’s supercomputers.</p>
<p>In Germany, JUPITER “will revolutionize scientific research across climate, materials, drug discovery and quantum computing,” said Kristel Michelson, who leads Julich’s research group on quantum information processing.</p>
<p>“JUPITER’s architecture also allows for the seamless integration of quantum algorithms with parallel HPC algorithms, and this is mandatory for effective quantum HPC hybrid simulations,” she said.</p>
<h2><b>CUDA Quantum Drives Progress</b></h2>
<p>The special address also showed how <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-quantum">NVIDIA CUDA Quantum</a> — a platform for programming CPUs, GPUs and quantum computers also known as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-qpu/">QPUs</a> — is advancing research in quantum computing.</p>
<p>For example, researchers at <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/basf-cuda-quantum-momentum/">BASF</a>, the world’s largest chemical company, pioneered a new hybrid quantum-classical method for simulating chemicals that can shield humans against harmful metals. They join researchers at Brookhaven National Laboratory and HPE who are separately pushing the frontiers of science with CUDA Quantum.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also announced a collaboration with Classiq, a developer of quantum programming tools, to create a life sciences research center at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel’s largest teaching hospital.  The center will use Classiq’s software and CUDA Quantum running on an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-h100/">NVIDIA DGX H100 system</a>.</p>
<p>Separately, Quantum Machines will deploy the first <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-quantum/">NVIDIA DGX Quantum</a>, a system using Grace Hopper Superchips, at the Israel National Quantum Center that aims to drive advances across scientific fields. The DGX system will be connected to a superconducting QPU by Quantware and a photonic QPU from ORCA Computing, both powered by CUDA Quantum.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/quantum-computing-partners.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-68074" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/quantum-computing-partners-672x402.jpg" alt="Logos of NVIDIA CUDA Quantum partners" width="672" height="402" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/quantum-computing-partners-672x402.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/quantum-computing-partners-400x239.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/quantum-computing-partners-768x459.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/quantum-computing-partners-752x450.jpg 752w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/quantum-computing-partners-359x215.jpg 359w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/quantum-computing-partners-167x100.jpg 167w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/quantum-computing-partners.jpg 1227w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>“In just two years, our NVIDIA quantum computing platform has amassed over 120 partners [above], a testament to its open, innovative platform,” Buck said.</p>
<p>Overall, the work across many fields of discovery reveals a new trend that combines accelerated computing at data center scale with NVIDIA’s full-stack innovation.</p>
<p>“Accelerated computing is paving the path for sustainable computing with advancements that provide not just amazing technology but a more sustainable and impactful future,” he concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>A widely acclaimed large language model for genomic data has demonstrated its ability to generate gene sequences that closely resemble real-world variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19.</p>
<p>Called GenSLMs, the model, which last year <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/genomic-large-language-model-predicts-covid-variants/">won the Gordon Bell special prize</a> for high performance computing-based COVID-19 research, was trained on a dataset of nucleotide sequences — the building blocks of DNA and RNA. It was developed by researchers from Argonne National Laboratory, NVIDIA, the University of Chicago and a score of other academic and commercial collaborators.</p>
<p>When the researchers looked back at the nucleotide sequences generated by GenSLMs, they discovered that specific characteristics of the AI-generated sequences closely matched the real-world Eris and Pirola subvariants that have been prevalent this year — even though the AI was only trained on COVID-19 virus genomes from the first year of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Our model’s generative process is extremely naive, lacking any specific information or constraints around what a new COVID variant should look like,” said Arvind Ramanathan, lead researcher on the project and a computational biologist at Argonne. “The AI’s ability to predict the kinds of gene mutations present in recent COVID strains — despite having only seen the Alpha and Beta variants during training — is a strong validation of its capabilities.”</p>
<p>In addition to generating its own sequences, GenSLMs can also classify and cluster different COVID genome sequences by distinguishing between variants. In a demo coming soon to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/">NGC</a>, NVIDIA’s hub for accelerated software, users can explore visualizations of GenSLMs’ analysis of the evolutionary patterns of various proteins within the COVID viral genome.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Reading Between the Lines, Uncovering Evolutionary Patterns</b></h2>
<p>A key feature of GenSLMs is its ability to interpret long strings of nucleotides — represented with sequences of the letters A, T, G and C in DNA, or A, U, G and C in RNA — in the same way an LLM trained on English text would interpret a sentence. This capability enables the model to understand the relationship between different areas of the genome, which in coronaviruses consists of around 30,000 nucleotides.</p>
<p>In the demo, users will be able to choose from among eight different COVID variants to understand how the AI model tracks mutations across various proteins of the viral genome. The visualization depicts evolutionary couplings across the viral proteins — highlighting which snippets of the genome are likely to be seen in a given variant.</p>
<p>“Understanding how different parts of the genome are co-evolving gives us clues about how the virus may develop new vulnerabilities or new forms of resistance,” Ramanathan said. “Looking at the model’s understanding of which mutations are particularly strong in a variant may help scientists with downstream tasks like determining how a specific strain can evade the human immune system.”</p>

<p>GenSLMs was trained on more than 110 million prokaryotic genome sequences and fine-tuned with a global dataset of around 1.5 million COVID viral sequences using open-source data from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center. In the future, the model could be fine-tuned on the genomes of other viruses or bacteria, enabling new research applications.</p>
<p>To train the model, the researchers used <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU</a>-powered supercomputers, including Argonne’s <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-turbocharges-extreme-scale-ai-for-argonne-national-laboratorys-polaris-supercomputer">Polaris</a> system, the U.S. Department of Energy’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nersc-perlmutter-ai-supercomputer/">Perlmutter</a> and NVIDIA’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/making-selene-pandemic-ai/">Selene</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Michael Kuehn and Davide Vodola are taking to new heights work that’s pioneering <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-quantum-computing/">quantum computing</a> for the world’s largest chemical company.</p>
<p>The BASF researchers are demonstrating how a quantum algorithm can see what no traditional simulation can — key attributes of NTA, a compound with applications that include removing toxic metals like iron from a city’s wastewater.</p>
<p>The quantum computing team at BASF simulated on GPUs how the equivalent of 24 qubits — the processing engines of a quantum computer — can tackle the challenge.</p>
<p>Many corporate R&amp;D centers would consider that a major achievement, but they pressed on, and recently ran their first 60 qubit simulations on NVIDIA’s Eos H100 Supercomputer.</p>
<p>“It’s the largest simulation of a molecule using a quantum algorithm we’ve ever run,” said Kuehn.</p>
<h2><b>Flexible, Friendly Software</b></h2>
<p>BASF is running the simulation on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-quantum">NVIDIA CUDA Quantum</a>, a platform for programming CPUs, GPUs and quantum computers, also known as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-qpu/">QPUs</a>.</p>
<p>Vodola described it as “very flexible and user friendly, letting us build up a complex quantum circuit simulation from relatively simple building blocks. Without CUDA Quantum, it would be impossible to run this simulation,” he said.</p>
<p>The work requires a lot of heavy lifting, too, so BASF turned to an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a> service that uses <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>.</p>
<p>“We need a lot of computing power, and the NVIDIA platform is significantly faster than CPU-based hardware for this kind of simulation,” said Kuehn.</p>
<p>BASF’s quantum computing initiative, which Kuehn helped launch, started in 2017. In addition to its work in chemistry, the team is developing use cases for quantum computing in machine learning as well as optimizations for logistics and scheduling.</p>
<h2><b>An Expanding CUDA Quantum Community</b></h2>
<p>Other research groups are also advancing science with CUDA Quantum.</p>
<p>At SUNY Stony Brook, researchers are pushing the boundaries of high-energy physics to simulate complex interactions of subatomic particles. Their work promises new discoveries in fundamental physics.</p>
<p>“CUDA Quantum enables us to do quantum simulations that would otherwise be impossible,” said Dmitri Kharzeev,  a SUNY professor and scientist at Brookhaven National Lab.</p>
<p>In addition, a research team at Hewlett Packard Labs is using the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nersc-perlmutter-ai-supercomputer/">Perlmutter supercomputer</a> to explore magnetic phase transition in quantum chemistry in one of the largest simulations of its kind. The effort could reveal important and unknown details of physical processes too difficult to model with conventional techniques.</p>
<p>“As quantum computers progress toward useful applications, high-performance classical simulations will be key for prototyping novel quantum algorithms,” said Kirk Bresniker, a chief architect at Hewlett Packard Labs. “Simulating and learning from quantum data are promising avenues toward tapping quantum computing’s potential.”</p>
<h2><b>A Quantum Center for Healthcare</b></h2>
<p>These efforts come as support for CUDA Quantum expands worldwide.</p>
<p>Classiq — an Israeli startup that already has more than 400 universities using its novel approach to writing quantum programs — <a href="https://classiq.io/insights/classiq-announces-quantum-center-for-life-sciences-in-collaboration-with-nvidia">announced </a>today a new research center at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel’s largest teaching hospital.</p>
<p>Created in collaboration with NVIDIA, it will train experts in life science to write quantum applications that could someday help doctors diagnose diseases or accelerate the discovery of new drugs.</p>
<p>Classiq created quantum design software that automates low-level tasks, so developers don’t need to know all the complex details of how a quantum computer works. It’s now being integrated with CUDA Quantum.</p>
<p>Terra Quantum, a quantum services company with headquarters in Germany and Switzerland, is developing hybrid quantum applications for life sciences, energy, chemistry and finance that will run on CUDA Quantum. And IQM in Finland is enabling its superconducting QPU to use CUDA Quantum.</p>
<h2><b>Quantum Loves Grace Hopper</b></h2>
<p>Several companies, including Oxford Quantum Circuits, will use <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/">NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips</a> to power their hybrid quantum efforts. Based in Reading, England, Oxford Quantum is using Grace Hopper in a hybrid QPU/GPU system programmed by CUDA Quantum.</p>
<p>Quantum Machines announced that the Israeli National Quantum Center will be the first deployment of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-quantum/">NVIDIA DGX Quantum</a>, a system using Grace Hopper Superchips. Based in Tel Aviv, the center will tap DGX Quantum to power quantum computers from Quantware, ORCA Computing and more.</p>
<p>In addition, Grace Hopper is being put to work by qBraid, in Chicago, to build a quantum cloud service, and Fermioniq, in Amsterdam, to develop tensor-network algorithms.</p>
<p>The large quantity of shared memory and the memory bandwidth of Grace Hopper make these superchips an excellent fit for memory-hungry quantum simulations.</p>
<p>Get started programming hybrid quantum systems today with the latest release of CUDA Quantum from <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/cuda-quantum">NGC</a>, NVIDIA’s catalog of accelerated software, or <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum">GitHub</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Thanks to a viral trend sweeping social media, we now know some men think about the Roman Empire every day.</p>
<p>And thanks to Luke Farritor, a 21-year-old computer science undergrad at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and like-minded AI enthusiasts, there might soon be a lot more to think about.</p>
<p>Blending a passion for history with machine learning skills, Farritor has triumphed in the Vesuvius Challenge, wielding the power of the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 GPU to bring a snippet of ancient text back from the ashes after almost 2,000 years.</p>
<h2>Text Big Thing: Deciphering Rome’s Hidden History</h2>
<p>The Herculaneum scrolls are a library of ancient texts that were carbonized and preserved by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, which buried the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum under a thick layer of ash and pumice.</p>
<p>The competition, which has piqued the interest of historians and technologists across the globe, seeks to extract readable content from the carbonized remains of the scrolls.</p>
<p>In a significant breakthrough, the word “πορφυρας,” which means “purple dye” or “cloths of purple,” emerged from the ancient texts thanks to the efforts of Farritor.</p>
<figure id="attachment_35262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35262" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-35262 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll-672x448.jpg" alt="The Herculaneum scrolls, wound about 100 times around, are sealed by the heat of the lava." width="672" height="448" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll-672x448.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll-676x451.jpg 676w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll-328x219.jpg 328w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-35262" class="wp-caption-text">The Herculaneum scrolls, wound about 100 times around, are sealed by the heat of the eruption of Vesuvius.</figcaption></figure>
<p>His achievement in identifying 10 letters within a small patch of scroll earned him a $40,000 prize.</p>
<p>Close on his heels was Youssef Nader, a biorobotics graduate student, who independently discerned the same word a few months later, meriting a $10,000 prize.</p>
<p>Adding to these notable successes, Casey Handmer, an entrepreneur with a keen eye, secured another $10,000 for his demonstration that significant amounts of ink were waiting to be discovered within the unopened scrolls.</p>
<p>All these discoveries are advancing the work pioneered by W. Brent Seales, chair of the University of Kentucky Computer Science Department, who has dedicated over a decade to developing methods to digitally unfurl and read the delicate Herculaneum scrolls.</p>
<p>Turbocharging these efforts is Nat Friedman, the CEO of GitHub and the organizer of the Vesuvius Challenge, whose commitment to open-source innovation has fostered a community where such historical breakthroughs are possible.</p>
<p>To become the first to decipher text from the scrolls, Farritor, who served as an intern at SpaceX, harnessed the GeForce GTX 1070 to accelerate his work.</p>
<h2>When Rome Meets RAM: Older GPU Helps Uncover Even Older Text</h2>
<p>Introduced in 2016, the GTX 1070 is celebrated among gamers, who have long praised the GPU for its balance of performance and affordability.</p>
<p>Instead of gaming, however, Farritor harnessed the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU to accelerate the ResNet deep learning framework, processing data at speeds unattainable by traditional computing methods.</p>
<p>Farritor is not the only competitor harnessing NVIDIA GPUs, which have proven themselves as indispensable tools to Vesuvius challenge competitors.</p>
<h2>Latin Lingo and Lost Text</h2>
<p>Discovered in the 18th century in the Villa of the Papyri, the Herculaneum scrolls have presented a challenge to researchers. Their fragile state has made them nearly impossible to read without causing damage. The advent of advanced imaging and AI technology changed that.</p>
<p>The project has become a passion for Farritor, who finds himself struggling to recall more of the Latin he studied in high school. “And man, like what’s in the scrolls &#8230; it’s just the anticipation, you know?” Farritor said.</p>
<p>The next challenge is to unearth passages from the Herculaneum scrolls that are 144 characters long, echoing the brevity of an original Twitter post.</p>
<p>Engaging over 1,500 experts in a collaborative effort, the endeavor is now more heated than ever.</p>
<p>Private donors have upped the ante, offering a $700,000 prize for those who can retrieve four distinct passages of at least 140 characters this year — a testament to the value placed on these ancient texts and the lengths required to reclaim them.</p>
<p>And Farritor’s eager to keep digging, reeling off the names of lost works of Roman and Greek history that he’d love to help uncover.</p>
<p>He reports he’s now thinking about Rome — and what his efforts might help discover — not just every day now, but “every hour.” “I think anything that sheds light on that time in human history is gonna be significant,” Farritor said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA’s AI platform raised the bar for AI training and high performance computing in the latest <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/mlperf-benchmarks/">MLPerf</a> industry benchmarks.</p>
<p>Among many new records and milestones, one in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> stands out: <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-dgx-h100-systems-worlds-most-advanced-enterprise-ai-infrastructure">NVIDIA Eos</a> — an AI supercomputer powered by a whopping 10,752 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/">NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand</a> networking — completed a training benchmark based on a GPT-3 model with 175 billion parameters trained on one billion tokens in just 3.9 minutes.</p>
<p>That’s a nearly 3x gain from 10.9 minutes, the record NVIDIA set when the test <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-debut-mlperf/">was introduced</a> less than six months ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67961" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-672x422.jpg" alt="NVIDIA H100 training results over time on MLPerf benchmarks" width="672" height="422" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-672x422.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-400x251.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-768x483.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-716x450.jpg 716w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-342x215.jpg 342w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-159x100.jpg 159w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>The benchmark uses a portion of the full GPT-3 data set behind the popular ChatGPT service that, by extrapolation, Eos could now train in just eight days, 73x faster than a prior state-of-the-art system using 512 A100 GPUs.</p>
<p>The acceleration in training time reduces costs, saves energy and speeds time-to-market. It’s heavy lifting that makes large language models widely available so every business can adopt them with tools like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, a framework for customizing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">LLMs</a>.</p>
<p>In a new generative AI test ‌this round, 1,024 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/hopper-architecture/">NVIDIA Hopper architecture GPUs</a> completed a training benchmark based on the Stable Diffusion text-to-image model in 2.5 minutes, setting a high bar on this new workload.</p>
<p>By adopting these two tests, MLPerf reinforces its leadership as the industry standard for measuring AI performance, since generative AI is the most transformative technology of our time.</p>
<h2><b>System Scaling Soars</b></h2>
<p>The latest results were due in part to the use of the most accelerators ever applied to an MLPerf benchmark. The 10,752 H100 GPUs far surpassed the scaling in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-debut-mlperf/">AI training</a> in June, when NVIDIA used 3,584 Hopper GPUs.</p>
<p>The 3x scaling in GPU numbers delivered a 2.8x scaling in performance, a 93% efficiency rate thanks in part to software optimizations.</p>
<p>Efficient scaling is a key requirement in generative AI because LLMs are growing by <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/huangs-law-dally-hot-chips/">an order of magnitude every year</a>. The latest results show NVIDIA’s ability to meet this unprecedented challenge for even the world’s largest data centers.</p>

<p>The achievement is thanks to a full-stack platform of innovations in accelerators, systems and software that both Eos and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nd-h100-v5-series">Microsoft Azure</a> used in the latest round.</p>
<p>Eos and Azure both employed 10,752 H100 GPUs in separate submissions. They achieved within 2% of the same performance, demonstrating the efficiency of NVIDIA AI in data center and public-cloud deployments.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67967" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-672x378.jpg" alt="Chart of record Azure scaling in MLPerf training" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-800x450.jpg 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-382x215.jpg 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>NVIDIA relies on Eos for a wide array of critical jobs. It helps advance initiatives like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS</a>, AI-powered software for state-of-the-art computer graphics and NVIDIA Research projects like <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/llm-semiconductors-chip-nemo/">ChipNeMo</a>, generative AI tools that help design next-generation GPUs.</p>
<h2><b>Advances Across Workloads</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA set several new records in this round in addition to making advances in generative AI.</p>
<p>For example, H100 GPUs were 1.6x faster than the prior-round training recommender models widely employed to help users find what they’re looking for online. Performance was up 1.8x on RetinaNet, a computer vision model.</p>
<p>These increases came from a combination of advances in software and scaled-up hardware.</p>
<p>NVIDIA was once again the only company to run all MLPerf tests. H100 GPUs demonstrated the fastest performance and the greatest scaling in each of the nine benchmarks.</p>

<p>Speedups translate to faster time to market, lower costs and energy savings for users training massive LLMs or customizing them with frameworks like NeMo for the specific needs of their business.</p>
<p>Eleven systems makers used the NVIDIA AI platform in their submissions this round, including ASUS, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Lenovo, QCT and Supermicro.</p>
<p>NVIDIA partners participate in MLPerf because they know it’s a valuable tool for customers evaluating AI platforms and vendors.</p>
<h2><b>HPC Benchmarks Expand</b></h2>
<p>In MLPerf HPC, a separate benchmark for AI-assisted simulations on supercomputers, H100 GPUs delivered up to twice the performance of NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/mlperf-hpc-ai/">the last HPC round</a>. The results showed up to 16x gains since the first MLPerf HPC round in 2019.</p>
<p>The benchmark included a new test that trains OpenFold, a model that predicts the 3D structure of a protein from its sequence of amino acids. OpenFold can do in minutes vital work for healthcare that used to take researchers weeks or months.</p>
<p>Understanding a protein’s structure is key to finding effective drugs fast because most drugs act on proteins, the cellular machinery that helps control many biological processes.</p>
<p>In the MLPerf HPC test, H100 GPUs trained OpenFold in 7.5 minutes.  The OpenFold test is a representative part of the entire AlphaFold training process that two years ago took 11 days using 128 accelerators.</p>
<p>A version of the OpenFold model and the software NVIDIA used to train it will be available soon in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a>, a generative AI platform for drug discovery.</p>
<p>Several partners made submissions on the NVIDIA AI platform in this round. They included Dell Technologies and supercomputing centers at Clemson University, the Texas Advanced Computing Center and — with assistance from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) — Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</p>
<h2><b>Benchmarks With Broad Backing</b></h2>
<p>Since its inception in May 2018, the MLPerf benchmarks have enjoyed broad backing from both industry and academia. Organizations that support them include Amazon, Arm, Baidu, Google, Harvard, HPE, Intel, Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Stanford University and the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>MLPerf tests are transparent and objective, so users can rely on the results to make informed buying decisions.</p>
<p>All the software NVIDIA used is available from the MLPerf repository, so all developers can get the same world-class results. These software optimizations get continuously folded into containers available on <a href="https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog">NGC</a>, NVIDIA’s software hub for GPU applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Clinician-led healthcare AI company <a href="https://harrison.ai/">Harrison.ai</a> has built an AI system that effectively serves as a “spell checker” for radiologists — flagging critical findings to improve the speed and accuracy of radiology image analysis, reducing misdiagnoses.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of NVIDIA’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/ai-podcast/">AI Podcast</a>, host Noah Kravitz spoke with Harrison.ai cofounder and CEO Aengus Tran about the company’s mission to scale global healthcare capacity with autonomous AI systems.</p>
<p>Harrison.ai’s initial product, Annalise.ai, is an AI tool that automates radiology image analysis to enable faster, more accurate diagnoses. It can produce 124-130 different possible diagnoses and flag key findings to aid radiologists in their final diagnosis. Currently, Annalise.ai works for chest X-rays and brain CT scans, with more on the way.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1658401437%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-GBoYrNuokCy&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>

<p>While an AI designed for categorizing traffic lights, for example, doesn’t need perfection, medical tools must be highly accurate — any oversight could be fatal. To overcome this challenge, annalise.ai was trained on millions of meticulously annotated images — some were annotated three to five times over before being used for training.</p>
<p>Harrison.ai is also developing Franklin.ai, a sibling AI tool aimed at accelerating and improving the accuracy of histopathology diagnosis — in which a clinician performs a biopsy and inspects the tissue for the presence of cancerous cells. Similarly to Annalise.ai, Franklin.ai flags critical findings to assist pathologists in speeding and increasing the accuracy of diagnoses.</p>
<p>Ethical concerns about AI use are ever rising, but for Tran, the concern is less about whether it’s ethical to use AI for medical diagnosis but “actually the converse: Is it ethical to <i>not</i> use AI for medical diagnosis,” especially if “humans using those AI systems simply pick up more misdiagnosis, pick up more cancer and conditions?”</p>
<p>Tran also talked about the future of AI systems and suggested that the focus is dual: first, focus on improving preexisting systems and then think of new cutting-edge solutions.</p>
<p>And for those looking to break into careers in AI and healthcare, Tran says that the “first step is to decide upfront what problems you’re willing to spend a huge part of your time solving first, before the AI part,” emphasizing that the “first thing is actually to fall in love with some problem.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of our weekly </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/in-the-nvidia-studio/"><i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/"><i>NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> technology improves creative workflows. We’re also deep-diving on new </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/"><i>GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU</i></a><i> features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.</i></p>
<p>Taiwanese artist Steven Tung creates captivating 2D and 3D digital art that explores sci-fi, minimalism and realism and pushes artistic boundaries.</p>
<p>This week <i>In the NVIDIA Studio,</i> Tung shares the inspiration and creative workflow behind his whimsical animation, <i>The Given Fish</i>.</p>
<p>Professional-grade technology, which was once available only at select special effects studios, is becoming increasingly accessible.</p>
<p>“Visual production capabilities continue to skyrocket, generating a growing demand for better computer hardware among the general public,” Tung said. “The evolving synergy between art and technology can spark endless possibilities for creators.”</p>
<p>Tung uses an <a href="https://www.msi.com/Desktop/MEG-Trident-X2-13th">MSI MEG Trident X2 desktop</a>, powered by GeForce RTX 4090 graphics, to accelerate his creative workflow.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67876" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67876" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67876" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67876" class="wp-caption-text">The MSI MEG Trident X2 desktop, powered by GeForce RTX 4090 graphics.</figcaption></figure>
<p>“The enhanced speed and performance expedites various processes, such as updating material textures in Adobe Substance 3D Painter and rendering in Blender,” said Tung. “The necessary specifications and requirements align, enabling maximum creativity without limitations.”</p>
<h2><b>Exquisite Visuals Made E-fish-ciently</b></h2>
<p>Tung’s 3D animation, <i>The Given Fish</i>, may look simple at first glance — but it’s surprisingly complex.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>“GeForce RTX GPUs are indispensable hardware for 3D rendering tasks. Faster speeds bring significant benefits in production efficiency and time saved.” — Steven Tung</p>
</div>
<p>In the creative world behind the animation, the stone fish depicted can be consumed by people. The concept is that once taken out of the aquarium, the stone fish transforms into a real, living one.</p>
<p>“I have a strong desire to have an aquarium at home, but it’s not practical,” said Tung. “The next best thing is to turn that emotion into art.”</p>
<p>Tung began by creating concept sketches in Adobe Photoshop, where he had access to over 30 GPU-accelerated features that could help modify and adjust his canvas and maximize his efficiency.</p>

<p>Next, Tung jumped from 2D to 3D with ZBrush. He first built a basic model and then refined critical details with custom brushes — adding greater depth and dimension with authentic, hand-sculpted textures.</p>

<p>He then used the UV unwrapping feature in RizomUV to ensure that his models were properly unwrapped and ready for texture application.</p>

<p>Tung imported the models into Adobe 3D Substance Painter, where he meticulously painted textures, blended materials and used the built-in library to achieve lifelike stone textures. RTX-accelerated light and ambient occlusion baking optimized his assets in seconds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Embodying the convergence of AI and academia, the University of Florida Friday inaugurated the Malachowsky Hall for Data Science &amp; Information Technology.</p>
<p>The sleek, seven-story building is poised to play a pivotal role in UF’s ongoing efforts to harness the transformative power of AI, reaffirming its stature as one of the nation’s leading public universities.</p>
<p>Evoking Apple co-founder Steve Jobs’ iconic description of a personal computer, NVIDIA’s founder and CEO Jensen Huang described Malachowsky Hall — named for NVIDIA co-founder Chris Malachowsky — and the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/university-of-florida-nvidia-ai-supercomputer/">HiPerGator AI supercomputer</a> it hosts as a “starship for knowledge discovery.”</p>
<p>“Steve Jobs called (the PC) ‘the bicycle of the mind,’ a device that propels our thoughts further and faster,” Huang said.</p>
<p>“What Chris Malachowsky has gifted this institution is nothing short of the ‘starship of the mind’ — a vehicle that promises to take our intellect to uncharted territories,” Huang said.</p>
<p>The inauguration of the 260,000-square-foot structure marks a milestone in the partnership between UF alum Malachowsky, NVIDIA and the state of Florida — a collaboration that has propelled UF to the forefront of AI innovation.</p>
<p>Malachowsky and NVIDIA both made major contributions toward its construction, bolstered by a $110 million investment from the state of Florida.</p>

<p>Following the opening, Huang and UF’s new president, Ben Sasse, met to discuss the impact of AI and data science across UF and beyond for students just starting their careers.</p>
<p>Sasse underscored the importance of adaptability in a rapidly changing world, telling the audience: “work in lots and lots of different organizations … because lifelong work in any one, not just firm, but any one industry is going to end in our lives. You’re ultimately going to have to figure out how to reinvent yourselves at 30, 35, 40 and 45.”</p>
<p>Huang offered students very different advice, recalling how he met his wife, Lori, who was in the audience, as an undergraduate. “Have a good pickup line … do you want to know the pickup line?” Huang asked, pausing a beat. “You want to see my homework?”</p>
<p>The spirit of Sasse and Huang’s adaptable approach to career and personal development is embodied in Malachowsky Hall, designed to bring together people from academia and industry, research and government.</p>
<p>Packed with innovative collaboration spaces and labs, the hall features a spacious 400-seat auditorium, dedicated high-performance computing study spaces and a rooftop terrace that unveils panoramic campus vistas.</p>
<p>Sustainability is woven into its design, highlighted by energy-efficient systems and rainwater harvesting facilities.</p>
<p>Malachowsky Hall will serve as a conduit to bring the on-campus advances in AI to Florida’s thriving economy, which continues to outpace the nation in jobs and GDP growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The world’s <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring23-S51404/">5 billion</a> internet users and nearly 54 billion devices generate <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US49346123&amp;pageType=PRINTFRIENDLY">3.4 petabytes of data per second</a>, according to IDC. As digitalization accelerates, enterprise IT teams are under greater pressure to identify and block incoming cyber threats to ensure business operations and services are not interrupted — and AI-based cybersecurity provides a reliable way to do so.</p>
<p>Few industries appear immune to cyber threats. This year alone, international hotel chains, financial institutions, Fortune 100 retailers, air traffic-control systems and the U.S. government have all reported threats and intrusions.</p>
<p>Whether from insider error, cybercriminals, hacktivists or other threats, risks in the cyber landscape can damage an enterprise’s reputation and bottom line. A breach can paralyze operations, jeopardize proprietary and customer data, result in regulatory fines and destroy customer trust.</p>
<p>Using AI and accelerated computing, businesses can reduce the time and operational expenses required to detect and block cyber threats while freeing up resources to focus on core business value operations and revenue-generating activities.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at how industries are applying AI techniques to safeguard data, enable faster threat detection and mitigate attacks to ensure the consistent delivery of service to customers and partners.</p>
<h2><strong>Public Sector: Protecting Physical Security, Energy Security and Citizen Services</strong></h2>
<p>AI-powered analytics and automation tools are helping government agencies provide citizens with instant access to information and services, make data-driven decisions, model climate change, manage natural disasters, and more. But <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/public-sector/">public entities</a> managing digital tools and infrastructure face a complex cyber risk environment that includes regulatory compliance requirements, public scrutiny, large interconnected networks and the need to protect sensitive data and high-value targets.</p>
<p>Adversary nation-states may initiate cyberattacks to disrupt networks, steal intellectual property or swipe classified government documents. Internal misuse of digital tools and infrastructure combined with sophisticated external espionage places public organizations at high risk of data breach. Espionage actors have also been known to recruit inside help, with <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">16% of public administration breaches</a> showing evidence of collusion. To protect critical infrastructure, citizen data, public records and other sensitive information, federal organizations are turning to AI.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security and Emergency Response (CESER) is tasked with strengthening the resilience of the country’s energy sector by addressing emerging threats and improving energy infrastructure security. The DOE-CESER has invested more than <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ceser/cybersecurity-research-development-and-demonstration-rdd-energy-delivery-systems">$240 million</a> in cybersecurity research, development and demonstration projects since 2010.</p>
<p>In one project, the department developed a tool that uses AI to <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-08/Security%20Patch%20Automated%20Remediation%20Tool%20Analyzing%20the%20NVD%20%28SPARTAN%29%20-%20SEEDS_508.pdf">automate and optimize security vulnerability and patch management</a> in energy delivery systems. Another project for <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-11/ADDSec%20Artificial%20Diversity%20and%20Defense%20Security%20-%20SNL.pdf">artificial diversity and defense security</a> uses software-defined networks to enhance the situational awareness of energy delivery systems, helping ensure uninterrupted flows of energy.</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is charged with researching and investing in breakthrough technologies for national security, is using machine learning and AI in several areas. The <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/cyber-agents-for-security-testing-and-learning-environments">DARPA CASTLE program</a> trains AI to defend against advanced, persistent cyber threats. As part of the effort, researchers intend to accelerate cybersecurity assessments with approaches that are automated, repeatable and measurable. The <a href="https://www.gardproject.org/">DARPA GARD program</a> builds platforms, libraries, datasets and training materials to help developers build AI models that are resistant to deception and adversarial attacks.</p>
<p>To keep up with an evolving threat landscape and ensure physical security, energy security and data security, public organizations must continue integrating AI to achieve a dynamic, proactive and far-reaching cyber defense posture.</p>
<h2><strong>Financial Services: Securing Digital Transactions, Payments and Portfolios </strong></h2>
<p>Banks, asset managers, insurers and other financial service organizations are using AI and machine learning to deliver superior performance in fraud detection, portfolio management, algorithmic trading and self-service banking.</p>
<p>With constant digital transactions, payments, loans and investment trades, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/finance/">financial service institutions</a> manage some of the largest, most complex and most sensitive datasets of any industry. Behind only the healthcare industry, these organizations suffer the second highest cost of a data breach, at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/E3G5JMBP">nearly $6 million</a> per incident. This cost grows if regulators issue fines or if recovery includes legal fees and lawsuit settlements. Worse still, lost business may never be recovered if trust can’t be repaired.</p>
<p>Banks and financial institutions use AI to improve insider threat detection, detect phishing and ransomware, and keep sensitive information safe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring23-S51437/">FinSec Innovation Lab</a>, a joint venture by Mastercard and Enel X, is using AI to help its customers defend against ransomware. Prior to working with FinSec, one card-processing customer suffered a LockBit ransomware attack in which 200 company servers were infected in just 1.5 hours. The company was forced to shut down servers and suspend operations, resulting in an estimated $7 million in lost business.</p>
<p>FinSec replicated this attack in its lab but deployed the <a href="http://nvidia.com/morpheus">NVIDIA Morpheus</a> cybersecurity framework, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/networking/doca">NVIDIA DOCA</a> software framework for intrusion detection and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/data-processing-unit/">NVIDIA BlueField DPU</a> computing clusters. With this mix of AI and accelerated computing, FinSec was able to detect the ransomware attack in less than 12 seconds, quickly isolate virtual machines and recover 80% of the data on infected servers. This type of real-time response helps businesses avoid service downtime and lost business while maintaining customer trust.</p>
<p>With AI to help defend against cyberattacks, financial institutions can identify intrusions and anticipate future threats to keep financial records, accounts and transactions secure.</p>
<h2><strong>Retail: Keeping Sales Channels and Payment Credentials Safe</strong></h2>
<p>Retailers are using AI to power personalized product recommendations, dynamic pricing and customized marketing campaigns. Multichannel digital platforms have made in-store and online shopping more convenient: up to <a href="https://navigate.visa.com/na/spending-insights/seven-ways-to-use-card-on-file-to-reach-top-of-digital-wallet/">48% of consumers</a> save a card on file with a merchant, significantly boosting card-not-present transactions. While digitization has brought convenience, it has also made sensitive data more accessible to attackers.</p>
<p>Sitting on troves of digital payment credentials for millions of customers, retailers are a prime target for cybercriminals looking to take advantage of security gaps. According to a recent <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/2023/master-guide/">Data Breach Investigations Report</a> from Verizon, 37% of confirmed data disclosures in the retail industry resulted in stolen payment card data.</p>
<p>Malware attacks, ransomware and distributed denial of service attacks are all on the rise, but phishing remains the favored vector for an initial attack. With a successful phishing intrusion, criminals can steal credentials, access systems and launch ransomware.</p>
<p>Best Buy manages a network of more than 1,000 stores across the U.S. and Canada. With multichannel digital sales across both countries, protecting consumer information and transactions is critical. To defend against phishing and other cyber threats, Best Buy began using customized machine learning and NVIDIA Morpheus to better secure their infrastructure and inform their security analysts.</p>
<p>After deploying this AI-based cyber defense, the retail giant improved the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-morpheus-helps-defend-against-spear-phishing-with-generative-ai/">accuracy of phishing detection to 96%</a> while reducing false-positive rates. With a proactive approach to cybersecurity, Best Buy is protecting its reputation as a tech expert focused on customer needs.</p>
<p>From complex supply chains to third-party vendors and multichannel point-of-sale networks, expect <a href="https://info.nvidia.com/retail-cybersecurity-webinar.html">retailers to continue integrating AI</a> to protect operations as well as critical proprietary and customer data.</p>
<h2><strong>Smart Cities and Spaces: Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Transit Networks</strong></h2>
<p>IoT devices and AI that analyze movement patterns, traffic and hazardous situations have great potential to improve the safety and efficiency of spaces and infrastructure. But as airports, shipping ports, transit networks and other <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/smart-cities-and-spaces/">smart spaces</a> integrate IoT and use data, they also become more vulnerable to attack.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, there have been distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on airports and air traffic control centers and ransomware attacks on seaports, city municipalities, police departments and more. Attacks can paralyze information systems, ground flights, disrupt the flow of cargo and traffic, and delay the delivery of goods to markets. Hostile attacks could have far more serious consequences, including physical harm or loss of life.</p>
<p>In connected spaces, AI-driven security can analyze vast amounts of data to predict threats, isolate attacks and provide rapid self-healing after an intrusion. AI algorithms trained on emails can halt threats in the inbox and block phishing attempts like those that delivered <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/06/tech/japan-port-ransomware-attack/index.html">ransomware to seaports earlier</a> this year. Machine learning can be trained to recognize DDoS attack patterns to prevent the type of incoming malicious traffic that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-atlanta-680cf93f7eb0300127448c35299ad66e">brought down U.S. airport websites</a> last year.</p>
<p>Organizations adopting smart space technology, such as the Port of Los Angeles, are making efforts to get ahead of the threat landscape. In 2014, the Port of LA established a cybersecurity operations center and hired a dedicated cybersecurity team. In 2021, the port followed up with a cyber resilience center to enhance early-warning detection for cyberattacks that have the potential to impact the flow of cargo.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has developed an <a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2022-08/PL_115-254_Sec_741_Certification_of_New_Technologies_into_the_NAS.pdf">AI certification framework</a> that assesses the trustworthiness of AI and ML applications. The FAA also implements a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-zero-trust/">zero-trust</a> cyber approach, enforces strict access control and runs continuous verification across its digital environment.</p>
<p>By bolstering cybersecurity and integrating AI, smart space and transport infrastructure administrators can offer secure access to physical spaces and digital networks to protect the uninterrupted movement of people and goods.</p>
<h2><strong>Telecommunications: Ensure Network Resilience and Block Incoming Threats</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/telecommunications/">Telecommunications</a> companies are leaning into AI to power predictive maintenance and maximum network uptime, network optimization, equipment troubleshooting, call-routing and self-service systems.</p>
<p>The industry is responsible for critical national infrastructure in every country, supports over <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/telco-survey-ai/">5 billion</a> customer endpoints and is expected to constantly deliver above 99% reliability. As reliance on cloud, IoT and edge computing expands and 5G becomes the norm, immense digital surface areas must be protected from misuse and malicious attack.</p>
<p>Telcos can deploy AI to ensure the security and resilience of networks. AI can monitor IoT devices and edge networks to detect anomalies and intrusions, identify fake users, mitigate attacks and quarantine infected devices. AI can continuously assess the trustworthiness of devices, users and applications, thereby shortening the time needed to identify fraudsters.</p>
<p>Pretrained AI models can be deployed to protect 5G networks from threats such as malware, data exfiltration and DOS attacks.</p>
<p>Using deep learning and NVIDIA BlueField DPUs, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/palo-alto-networks-cyber-defenses/">Palo Alto Networks</a> has built a next-generation firewall addressing 5G needs, maximizing cybersecurity performance while maintaining a small infrastructure footprint. The DPU powers accelerated intelligent network filtering to parse, classify and steer traffic to improve performance and isolate threats. With more efficient computing that deploys fewer servers, telcos can maximize return on investment for compute investments and minimize digital attack surface areas.</p>
<p>By putting AI to work, telcos can build secure, encrypted networks to ensure network availability and data security for both individual and enterprise customers.</p>
<h2><strong>Automotive: Insulate Vehicle Software From Outside Influence and Attack </strong></h2>
<p>Modern cars <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/">rely on complex AI and ML</a> software stacks running on in-vehicle computers to process data from cameras and other sensors. These vehicles are essentially giant, moving IoT devices — they perceive the environment, make decisions, advise drivers and even control the vehicle with autonomous driving features.</p>
<p>Like other connected devices, autonomous vehicles are susceptible to various types of cyberattacks. Bad actors can infiltrate and compromise AV software both on board and from third-party providers. Denial of service attacks can disrupt over-the-air software updates that vehicles rely on to operate safely. Unauthorized access to communications systems like onboard WiFi, Bluetooth or RFID can expose vehicle systems to the risk of remote manipulation and data theft. This can jeopardize geolocation and sensor data, operational data, driver and passenger data, all of which are crucial to functional safety and the driving experience.</p>
<p>AI-based cybersecurity can help monitor in-car and network activities in real time, allowing for rapid response to threats. AI can be deployed to secure and authenticate over-the-air updates to prevent tampering and ensure the authenticity of software updates. AI-driven encryption can protect data transmitted over WiFi, Bluetooth and RFID connections. AI can also probe vehicle systems for vulnerabilities and take remedial steps.</p>
<p>Ranging from AI-powered access control to unlock and start vehicles to detecting deviations in sensor performance and patching security vulnerabilities, AI will play a crucial role in the safe development and deployment of autonomous vehicles on our roads.</p>
<h2><strong>Keeping Operations Secure and Customers Happy With AI Cybersecurity </strong></h2>
<p>By deploying AI to protect valuable data and digital operations, industries can focus their resources on innovating better products, improving customer experiences and creating new business value.</p>
<p>NVIDIA offers a number of tools and frameworks to help enterprises swiftly adjust to the evolving cyber risk environment. The NVIDIA Morpheus cybersecurity framework provides developers and software vendors with optimized, easy-to-use tools to build solutions that can proactively detect and mitigate threats while drastically reducing the cost of cyber defense operations. To help defend <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/ai-workflows/spear-phishing/">against phishing attempts</a>, the NVIDIA spear phishing detection AI workflow uses NVIDIA Morpheus and synthetic training data created with the NVIDIA NeMo generative AI framework to flag and halt inbox threats.</p>
<p>The Morpheus SDK also enables <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/ai-workflows/digital-fingerprinting/">digital fingerprinting</a> to collect and analyze behavior characteristics for every user, service, account and machine across a network to identify atypical behavior and alert network operators. With the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/networking/doca">NVIDIA DOCA</a> software framework, developers can create software-defined, DPU-accelerated services, while leveraging zero trust to build more secure applications.</p>
<p>AI-based cybersecurity empowers developers across industries to build solutions that can identify, capture and act on threats and anomalies to ensure business continuity and uninterrupted service, keeping operations safe and customers happy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[AI technologies are having a massive impact across industries, including media and entertainment, automotive, customer service and more.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>AI technologies are having a massive impact across industries, including media and entertainment, automotive, customer service and more. For game developers, these advances are paving the way for creating more realistic and immersive in-game experiences.</p>
<p>From creating lifelike characters that convey emotions to transforming simple text into captivating imagery, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foundation models</a> are becoming essential in accelerating developer workflows while reducing overall costs. These powerful AI models have unlocked a realm of possibilities, empowering designers and game developers to build higher-quality gaming experiences.</p>
<h2><b>What Are Foundation Models?</b></h2>
<p>A foundation model is a neural network that’s trained on massive amounts of data — and then adapted to tackle a wide variety of tasks. They’re capable of enabling a range of general tasks, such as text, image and audio generation. Over the last year, the popularity and use of foundation models has rapidly increased, with hundreds now available.</p>
<p>For example, GPT-4 is a large multimodal model developed by OpenAI that can generate human-like text based on context and past conversations. Another, DALL-E 3, can create realistic images and artwork from a description written in natural language.</p>
<p>Powerful foundation models like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA NeMo</a> and Edify model in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/picasso/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Picasso</a> make it easy for companies and developers to inject AI into their existing workflows. For example, using the NVIDIA NeMo framework, organizations can quickly train, customize and deploy <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> models at scale. And using NVIDIA Picasso, teams can fine-tune pretrained Edify models with their own enterprise data to build custom products and services for generative AI images, videos, 3D assets, texture materials and 360 HDRi.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA NeMo Service | Boosting Enterprise Productivity with Customized Generative AI Models" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J86qoG6zG58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>How Are Foundation Models Built?</b></h2>
<p>Foundation models can be used as a base for AI systems that can perform multiple tasks. Organizations can easily and quickly use a large amount of unlabeled data to create their own foundation models.</p>
<p>The dataset should be as large and diverse as possible, as too little data or poor-quality data can lead to inaccuracies — sometimes called hallucinations — or cause finer details to go missing in generated outputs.</p>
<p>Next, the dataset must be prepared. This includes cleaning the data, removing errors and formatting it in such a way that the model can understand it. Bias is a pervasive issue when preparing a dataset, so it’s important to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3597307" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measure, reduce and tackle</a> these inconsistencies and inaccuracies.</p>
<p>Training a foundational model can be time-consuming, especially given the size of the model and the amount of data required. Hardware like NVIDIA A100 or H100 Tensor Core GPUs, along with high-performance data systems like the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, can accelerate training. For example, ChatGPT-3 was trained on over 1,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs over about 34 days.</p>

<p>After ‌training, the foundation model is evaluated on quality, diversity and speed. There are <a href="https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-model-evaluation/#5-commonly-used-performance-evaluation-methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several methods</a> for evaluating performance, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools and frameworks that quantify how well the model predicts a sample of text</li>
<li>Metrics that compare generated outputs with one or more references and measure the similarities between them</li>
<li>Human evaluators who assess the quality of the generated output on various criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the model passes the relevant tests and evaluations, it can then be deployed for production.</p>
<h2><b>Exploring Foundation Models in Games</b></h2>
<p>Pretrained foundation models can be leveraged by middleware, tools and game developers both during production and at run-time. To train a base model, resources and time are necessary — alongside a certain level of expertise. Currently, many developers within the gaming industry are exploring off-the-shelf models, but need custom solutions that fit their specific use cases. They need models that are trained on commercially safe data and optimized for real-time performance — without exorbitant costs of deployment. The difficulty of meeting these requirements has slowed adoption of foundation models.</p>
<p>However, innovation within the generative AI space is swift, and once major hurdles are addressed, developers of all sizes — from startups to AAA studios — will use foundation models to gain new efficiencies in game development and accelerate content creation. Additionally, these models can help create completely new gameplay experiences.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA ACE Enhanced with Dynamic Responses for Virtual Characters" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lf0z8Z3OQvM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The top industry use cases are centered around intelligent agents and AI-powered animation and asset creation. For example, many creators today are exploring models for creating intelligent non-playable characters, or NPCs.</p>
<p>Custom LLMs fine-tuned with the lingo and lore of specific games can generate human-like text, understand context and respond to prompts in a coherent manner. They’re designed to learn patterns and language structures and understand game state changes — evolving and progressing alongside the player in the game.</p>
<p>As NPCs become increasingly dynamic,real-time animation and audio that sync with their responses will be needed. Developers are using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/riva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Riva</a> to create expressive character voices using speech and translation AI. And designers are tapping <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Audio2Face</a> for AI-powered facial animations.</p>
<p>Foundation models are also being used for asset and animation generation. Asset creation during the pre-production and production phases of game development can be time-consuming, tedious and expensive.</p>
<p>With state-of-the-art diffusion models, developers can iterate more quickly, freeing up time to spend on the most important aspects of the content pipeline, such as developing higher-quality assets and iterating. The ability to fine-tune these models from a studio’s own repository of data ensures the outputs generated are similar to the art styles and designs of their previous games.</p>
<p>Foundation models are readily available, and the gaming industry is only in the beginning phases of understanding their full capabilities. Various solutions have been built for real-time experiences, but the use cases are limited. Fortunately, developers can easily access models and microservices through cloud APIs today and explore how AI can affect their games and scale their solutions to more customers and devices than ever before.</p>
<h2><b>The Future of Foundation Models in Gaming</b><b><br />
</b></h2>
<p>Foundation models are poised to help developers realize the future of gaming. Diffusion models and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language models</a> are becoming much more lightweight as developers look to run them natively on a range of hardware power profiles, including PCs, consoles and mobile devices.</p>
<p>The accuracy and quality of these models will only continue to improve as developers look to generate high-quality assets that need little to no touching up before being dropped into an AAA gaming experience.</p>
<p>Foundation models will also be used in areas that have been challenging for developers to overcome with traditional technology. For example, autonomous agents can help analyze and detect world space during game development, which will accelerate processes for quality assurance.</p>
<p>The rise of multimodal foundation models, which can ingest a mix of text, image, audio and other inputs simultaneously, will further enhance player interactions with intelligent NPCs and other game systems. Also, developers can use additional input types to improve creativity and enhance the quality of generated assets during production.</p>
<p>Multimodal models also show great promise in improving the animation of real-time characters, one of the most time-intensive and expensive processes of game development. They may be able to help make characters’ locomotion identical to real-life actors, infuse style and feel from a range of inputs, and ease the rigging process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The home of the first industrial revolution just made a massive investment in the next one.</p>
<p>The U.K. government has announced it will spend £225 million ($273 million) to build one of the world’s fastest AI supercomputers.</p>
<p>Called Isambard-AI, it’s the latest in a series of systems named after a legendary 19th century British engineer and hosted by the University of Bristol. When fully installed next year, it will pack 5,448 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/">NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips</a> to deliver a whopping 21 exaflops of AI performance for researchers across the country and beyond.</p>
<p>The announcement was made at the AI Safety Summit, a gathering of over 100 global government and technology leaders, held in Bletchley Park, the site of the world’s first digital programmable computer, which reflected the work of innovators like Alan Turing, considered the father of AI.</p>
<p>AI “will bring a transformation as far-reaching as the industrial revolution, the coming of electricity or the birth of the internet,” said British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a speech last week about the event, designed to catalyze international collaboration.</p>
<h2><b>Propelling the Modern Economy</b></h2>
<p>Like one of Isambard Brunel’s creations — the first propeller-driven, ocean-going iron ship — the AI technology running on his namesake is already driving countries forward.</p>
<p>AI contributes more than £3.7 billion to the U.K. economy and employs more than 50,000 people, said Michelle Donelan, the nation’s Science, Innovation and Technology Secretary, in an earlier announcement about the system.</p>
<p>The investment in the so-called AI Research Resource in Bristol “will catalyze scientific discovery and keep the U.K. at the forefront of AI development,” she said.</p>
<p>Like AI itself, the system will be used across a wide range of organizations tapping the potential of machine learning to advance robotics, data analytics, drug discovery, climate research and more.</p>
<p>“Isambard-AI represents a huge leap forward for AI computational power in the U.K.,” said Simon McIntosh-Smith, a Bristol professor and director of the Isambard National Research Facility. “Today, Isambard-AI would rank within the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world and, when in operation later in 2024, it will be one of the most powerful AI systems for open science anywhere.”</p>
<h2><b>The Next Manufacturing Revolution</b></h2>
<p>Like the industrial revolution, AI promises advances in manufacturing. That’s one reason why Isambard-AI will be based at the National Composites Centre (NCC, pictured above) in the Bristol and Bath Science Park, one of the country’s seven manufacturing research centers.</p>
<p>The U.K.’s Frontier AI Taskforce, a research group leading a global effort on how frontier AI can be safely developed, will also be a major user of the system.</p>
<p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which is building Isambard-AI, is also collaborating with the University of Bristol on energy-efficiency plans that support net-zero carbon targets mandated by the British government.</p>
<h2><b>Energy-Efficient HPC</b></h2>
<p>A second system coming next year to the NCC will show Arm’s energy efficiency for non-accelerated high performance computing workloads.</p>
<p>Isambard-3 will deliver an estimated 2.7 petaflops of FP64 peak performance and consume less than 270 kilowatts of power, ranking it among the world’s three greenest non-accelerated supercomputers. That’s because the system — part of a research alliance among universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter — will sport 384 Arm-based <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-cpu-superchip/">NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchips</a> to power medical and scientific research.</p>
<p>“Isambard-3’s application performance efficiency of up to 6x its predecessor, which rivals many of the 50 fastest TOP500 systems, will provide scientists with a revolutionary new supercomputing platform to advance groundbreaking research,” said Bristol’s McIntosh-Smith, when the system was <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-grace-drives-wave-of-new-energy-efficient-arm-supercomputers">announced</a> in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">Generative AI</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">large language models</a> are stirring change across industries — but according to NVIDIA Senior Product Manager of Developer Marketing Annamalai Chockalingam, “we’re still in the early innings.”</p>
<p>In the latest episode of NVIDIA’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/ai-podcast/">AI Podcast</a>, host Noah Kravitz spoke with Chockalingam about LLMs: what they are, their current state and their future potential.</p>
<p>Describing LLMs as a “subset of the larger generative AI movement,” Chockalingam says they can do five things with language: generate, summarize, translate, instruct or chat. With a combination of “these modalities and actions, you can build applications” to solve any problem, he said.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1651053912%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-5uJAR5koNPP&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Enterprises are tapping LLMs to drive innovation, develop new customer experiences and gain a competitive advantage, he said. They’re also exploring what safe deployment of those models looks like, aiming to achieve responsible development, trustworthiness and repeatability.</p>
<p>New techniques like retrieval augmented generation could boost LLM development. RAG involves feeding models with up-to-date data sources or third-party APIs to achieve “more appropriate responses,” Chockalingam said — granting them current context so that they can “generate better” answers.</p>
<p>Chockalingam encourages those interested in LLMs to “get your hands dirty and get started” — whether that means using popular applications like ChatGPT or playing with pretrained models in the <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/?filters=&amp;orderBy=weightPopularDESC&amp;query=">NVIDIA NGC catalog</a>.NVIDIA offers a full-stack computing platform for developers and enterprises experimenting with LLMs, with an ecosystem of over 4 million developers and 1,600 generative AI organizations. To learn more, register for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/llm-developer-day/#:~:text=LLM%20Developer%20Day%20%7C%20November%2017%2C%202023%20%7C%20NVIDIA">LLM Developer Day</a> on Nov. 17 to hear from NVIDIA experts about how best to develop applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>In the world’s largest solar race car event of the year, the University of New South Wales Sunswift Racing team is having its day in the sun.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://worldsolarchallenge.org/">World Solar Challenge</a>, which first began some 35 years ago, attracts academic participants from across the globe. This year’s event drew nearly 100 competitors.</p>
<p>The race runs nearly 1,900 miles over the course of about four days and pits challengers in a battle not for speed but for greatest energy efficiency.</p>
<p>UNSW Sydney won the energy efficiency competition and crossed the finish line first, taking the Cruiser Cup with its Sunswift 7 vehicle, which utilizes <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/">NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX</a> for energy optimization. It was also the only competitor to race with 4 people on board and a remote mission control team.</p>
<p>“It’s a completely different proposition to say we can use the least amount of energy and arrive in Adelaide before anybody else, but crossing the line first is just about bragging rights,” said Richard Hopkins, project manager at Sunswift and a UNSW professor. Hopkins previously managed Formula 1 race teams in the U.K.</p>
<p>Race organizers bill the event, which cuts across the entire Australian continent on public roads — from Darwin in the north to Adelaide in the south — as the “world’s greatest innovation and engineering challenge contributing to a more sustainable mobility future.” It’s also become a launchpad for students pursuing career paths in the electric vehicle industry.</p>
<p>Like many of the competitors, UNSW is coming back after a three-year hiatus from the race due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making this year’s competition highly anticipated.</p>
<p>“Every single team member needs to understand what they’re doing and what their role is on the team and perform at the very best during those five-and-a-half days,” said Hopkins. “It is exhausting.”</p>
<h2><b>All In on Energy Efficiency  </b></h2>
<p>The race allows participants to start with a fully charged battery and to charge when the vehicles stop for the night at two locations. The remaining energy used, some 90%, comes from the sun and the vehicles’ solar panels.</p>
<p>UNSW’s seventh-generation Sunswift 7 runs algorithms to optimize for energy efficiency, essentially shutting down all nonessential computing to maximize battery life.</p>
<p>The solar electric vehicle relies on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a> AI to give it an edge across its roughly 100 automotive monitoring and power management systems.</p>
<p>It can also factor in whether it should drive faster or slower based on weather forecasts. For instance, the car will urge the driver to go faster if it’s going to rain later in the day when conditions would force the car to slow down.</p>
<p>The Sunswift 7 vehicle was designed to mostly drive in a straight line from Darwin to Adelaide, and the object is to use the least amount of power outside of that mission, said Hopkins.</p>
<p>“Sunswift 7 late last year was featured in the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> for being the fastest electric vehicle for over 1,000 kilometers on a single charge of battery,” he said.</p>

<h2><b>Jetson-Based Racers for Learning</b></h2>
<p>The UNSW team created nearly 60 design iterations to improve on the aerodynamics of the vehicle. They used computational fluid dynamics modeling and ran simulations to analyze each version.</p>
<p>“We didn’t ever put the car through a physical wind tunnel,” said Hopkins.</p>
<p>The technical team has been working on a model to determine what speed the vehicle should be driven at for maximum energy conservation. “They’re working on taking in as many parameters as you can, given it’s really hard to get good driving data,” said Josh Bramley, technology manager at Sunswift Racing.</p>
<p>Sunswift 7 is running on the Robot Operating System (ROS) suite of software and relies on its NVIDIA Jetson module to process all the input from the sensors for analytics, which can be monitored by the remote pit crew back on campus at UNSW.</p>
<p>Jetson is used for all the control systems on the car, so everything from the accelerator pedal, wheel sensors, solar current sensors and more are processed on it for data to analyze for ways AI might help, said Bramley. The next version of the vehicle is expected to pack more AI, he added.</p>
<p>“A lot of the AI and computer vision will be coming for Sunswift 8 in the next solar challenge,” said Bramley.</p>
<p>More than 100 students are getting course credit for the Sunswift Racing team work, and many are interested in pursuing careers in electric vehicles, said Hopkins.</p>
<p>Past World Solar Challenge contestants have gone on to work at Tesla, SpaceX and Zipline.</p>

<p>The latest Halloween-themed Studio Standouts video features ghouls, creepy monsters, haunted hospitals, dimly lit homes and is not for the faint-of-heart.</p>
<h2><b>Remarkable Ray Reconstruction</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS 3.5</a> — featuring Ray Reconstruction — enhances ray-traced image quality on GeForce RTX GPUs by replacing hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 | New Ray Reconstruction Enhances Ray Tracing with AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGKCrcNsVzo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Previewing content in the viewport, even with high-end hardware, can sometimes offer less than ideal image quality, as traditional denoisers require hand-tuning for every scene.</p>
<p>With DLSS 3.5, the AI neural network recognizes a wide variety of scenes, producing high-quality preview images and drastically reducing time spent rendering scenes.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Omniverse and the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/usd-composer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USD Composer</a> app — featuring the Omniverse RTX Renderer — specialize in real-time preview modes, offering ray-tracing inference and higher-quality previews while building and iterating.</p>
<p>The feature can be enabled by opening “Render Settings” under “Ray Tracing,” opening the “Direct Lighting” tab and ensuring “New Denoiser (experimental)” is turned on.</p>
<h2><b>The ‘Haunted Sanctuary’</b> <b>Returns</b></h2>
<p>Sabour Amirazodi’s “home-made” installation, <i>Haunted Sanctuary</i>, has become an annual tradition, much to the delight of his neighbors.</p>

<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>“In the last few years, I’ve rendered 32,862 frames of 5K animation out of the Octane Render Engine. The loop has now become 21 minutes long, and the musical show is another 28 minutes!” — Sabour Amirazodi</p>
</div>
<p>Building a virtual scene onto a physical object requires projection mapping, so Amirazodi used NVIDIA GPU-accelerated MadMapper software and its structured light-scan feature to map custom visuals onto his house. He achieved this by connecting a DSLR camera to his mobile workstation, which was powered by an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a5000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPU</a>.</p>
<p>He used the camera to shoot a series of lines and capture photos. Then, he translated to the projector’s point of view an image on which to base a 3D model. Basic camera-matching tools found in Cinema 4D helped recreate the scene. Afterward, Amirazodi applied various mapping and perspective correction edits.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67802" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67802" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/studio-sabour-amirazodi-wk81-cinema-4d-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67802" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/studio-sabour-amirazodi-wk81-cinema-4d-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/studio-sabour-amirazodi-wk81-cinema-4d-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/studio-sabour-amirazodi-wk81-cinema-4d-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/studio-sabour-amirazodi-wk81-cinema-4d-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/studio-sabour-amirazodi-wk81-cinema-4d-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/studio-sabour-amirazodi-wk81-cinema-4d-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/studio-sabour-amirazodi-wk81-cinema-4d-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/studio-sabour-amirazodi-wk81-cinema-4d-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67802" class="wp-caption-text">Projection mapping requires matching the virtual world with real-world specifications, done in Cinema 4D.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, Amirazodi animated and rigged the characters. GPU acceleration in the viewport enabled smooth interactivity with complex 3D models.</p>
<p>“I like having a choice between several third-party NVIDIA GPU-accelerated 3D renderers, such as V-Ray, OctaneRender and Redshift in Cinema 4D,” noted Amirazodi.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>“I switched to NVIDIA graphics cards in 2017. GPUs are the only way to go for serious creators.” — Sabour Amirazodi</p>
</div>
<p>Amirazodi then spent hours on his <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a6000/">RTX 6000</a> workstation creating and rendering out all the animations, assembling them in Adobe After Effects and compositing them on the scanned canvas in MadMapper. There, he crafted individual scenes to render out as chunks and assembled them in Adobe Premiere Pro. Remarkably, he repeated this workflow for every projector.</p>
<p>Once satisfied with the sequences, Amirazodi encoded everything using Adobe Media Encoder and loaded them onto BrightSign digital players — all networked to run the show synchronously.</p>
<p>Amirazodi used the advantages of GPU acceleration to streamline his workflow — saving him countless hours. “After Effects has numerous plug-ins that are GPU-accelerated — plus, Adobe Premiere Pro and Media Encoder use the new dual encoders found in the Ada generation of NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs, cutting my export times in half,” he said.</p>

<p>Amirazodi’s careful efforts are all in the Halloween spirit — creating a hauntingly memorable experience for his community.</p>
<p>“The hard work and long nights all become worth it when I see the smile on my kids’ faces and all the joy it brings to the entire neighborhood,” he reflected.</p>
