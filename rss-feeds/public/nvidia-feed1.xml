										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA’s AI platform raised the bar for AI training and high performance computing in the latest <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/mlperf-benchmarks/">MLPerf</a> industry benchmarks.</p>
<p>Among many new records and milestones, one in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> stands out: <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-dgx-h100-systems-worlds-most-advanced-enterprise-ai-infrastructure">NVIDIA Eos</a> — an AI supercomputer powered by a whopping 10,752 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/">NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand</a> networking — completed a training benchmark based on a GPT-3 model with 175 billion parameters trained on one billion tokens in just 3.9 minutes.</p>
<p>That’s a nearly 3x gain from 10.9 minutes, the record NVIDIA set when the test <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/06/27/generative-ai-debut-mlperf/">was introduced</a> less than six months ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights.jpg"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67961" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-672x422.jpg" alt="NVIDIA H100 training results over time on MLPerf benchmarks" width="672" height="422" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-672x422.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-400x251.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-768x483.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-716x450.jpg 716w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-342x215.jpg 342w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-159x100.jpg 159w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>The benchmark uses a portion of the full GPT-3 data set behind the popular ChatGPT service that, by extrapolation, Eos could now train in just eight days, 73x faster than a prior state-of-the-art system using 512 A100 GPUs.</p>
<p>The acceleration in training time reduces costs, saves energy and speeds time-to-market. It’s heavy lifting that makes large language models widely available so every business can adopt them with tools like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, a framework for customizing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">LLMs</a>.</p>
<p>In a new generative AI test ‌this round, 1,024 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/hopper-architecture/">NVIDIA Hopper architecture GPUs</a> completed a training benchmark based on the Stable Diffusion text-to-image model in 2.5 minutes, setting a high bar on this new workload.</p>
<p>By adopting these two tests, MLPerf reinforces its leadership as the industry standard for measuring AI performance, since generative AI is the most transformative technology of our time.</p>
<h2><b>System Scaling Soars</b></h2>
<p>The latest results were due in part to the use of the most accelerators ever applied to an MLPerf benchmark. The 10,752 H100 GPUs far surpassed the scaling in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/06/27/generative-ai-debut-mlperf/">AI training</a> in June, when NVIDIA used 3,584 Hopper GPUs.</p>
<p>The 3x scaling in GPU numbers delivered a 2.8x scaling in performance, a 93% efficiency rate thanks in part to software optimizations.</p>
<p>Efficient scaling is a key requirement in generative AI because LLMs are growing by <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/09/29/huangs-law-dally-hot-chips/">an order of magnitude every year</a>. The latest results show NVIDIA’s ability to meet this unprecedented challenge for even the world’s largest data centers.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2-Near-linear-scaling-of-NV-H100s-on-MLPerf-training-benchmark.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67964" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2-Near-linear-scaling-of-NV-H100s-on-MLPerf-training-benchmark-672x420.jpg" alt="Chart of near linear scaling of H100 GPUs on MLPerf training" width="672" height="420" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2-Near-linear-scaling-of-NV-H100s-on-MLPerf-training-benchmark-672x420.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2-Near-linear-scaling-of-NV-H100s-on-MLPerf-training-benchmark-400x250.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2-Near-linear-scaling-of-NV-H100s-on-MLPerf-training-benchmark-768x480.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2-Near-linear-scaling-of-NV-H100s-on-MLPerf-training-benchmark-720x450.jpg 720w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2-Near-linear-scaling-of-NV-H100s-on-MLPerf-training-benchmark-344x215.jpg 344w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2-Near-linear-scaling-of-NV-H100s-on-MLPerf-training-benchmark-160x100.jpg 160w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2-Near-linear-scaling-of-NV-H100s-on-MLPerf-training-benchmark.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>The achievement is thanks to a full-stack platform of innovations in accelerators, systems and software that both Eos and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nd-h100-v5-series">Microsoft Azure</a> used in the latest round.</p>
<p>Eos and Azure both employed 10,752 H100 GPUs in separate submissions. They achieved within 2% of the same performance, demonstrating the efficiency of NVIDIA AI in data center and public-cloud deployments.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67967" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-672x378.jpg" alt="Chart of record Azure scaling in MLPerf training" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-800x450.jpg 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-382x215.jpg 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>NVIDIA relies on Eos for a wide array of critical jobs. It helps advance initiatives like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS</a>, AI-powered software for state-of-the-art computer graphics and NVIDIA Research projects like <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/10/30/llm-semiconductors-chip-nemo/">ChipNeMo</a>, generative AI tools that help design next-generation GPUs.</p>
<h2><b>Advances Across Workloads</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA set several new records in this round in addition to making advances in generative AI.</p>
<p>For example, H100 GPUs were 1.6x faster than the prior-round training recommender models widely employed to help users find what they’re looking for online. Performance was up 1.8x on RetinaNet, a computer vision model.</p>
<p>These increases came from a combination of advances in software and scaled-up hardware.</p>
<p>NVIDIA was once again the only company to run all MLPerf tests. H100 GPUs demonstrated the fastest performance and the greatest scaling in each of the nine benchmarks.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67970" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-672x366.jpg" alt="List of six new NVIDIA records in MLPerf training" width="672" height="366" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-672x366.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-400x218.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-768x418.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-826x450.jpg 826w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-395x215.jpg 395w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-184x100.jpg 184w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-1280x697.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training.jpg 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>Speedups translate to faster time to market, lower costs and energy savings for users training massive LLMs or customizing them with frameworks like NeMo for the specific needs of their business.</p>
<p>Eleven systems makers used the NVIDIA AI platform in their submissions this round, including ASUS, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Lenovo, QCT and Supermicro.</p>
<p>NVIDIA partners participate in MLPerf because they know it’s a valuable tool for customers evaluating AI platforms and vendors.</p>
<h2><b>HPC Benchmarks Expand</b></h2>
<p>In MLPerf HPC, a separate benchmark for AI-assisted simulations on supercomputers, H100 GPUs delivered up to twice the performance of NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/11/17/mlperf-hpc-ai/">the last HPC round</a>. The results showed up to 16x gains since the first MLPerf HPC round in 2019.</p>
<p>The benchmark included a new test that trains OpenFold, a model that predicts the 3D structure of a protein from its sequence of amino acids. OpenFold can do in minutes vital work for healthcare that used to take researchers weeks or months.</p>
<p>Understanding a protein’s structure is key to finding effective drugs fast because most drugs act on proteins, the cellular machinery that helps control many biological processes.</p>
<p>In the MLPerf HPC test, H100 GPUs trained OpenFold in 7.5 minutes.  The OpenFold test is a representative part of the entire AlphaFold training process that two years ago took 11 days using 128 accelerators.</p>
<p>A version of the OpenFold model and the software NVIDIA used to train it will be available soon in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a>, a generative AI platform for drug discovery.</p>
<p>Several partners made submissions on the NVIDIA AI platform in this round. They included Dell Technologies and supercomputing centers at Clemson University, the Texas Advanced Computing Center and — with assistance from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) — Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</p>
<h2><b>Benchmarks With Broad Backing</b></h2>
<p>Since its inception in May 2018, the MLPerf benchmarks have enjoyed broad backing from both industry and academia. Organizations that support them include Amazon, Arm, Baidu, Google, Harvard, HPE, Intel, Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Stanford University and the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>MLPerf tests are transparent and objective, so users can rely on the results to make informed buying decisions.</p>
<p>All the software NVIDIA used is available from the MLPerf repository, so all developers can get the same world-class results. These software optimizations get continuously folded into containers available on <a href="https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog">NGC</a>, NVIDIA’s software hub for GPU applications.</p>

It can produce 124-130 different possible diagnoses and flag key findings to aid radiologists in their final diagnosis. Currently, Annalise.ai works for chest X-rays and brain CT scans, with more on the way.</p>

<p>While an AI designed for categorizing traffic lights, for example, doesn’t need perfection, medical tools must be highly accurate — any oversight could be fatal. To overcome this challenge, annalise.ai was trained on millions of meticulously annotated images — some were annotated three to five times over before being used for training.</p>
<p>Harrison.ai is also developing Franklin.ai, a sibling AI tool aimed at accelerating and improving the accuracy of histopathology diagnosis — in which a clinician performs a biopsy and inspects the tissue for the presence of cancerous cells. Similarly to Annalise.ai, Franklin.ai flags critical findings to assist pathologists in speeding and increasing the accuracy of diagnoses.</p>
<p>Ethical concerns about AI use are ever rising, but for Tran, the concern is less about whether it’s ethical to use AI for medical diagnosis but “actually the converse: Is it ethical to <i>not</i> use AI for medical diagnosis,” especially if “humans using those AI systems simply pick up more misdiagnosis, pick up more cancer and conditions?”</p>
<p>Tran also talked about the future of AI systems and suggested that the focus is dual: first, focus on improving preexisting systems and then think of new cutting-edge solutions.</p>
<p>And for those looking to break into careers in AI and healthcare, Tran says that the “first step is to decide upfront what problems you’re willing to spend a huge part of your time solving first, before the AI part,” emphasizing that the “first thing is actually to fall in love with some problem.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of our weekly </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/in-the-nvidia-studio/"><i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/"><i>NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> technology improves creative workflows. We’re also deep-diving on new </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/"><i>GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU</i></a><i> features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.</i></p>
<p>Taiwanese artist Steven Tung creates captivating 2D and 3D digital art that explores sci-fi, minimalism and realism and pushes artistic boundaries.</p>
<p>This week <i>In the NVIDIA Studio,</i> Tung shares the inspiration and creative workflow behind his whimsical animation, <i>The Given Fish</i>.</p>
<p>Professional-grade technology, which was once available only at select special effects studios, is becoming increasingly accessible.</p>
<p>“Visual production capabilities continue to skyrocket, generating a growing demand for better computer hardware among the general public,” Tung said. “The evolving synergy between art and technology can spark endless possibilities for creators.”</p>
<p>Tung uses an <a href="https://www.msi.com/Desktop/MEG-Trident-X2-13th">MSI MEG Trident X2 desktop</a>, powered by GeForce RTX 4090 graphics, to accelerate his creative workflow.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67876" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67876" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67876" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67876" class="wp-caption-text">The MSI MEG Trident X2 desktop, powered by GeForce RTX 4090 graphics.</figcaption></figure>
<p>“The enhanced speed and performance expedites various processes, such as updating material textures in Adobe Substance 3D Painter and rendering in Blender,” said Tung. “The necessary specifications and requirements align, enabling maximum creativity without limitations.”</p>
<h2><b>Exquisite Visuals Made E-fish-ciently</b></h2>
<p>Tung’s 3D animation, <i>The Given Fish</i>, may look simple at first glance — but it’s surprisingly complex.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>“GeForce RTX GPUs are indispensable hardware for 3D rendering tasks. Faster speeds bring significant benefits in production efficiency and time saved.” — Steven Tung</p>
</div>
<p>In the creative world behind the animation, the stone fish depicted can be consumed by people. The concept is that once taken out of the aquarium, the stone fish transforms into a real, living one.</p>
<p>“I have a strong desire to have an aquarium at home, but it’s not practical,” said Tung. “The next best thing is to turn that emotion into art.”</p>
<p>Tung began by creating concept sketches in Adobe Photoshop, where he had access to over 30 GPU-accelerated features that could help modify and adjust his canvas and maximize his efficiency.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67879" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67879" style="width: 453px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67879" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w-453x500.png" alt="" width="453" height="500" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w-453x500.png 453w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w-363x400.png 363w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w-768x847.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w-408x450.png 408w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w-195x215.png 195w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w-91x100.png 91w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67879" class="wp-caption-text">Concept art for “The Given Fish.”</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, Tung jumped from 2D to 3D with ZBrush. He first built a basic model and then refined critical details with custom brushes — adding greater depth and dimension with authentic, hand-sculpted textures.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67882" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67882" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67882" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67882" class="wp-caption-text">Advanced sculpting in ZBrush.</figcaption></figure>
<p>He then used the UV unwrapping feature in RizomUV to ensure that his models were properly unwrapped and ready for texture application.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67885" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67885" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67885" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w-672x361.png" alt="" width="672" height="361" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w-672x361.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w-400x215.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w-768x412.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w-838x450.png 838w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w-401x215.png 401w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w-186x100.png 186w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67885" class="wp-caption-text">UV unwrapping feature in RizomUV.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Tung imported the models into Adobe 3D Substance Painter, where he meticulously painted textures, blended materials and used the built-in library to achieve lifelike stone textures. RTX-accelerated light and ambient occlusion baking optimized his assets in seconds.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67888" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67888" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67888" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67888" class="wp-caption-text">Applying textures in Adobe Substance 3D Painter.</figcaption></figure>
<p>To bring all the elements together, Tung imported the models and materials into Blender. He set up texture channels, assigned texture files and assembled the models so that they would be true to the compositions outlined in the initial sketch.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67891" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67891" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67891" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67891" class="wp-caption-text">Achieving realistic stone textures in Adobe 3D Substance Painter.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, Tung used Blender Cycles to light and render the scene.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Embodying the convergence of AI and academia, the University of Florida Friday inaugurated the Malachowsky Hall for Data Science &amp; Information Technology.</p>
<p>The sleek, seven-story building is poised to play a pivotal role in UF’s ongoing efforts to harness the transformative power of AI, reaffirming its stature as one of the nation’s leading public universities.</p>
<p>Evoking Apple co-founder Steve Jobs’ iconic description of a personal computer, NVIDIA’s founder and CEO Jensen Huang described Malachowsky Hall — named for NVIDIA co-founder Chris Malachowsky — and the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/07/21/university-of-florida-nvidia-ai-supercomputer/">HiPerGator AI supercomputer</a> it hosts as a “starship for knowledge discovery.”</p>
<p>“Steve Jobs called (the PC) ‘the bicycle of the mind,’ a device that propels our thoughts further and faster,” Huang said.</p>
<p>“What Chris Malachowsky has gifted this institution is nothing short of the ‘starship of the mind’ — a vehicle that promises to take our intellect to uncharted territories,” Huang said.</p>
<p>The inauguration of the 260,000-square-foot structure marks a milestone in the partnership between UF alum Malachowsky, NVIDIA and the state of Florida — a collaboration that has propelled UF to the forefront of AI innovation.</p>
<p>Malachowsky and NVIDIA both made major contributions toward its construction, bolstered by a $110 million investment from the state of Florida.</p>

<p>Following the opening, Huang and UF’s new president, Ben Sasse, met to discuss the impact of AI and data science across UF and beyond for students just starting their careers.</p>
<p>Sasse underscored the importance of adaptability in a rapidly changing world, telling the audience: “work in lots and lots of different organizations … because lifelong work in any one, not just firm, but any one industry is going to end in our lives. You’re ultimately going to have to figure out how to reinvent yourselves at 30, 35, 40 and 45.”</p>
<p>Huang offered students very different advice, recalling how he met his wife, Lori, who was in the audience, as an undergraduate. “Have a good pickup line … do you want to know the pickup line?” Huang asked, pausing a beat. “You want to see my homework?”</p>
<p>The spirit of Sasse and Huang’s adaptable approach to career and personal development is embodied in Malachowsky Hall, designed to bring together people from academia and industry, research and government.</p>
<p>Packed with innovative collaboration spaces and labs, the hall features a spacious 400-seat auditorium, dedicated high-performance computing study spaces and a rooftop terrace that unveils panoramic campus vistas.</p>
<p>Sustainability is woven into its design, highlighted by energy-efficient systems and rainwater harvesting facilities.</p>
<p>Malachowsky Hall will serve as a conduit to bring the on-campus advances in AI to Florida’s thriving economy, which continues to outpace the nation in jobs and GDP growth.</p>

<p>UF’s efforts to bring AI and academia together, catalyzed by support from Malachowsky and NVIDIA, go far beyond Malachowsky Hall.</p>
<p>In 2020, UF announced that Malachowsky and NVIDIA together donated $50 million toward HiPerGator, one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the country.</p>
<p>With additional state support, UF recently added more than 110 AI faculty members to the 300 already engaged in AI teaching and research.</p>
<p>As a result, UF extended AI-focused courses, workshops and projects across the university, enabling its 55,000 students to delve into AI and its interdisciplinary applications.</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s ribbon-cutting will open exciting new opportunities for the university, its students and the state of Florida to realize the potential of AI innovations across sectors.</p>
<p>Huang likened pursuing knowledge through AI to embarking on a “starship.” “You’ve got to go as far as you can,” he urged students.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The world’s <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring23-S51404/">5 billion</a> internet users and nearly 54 billion devices generate <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US49346123&amp;pageType=PRINTFRIENDLY">3.4 petabytes of data per second</a>, according to IDC. As digitalization accelerates, enterprise IT teams are under greater pressure to identify and block incoming cyber threats to ensure business operations and services are not interrupted — and AI-based cybersecurity provides a reliable way to do so.</p>
<p>Few industries appear immune to cyber threats. This year alone, international hotel chains, financial institutions, Fortune 100 retailers, air traffic-control systems and the U.S. government have all reported threats and intrusions.</p>
<p>Whether from insider error, cybercriminals, hacktivists or other threats, risks in the cyber landscape can damage an enterprise’s reputation and bottom line. A breach can paralyze operations, jeopardize proprietary and customer data, result in regulatory fines and destroy customer trust.</p>
<p>Using AI and accelerated computing, businesses can reduce the time and operational expenses required to detect and block cyber threats while freeing up resources to focus on core business value operations and revenue-generating activities.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at how industries are applying AI techniques to safeguard data, enable faster threat detection and mitigate attacks to ensure the consistent delivery of service to customers and partners.</p>
<h2><strong>Public Sector: Protecting Physical Security, Energy Security and Citizen Services</strong></h2>
<p>AI-powered analytics and automation tools are helping government agencies provide citizens with instant access to information and services, make data-driven decisions, model climate change, manage natural disasters, and more. But <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/public-sector/">public entities</a> managing digital tools and infrastructure face a complex cyber risk environment that includes regulatory compliance requirements, public scrutiny, large interconnected networks and the need to protect sensitive data and high-value targets.</p>
<p>Adversary nation-states may initiate cyberattacks to disrupt networks, steal intellectual property or swipe classified government documents. Internal misuse of digital tools and infrastructure combined with sophisticated external espionage places public organizations at high risk of data breach. Espionage actors have also been known to recruit inside help, with <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">16% of public administration breaches</a> showing evidence of collusion. To protect critical infrastructure, citizen data, public records and other sensitive information, federal organizations are turning to AI.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security and Emergency Response (CESER) is tasked with strengthening the resilience of the country’s energy sector by addressing emerging threats and improving energy infrastructure security. The DOE-CESER has invested more than <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ceser/cybersecurity-research-development-and-demonstration-rdd-energy-delivery-systems">$240 million</a> in cybersecurity research, development and demonstration projects since 2010.</p>
<p>In one project, the department developed a tool that uses AI to <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-08/Security%20Patch%20Automated%20Remediation%20Tool%20Analyzing%20the%20NVD%20%28SPARTAN%29%20-%20SEEDS_508.pdf">automate and optimize security vulnerability and patch management</a> in energy delivery systems. Another project for <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-11/ADDSec%20Artificial%20Diversity%20and%20Defense%20Security%20-%20SNL.pdf">artificial diversity and defense security</a> uses software-defined networks to enhance the situational awareness of energy delivery systems, helping ensure uninterrupted flows of energy.</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is charged with researching and investing in breakthrough technologies for national security, is using machine learning and AI in several areas. The <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/cyber-agents-for-security-testing-and-learning-environments">DARPA CASTLE program</a> trains AI to defend against advanced, persistent cyber threats. As part of the effort, researchers intend to accelerate cybersecurity assessments with approaches that are automated, repeatable and measurable. The <a href="https://www.gardproject.org/">DARPA GARD program</a> builds platforms, libraries, datasets and training materials to help developers build AI models that are resistant to deception and adversarial attacks.</p>
<p>To keep up with an evolving threat landscape and ensure physical security, energy security and data security, public organizations must continue integrating AI to achieve a dynamic, proactive and far-reaching cyber defense posture.</p>
<h2><strong>Financial Services: Securing Digital Transactions, Payments and Portfolios </strong></h2>
<p>Banks, asset managers, insurers and other financial service organizations are using AI and machine learning to deliver superior performance in fraud detection, portfolio management, algorithmic trading and self-service banking.</p>
<p>With constant digital transactions, payments, loans and investment trades, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/finance/">financial service institutions</a> manage some of the largest, most complex and most sensitive datasets of any industry. Behind only the healthcare industry, these organizations suffer the second highest cost of a data breach, at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/E3G5JMBP">nearly $6 million</a> per incident. This cost grows if regulators issue fines or if recovery includes legal fees and lawsuit settlements. Worse still, lost business may never be recovered if trust can’t be repaired.</p>
<p>Banks and financial institutions use AI to improve insider threat detection, detect phishing and ransomware, and keep sensitive information safe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring23-S51437/">FinSec Innovation Lab</a>, a joint venture by Mastercard and Enel X, is using AI to help its customers defend against ransomware. Prior to working with FinSec, one card-processing customer suffered a LockBit ransomware attack in which 200 company servers were infected in just 1.5 hours. The company was forced to shut down servers and suspend operations, resulting in an estimated $7 million in lost business.</p>
<p>FinSec replicated this attack in its lab but deployed the <a href="http://nvidia.com/morpheus">NVIDIA Morpheus</a> cybersecurity framework, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/networking/doca">NVIDIA DOCA</a> software framework for intrusion detection and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/data-processing-unit/">NVIDIA BlueField DPU</a> computing clusters. With this mix of AI and accelerated computing, FinSec was able to detect the ransomware attack in less than 12 seconds, quickly isolate virtual machines and recover 80% of the data on infected servers. This type of real-time response helps businesses avoid service downtime and lost business while maintaining customer trust.</p>
<p>With AI to help defend against cyberattacks, financial institutions can identify intrusions and anticipate future threats to keep financial records, accounts and transactions secure.</p>
<h2><strong>Retail: Keeping Sales Channels and Payment Credentials Safe</strong></h2>
<p>Retailers are using AI to power personalized product recommendations, dynamic pricing and customized marketing campaigns. Multichannel digital platforms have made in-store and online shopping more convenient: up to <a href="https://navigate.visa.com/na/spending-insights/seven-ways-to-use-card-on-file-to-reach-top-of-digital-wallet/">48% of consumers</a> save a card on file with a merchant, significantly boosting card-not-present transactions. While digitization has brought convenience, it has also made sensitive data more accessible to attackers.</p>
<p>Sitting on troves of digital payment credentials for millions of customers, retailers are a prime target for cybercriminals looking to take advantage of security gaps. According to a recent <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/2023/master-guide/">Data Breach Investigations Report</a> from Verizon, 37% of confirmed data disclosures in the retail industry resulted in stolen payment card data.</p>
<p>Malware attacks, ransomware and distributed denial of service attacks are all on the rise, but phishing remains the favored vector for an initial attack. With a successful phishing intrusion, criminals can steal credentials, access systems and launch ransomware.</p>
<p>Best Buy manages a network of more than 1,000 stores across the U.S. and Canada. With multichannel digital sales across both countries, protecting consumer information and transactions is critical. To defend against phishing and other cyber threats, Best Buy began using customized machine learning and NVIDIA Morpheus to better secure their infrastructure and inform their security analysts.</p>
<p>After deploying this AI-based cyber defense, the retail giant improved the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-morpheus-helps-defend-against-spear-phishing-with-generative-ai/">accuracy of phishing detection to 96%</a> while reducing false-positive rates. With a proactive approach to cybersecurity, Best Buy is protecting its reputation as a tech expert focused on customer needs.</p>
<p>From complex supply chains to third-party vendors and multichannel point-of-sale networks, expect <a href="https://info.nvidia.com/retail-cybersecurity-webinar.html">retailers to continue integrating AI</a> to protect operations as well as critical proprietary and customer data.</p>
<h2><strong>Smart Cities and Spaces: Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Transit Networks</strong></h2>
<p>IoT devices and AI that analyze movement patterns, traffic and hazardous situations have great potential to improve the safety and efficiency of spaces and infrastructure. But as airports, shipping ports, transit networks and other <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/smart-cities-and-spaces/">smart spaces</a> integrate IoT and use data, they also become more vulnerable to attack.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, there have been distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on airports and air traffic control centers and ransomware attacks on seaports, city municipalities, police departments and more. Attacks can paralyze information systems, ground flights, disrupt the flow of cargo and traffic, and delay the delivery of goods to markets. Hostile attacks could have far more serious consequences, including physical harm or loss of life.</p>
<p>In connected spaces, AI-driven security can analyze vast amounts of data to predict threats, isolate attacks and provide rapid self-healing after an intrusion. AI algorithms trained on emails can halt threats in the inbox and block phishing attempts like those that delivered <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/06/tech/japan-port-ransomware-attack/index.html">ransomware to seaports earlier</a> this year. Machine learning can be trained to recognize DDoS attack patterns to prevent the type of incoming malicious traffic that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-atlanta-680cf93f7eb0300127448c35299ad66e">brought down U.S. airport websites</a> last year.</p>
<p>Organizations adopting smart space technology, such as the Port of Los Angeles, are making efforts to get ahead of the threat landscape. In 2014, the Port of LA established a cybersecurity operations center and hired a dedicated cybersecurity team. In 2021, the port followed up with a cyber resilience center to enhance early-warning detection for cyberattacks that have the potential to impact the flow of cargo.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has developed an <a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2022-08/PL_115-254_Sec_741_Certification_of_New_Technologies_into_the_NAS.pdf">AI certification framework</a> that assesses the trustworthiness of AI and ML applications. The FAA also implements a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/06/07/what-is-zero-trust/">zero-trust</a> cyber approach, enforces strict access control and runs continuous verification across its digital environment.</p>
<p>By bolstering cybersecurity and integrating AI, smart space and transport infrastructure administrators can offer secure access to physical spaces and digital networks to protect the uninterrupted movement of people and goods.</p>
<h2><strong>Telecommunications: Ensure Network Resilience and Block Incoming Threats</strong></h2>

AI can continuously assess the trustworthiness of devices, users and applications, thereby shortening the time needed to identify fraudsters.</p>
<p>Pretrained AI models can be deployed to protect 5G networks from threats such as malware, data exfiltration and DOS attacks.</p>
<p>Using deep learning and NVIDIA BlueField DPUs, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/07/12/palo-alto-networks-cyber-defenses/">Palo Alto Networks</a> has built a next-generation firewall addressing 5G needs, maximizing cybersecurity performance while maintaining a small infrastructure footprint. The DPU powers accelerated intelligent network filtering to parse, classify and steer traffic to improve performance and isolate threats. With more efficient computing that deploys fewer servers, telcos can maximize return on investment for compute investments and minimize digital attack surface areas.</p>
<p>By putting AI to work, telcos can build secure, encrypted networks to ensure network availability and data security for both individual and enterprise customers.</p>
<h2><strong>Automotive: Insulate Vehicle Software From Outside Influence and Attack </strong></h2>
<p>Modern cars <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/">rely on complex AI and ML</a> software stacks running on in-vehicle computers to process data from cameras and other sensors. These vehicles are essentially giant, moving IoT devices — they perceive the environment, make decisions, advise drivers and even control the vehicle with autonomous driving features.</p>
<p>Like other connected devices, autonomous vehicles are susceptible to various types of cyberattacks. Bad actors can infiltrate and compromise AV software both on board and from third-party providers. Denial of service attacks can disrupt over-the-air software updates that vehicles rely on to operate safely. Unauthorized access to communications systems like onboard WiFi, Bluetooth or RFID can expose vehicle systems to the risk of remote manipulation and data theft. This can jeopardize geolocation and sensor data, operational data, driver and passenger data, all of which are crucial to functional safety and the driving experience.</p>
<p>AI-based cybersecurity can help monitor in-car and network activities in real time, allowing for rapid response to threats. AI can be deployed to secure and authenticate over-the-air updates to prevent tampering and ensure the authenticity of software updates. AI-driven encryption can protect data transmitted over WiFi, Bluetooth and RFID connections. AI can also probe vehicle systems for vulnerabilities and take remedial steps.</p>
<p>Ranging from AI-powered access control to unlock and start vehicles to detecting deviations in sensor performance and patching security vulnerabilities, AI will play a crucial role in the safe development and deployment of autonomous vehicles on our roads.</p>
<h2><strong>Keeping Operations Secure and Customers Happy With AI Cybersecurity </strong></h2>
<p>By deploying AI to protect valuable data and digital operations, industries can focus their resources on innovating better products, improving customer experiences and creating new business value.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[AI technologies are having a massive impact across industries, including media and entertainment, automotive, customer service and more.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>AI technologies are having a massive impact across industries, including media and entertainment, automotive, customer service and more. For game developers, these advances are paving the way for creating more realistic and immersive in-game experiences.</p>
<p>From creating lifelike characters that convey emotions to transforming simple text into captivating imagery, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/03/13/what-are-foundation-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foundation models</a> are becoming essential in accelerating developer workflows while reducing overall costs. These powerful AI models have unlocked a realm of possibilities, empowering designers and game developers to build higher-quality gaming experiences.</p>
<h2><b>What Are Foundation Models?</b></h2>
<p>A foundation model is a neural network that’s trained on massive amounts of data — and then adapted to tackle a wide variety of tasks. They’re capable of enabling a range of general tasks, such as text, image and audio generation. Over the last year, the popularity and use of foundation models has rapidly increased, with hundreds now available.</p>
<p>For example, GPT-4 is a large multimodal model developed by OpenAI that can generate human-like text based on context and past conversations. Another, DALL-E 3, can create realistic images and artwork from a description written in natural language.</p>
<p>Powerful foundation models like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA NeMo</a> and Edify model in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/picasso/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Picasso</a> make it easy for companies and developers to inject AI into their existing workflows. For example, using the NVIDIA NeMo framework, organizations can quickly train, customize and deploy <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> models at scale. And using NVIDIA Picasso, teams can fine-tune pretrained Edify models with their own enterprise data to build custom products and services for generative AI images, videos, 3D assets, texture materials and 360 HDRi.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA NeMo Service | Boosting Enterprise Productivity with Customized Generative AI Models" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J86qoG6zG58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>How Are Foundation Models Built?</b></h2>
<p>Foundation models can be used as a base for AI systems that can perform multiple tasks. Organizations can easily and quickly use a large amount of unlabeled data to create their own foundation models.</p>
<p>The dataset should be as large and diverse as possible, as too little data or poor-quality data can lead to inaccuracies — sometimes called hallucinations — or cause finer details to go missing in generated outputs.</p>
<p>Next, the dataset must be prepared. This includes cleaning the data, removing errors and formatting it in such a way that the model can understand it. Bias is a pervasive issue when preparing a dataset, so it’s important to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3597307" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measure, reduce and tackle</a> these inconsistencies and inaccuracies.</p>
<p>Training a foundational model can be time-consuming, especially given the size of the model and the amount of data required. Hardware like NVIDIA A100 or H100 Tensor Core GPUs, along with high-performance data systems like the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, can accelerate training. For example, ChatGPT-3 was trained on over 1,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs over about 34 days.</p>

<p>After ‌training, the foundation model is evaluated on quality, diversity and speed. There are <a href="https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-model-evaluation/#5-commonly-used-performance-evaluation-methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several methods</a> for evaluating performance, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools and frameworks that quantify how well the model predicts a sample of text</li>
<li>Metrics that compare generated outputs with one or more references and measure the similarities between them</li>
<li>Human evaluators who assess the quality of the generated output on various criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the model passes the relevant tests and evaluations, it can then be deployed for production.</p>
<h2><b>Exploring Foundation Models in Games</b></h2>
<p>Pretrained foundation models can be leveraged by middleware, tools and game developers both during production and at run-time. To train a base model, resources and time are necessary — alongside a certain level of expertise. Currently, many developers within the gaming industry are exploring off-the-shelf models, but need custom solutions that fit their specific use cases. They need models that are trained on commercially safe data and optimized for real-time performance — without exorbitant costs of deployment. The difficulty of meeting these requirements has slowed adoption of foundation models.</p>
<p>However, innovation within the generative AI space is swift, and once major hurdles are addressed, developers of all sizes — from startups to AAA studios — will use foundation models to gain new efficiencies in game development and accelerate content creation. Additionally, these models can help create completely new gameplay experiences.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA ACE Enhanced with Dynamic Responses for Virtual Characters" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lf0z8Z3OQvM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The top industry use cases are centered around intelligent agents and AI-powered animation and asset creation. For example, many creators today are exploring models for creating intelligent non-playable characters, or NPCs.</p>
<p>Custom LLMs fine-tuned with the lingo and lore of specific games can generate human-like text, understand context and respond to prompts in a coherent manner. They’re designed to learn patterns and language structures and understand game state changes — evolving and progressing alongside the player in the game.</p>
<p>As NPCs become increasingly dynamic,real-time animation and audio that sync with their responses will be needed. Developers are using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/riva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Riva</a> to create expressive character voices using speech and translation AI. And designers are tapping <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Audio2Face</a> for AI-powered facial animations.</p>
<p>Foundation models are also being used for asset and animation generation. Asset creation during the pre-production and production phases of game development can be time-consuming, tedious and expensive.</p>
<p>With state-of-the-art diffusion models, developers can iterate more quickly, freeing up time to spend on the most important aspects of the content pipeline, such as developing higher-quality assets and iterating. The ability to fine-tune these models from a studio’s own repository of data ensures the outputs generated are similar to the art styles and designs of their previous games.</p>
<p>Foundation models are readily available, and the gaming industry is only in the beginning phases of understanding their full capabilities. Various solutions have been built for real-time experiences, but the use cases are limited. Fortunately, developers can easily access models and microservices through cloud APIs today and explore how AI can affect their games and scale their solutions to more customers and devices than ever before.</p>
<h2><b>The Future of Foundation Models in Gaming</b><b><br />
</b></h2>
<p>Foundation models are poised to help developers realize the future of gaming. Diffusion models and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language models</a> are becoming much more lightweight as developers look to run them natively on a range of hardware power profiles, including PCs, consoles and mobile devices.</p>
<p>The accuracy and quality of these models will only continue to improve as developers look to generate high-quality assets that need little to no touching up before being dropped into an AAA gaming experience.</p>
<p>Foundation models will also be used in areas that have been challenging for developers to overcome with traditional technology. For example, autonomous agents can help analyze and detect world space during game development, which will accelerate processes for quality assurance.</p>
<p>The rise of multimodal foundation models, which can ingest a mix of text, image, audio and other inputs simultaneously, will further enhance player interactions with intelligent NPCs and other game systems. Also, developers can use additional input types to improve creativity and enhance the quality of generated assets during production.</p>
<p>Multimodal models also show great promise in improving the animation of real-time characters, one of the most time-intensive and expensive processes of game development. They may be able to help make characters’ locomotion identical to real-life actors, infuse style and feel from a range of inputs, and ease the rigging process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The home of the first industrial revolution just made a massive investment in the next one.</p>
<p>The U.K. government has announced it will spend £225 million ($273 million) to build one of the world’s fastest AI supercomputers.</p>
<p>Called Isambard-AI, it’s the latest in a series of systems named after a legendary 19th century British engineer and hosted by the University of Bristol. When fully installed next year, it will pack 5,448 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/">NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips</a> to deliver a whopping 21 exaflops of AI performance for researchers across the country and beyond.</p>
<p>The announcement was made at the AI Safety Summit, a gathering of over 100 global government and technology leaders, held in Bletchley Park, the site of the world’s first digital programmable computer, which reflected the work of innovators like Alan Turing, considered the father of AI.</p>
<p>AI “will bring a transformation as far-reaching as the industrial revolution, the coming of electricity or the birth of the internet,” said British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a speech last week about the event, designed to catalyze international collaboration.</p>
<h2><b>Propelling the Modern Economy</b></h2>
<p>Like one of Isambard Brunel’s creations — the first propeller-driven, ocean-going iron ship — the AI technology running on his namesake is already driving countries forward.</p>
<p>AI contributes more than £3.7 billion to the U.K. economy and employs more than 50,000 people, said Michelle Donelan, the nation’s Science, Innovation and Technology Secretary, in an earlier announcement about the system.</p>
<p>The investment in the so-called AI Research Resource in Bristol “will catalyze scientific discovery and keep the U.K. at the forefront of AI development,” she said.</p>
<p>Like AI itself, the system will be used across a wide range of organizations tapping the potential of machine learning to advance robotics, data analytics, drug discovery, climate research and more.</p>
<p>“Isambard-AI represents a huge leap forward for AI computational power in the U.K.,” said Simon McIntosh-Smith, a Bristol professor and director of the Isambard National Research Facility. “Today, Isambard-AI would rank within the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world and, when in operation later in 2024, it will be one of the most powerful AI systems for open science anywhere.”</p>
<h2><b>The Next Manufacturing Revolution</b></h2>
<p>Like the industrial revolution, AI promises advances in manufacturing. That’s one reason why Isambard-AI will be based at the National Composites Centre (NCC, pictured above) in the Bristol and Bath Science Park, one of the country’s seven manufacturing research centers.</p>
<p>The U.K.’s Frontier AI Taskforce, a research group leading a global effort on how frontier AI can be safely developed, will also be a major user of the system.</p>
<p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which is building Isambard-AI, is also collaborating with the University of Bristol on energy-efficiency plans that support net-zero carbon targets mandated by the British government.</p>
<h2><b>Energy-Efficient HPC</b></h2>
<p>A second system coming next year to the NCC will show Arm’s energy efficiency for non-accelerated high performance computing workloads.</p>
<p>Isambard-3 will deliver an estimated 2.7 petaflops of FP64 peak performance and consume less than 270 kilowatts of power, ranking it among the world’s three greenest non-accelerated supercomputers. That’s because the system — part of a research alliance among universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter — will sport 384 Arm-based <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-cpu-superchip/">NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchips</a> to power medical and scientific research.</p>
<p>“Isambard-3’s application performance efficiency of up to 6x its predecessor, which rivals many of the 50 fastest TOP500 systems, will provide scientists with a revolutionary new supercomputing platform to advance groundbreaking research,” said Bristol’s McIntosh-Smith, when the system was <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-grace-drives-wave-of-new-energy-efficient-arm-supercomputers">announced</a> in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">Generative AI</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">large language models</a> are stirring change across industries — but according to NVIDIA Senior Product Manager of Developer Marketing Annamalai Chockalingam, “we’re still in the early innings.”</p>
<p>In the latest episode of NVIDIA’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/ai-podcast/">AI Podcast</a>, host Noah Kravitz spoke with Chockalingam about LLMs: what they are, their current state and their future potential.</p>
<p>Describing LLMs as a “subset of the larger generative AI movement,” Chockalingam says they can do five things with language: generate, summarize, translate, instruct or chat. With a combination of “these modalities and actions, you can build applications” to solve any problem, he said.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1651053912%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-5uJAR5koNPP&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Enterprises are tapping LLMs to drive innovation, develop new customer experiences and gain a competitive advantage, he said. They’re also exploring what safe deployment of those models looks like, aiming to achieve responsible development, trustworthiness and repeatability.</p>
<p>New techniques like retrieval augmented generation could boost LLM development. RAG involves feeding models with up-to-date data sources or third-party APIs to achieve “more appropriate responses,” Chockalingam said — granting them current context so that they can “generate better” answers.</p>
<p>Chockalingam encourages those interested in LLMs to “get your hands dirty and get started” — whether that means using popular applications like ChatGPT or playing with pretrained models in the <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/?filters=&amp;orderBy=weightPopularDESC&amp;query=">NVIDIA NGC catalog</a>.NVIDIA offers a full-stack computing platform for developers and enterprises experimenting with LLMs, with an ecosystem of over 4 million developers and 1,600 generative AI organizations.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>In the world’s largest solar race car event of the year, the University of New South Wales Sunswift Racing team is having its day in the sun.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://worldsolarchallenge.org/">World Solar Challenge</a>, which first began some 35 years ago, attracts academic participants from across the globe. This year’s event drew nearly 100 competitors.</p>
<p>The race runs nearly 1,900 miles over the course of about four days and pits challengers in a battle not for speed but for greatest energy efficiency.</p>
<p>UNSW Sydney won the energy efficiency competition and crossed the finish line first, taking the Cruiser Cup with its Sunswift 7 vehicle, which utilizes <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/">NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX</a> for energy optimization. It was also the only competitor to race with 4 people on board and a remote mission control team.</p>
<p>“It’s a completely different proposition to say we can use the least amount of energy and arrive in Adelaide before anybody else, but crossing the line first is just about bragging rights,” said Richard Hopkins, project manager at Sunswift and a UNSW professor. Hopkins previously managed Formula 1 race teams in the U.K.</p>
<p>Race organizers bill the event, which cuts across the entire Australian continent on public roads — from Darwin in the north to Adelaide in the south — as the “world’s greatest innovation and engineering challenge contributing to a more sustainable mobility future.” It’s also become a launchpad for students pursuing career paths in the electric vehicle industry.</p>
<p>Like many of the competitors, UNSW is coming back after a three-year hiatus from the race due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making this year’s competition highly anticipated.</p>
<p>“Every single team member needs to understand what they’re doing and what their role is on the team and perform at the very best during those five-and-a-half days,” said Hopkins. “It is exhausting.”</p>
<h2><b>All In on Energy Efficiency  </b></h2>
<p>The race allows participants to start with a fully charged battery and to charge when the vehicles stop for the night at two locations. The remaining energy used, some 90%, comes from the sun and the vehicles’ solar panels.</p>
<p>UNSW’s seventh-generation Sunswift 7 runs algorithms to optimize for energy efficiency, essentially shutting down all nonessential computing to maximize battery life.</p>
<p>The solar electric vehicle relies on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a> AI to give it an edge across its roughly 100 automotive monitoring and power management systems.</p>
<p>It can also factor in whether it should drive faster or slower based on weather forecasts. For instance, the car will urge the driver to go faster if it’s going to rain later in the day when conditions would force the car to slow down.</p>
<p>The Sunswift 7 vehicle was designed to mostly drive in a straight line from Darwin to Adelaide, and the object is to use the least amount of power outside of that mission, said Hopkins.</p>
<p>“Sunswift 7 late last year was featured in the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> for being the fastest electric vehicle for over 1,000 kilometers on a single charge of battery,” he said.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sunswift 7 (Ep 04 - Guinness World Record attempt ) - Fastest EV over 1000k on a single charge." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jm1Efr8vlk4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Jetson-Based Racers for Learning</b></h2>
<p>The UNSW team created nearly 60 design iterations to improve on the aerodynamics of the vehicle. They used computational fluid dynamics modeling and ran simulations to analyze each version.</p>
<p>“We didn’t ever put the car through a physical wind tunnel,” said Hopkins.</p>
<p>The technical team has been working on a model to determine what speed the vehicle should be driven at for maximum energy conservation. “They’re working on taking in as many parameters as you can, given it’s really hard to get good driving data,” said Josh Bramley, technology manager at Sunswift Racing.</p>
<p>Sunswift 7 is running on the Robot Operating System (ROS) suite of software and relies on its NVIDIA Jetson module to process all the input from the sensors for analytics, which can be monitored by the remote pit crew back on campus at UNSW.</p>
<p>Jetson is used for all the control systems on the car, so everything from the accelerator pedal, wheel sensors, solar current sensors and more are processed on it for data to analyze for ways AI might help, said Bramley. The next version of the vehicle is expected to pack more AI, he added.</p>
<p>“A lot of the AI and computer vision will be coming for Sunswift 8 in the next solar challenge,” said Bramley.</p>
<p>More than 100 students are getting course credit for the Sunswift Racing team work, and many are interested in pursuing careers in electric vehicles, said Hopkins.</p>
<p>Past World Solar Challenge contestants have gone on to work at Tesla, SpaceX and Zipline.</p>

<p>The latest Halloween-themed Studio Standouts video features ghouls, creepy monsters, haunted hospitals, dimly lit homes and is not for the faint-of-heart.</p>
<h2><b>Remarkable Ray Reconstruction</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS 3.5</a> — featuring Ray Reconstruction — enhances ray-traced image quality on GeForce RTX GPUs by replacing hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 | New Ray Reconstruction Enhances Ray Tracing with AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGKCrcNsVzo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Previewing content in the viewport, even with high-end hardware, can sometimes offer less than ideal image quality, as traditional denoisers require hand-tuning for every scene.</p>
<p>With DLSS 3.5, the AI neural network recognizes a wide variety of scenes, producing high-quality preview images and drastically reducing time spent rendering scenes.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Omniverse and the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/usd-composer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USD Composer</a> app — featuring the Omniverse RTX Renderer — specialize in real-time preview modes, offering ray-tracing inference and higher-quality previews while building and iterating.</p>
<p>The feature can be enabled by opening “Render Settings” under “Ray Tracing,” opening the “Direct Lighting” tab and ensuring “New Denoiser (experimental)” is turned on.</p>

<p>Then he carefully positions his projectors — building protective casings to keep them both safe and blended into the scene.</p>

<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>“In the last few years, I’ve rendered 32,862 frames of 5K animation out of the Octane Render Engine. The loop has now become 21 minutes long, and the musical show is another 28 minutes!” — Sabour Amirazodi</p>
</div>
<p>Building a virtual scene onto a physical object requires projection mapping, so Amirazodi used NVIDIA GPU-accelerated MadMapper software and its structured light-scan feature to map custom visuals onto his house. He achieved this by connecting a DSLR camera to his mobile workstation, which was powered by an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a5000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPU</a>.</p>
<p>He used the camera to shoot a series of lines and capture photos. Then, he translated to the projector’s point of view an image on which to base a 3D model. Basic camera-matching tools found in Cinema 4D helped recreate the scene. Afterward, Amirazodi applied various mapping and perspective correction edits.</p>

<p>Next, Amirazodi animated and rigged the characters. GPU acceleration in the viewport enabled smooth interactivity with complex 3D models.</p>
<p>“I like having a choice between several third-party NVIDIA GPU-accelerated 3D renderers, such as V-Ray, OctaneRender and Redshift in Cinema 4D,” noted Amirazodi.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>“I switched to NVIDIA graphics cards in 2017. GPUs are the only way to go for serious creators.” — Sabour Amirazodi</p>
</div>
<p>Amirazodi then spent hours on his <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a6000/">RTX 6000</a> workstation creating and rendering out all the animations, assembling them in Adobe After Effects and compositing them on the scanned canvas in MadMapper. There, he crafted individual scenes to render out as chunks and assembled them in Adobe Premiere Pro. Remarkably, he repeated this workflow for every projector.</p>
<p>Once satisfied with the sequences, Amirazodi encoded everything using Adobe Media Encoder and loaded them onto BrightSign digital players — all networked to run the show synchronously.</p>
<p>Amirazodi used the advantages of GPU acceleration to streamline his workflow — saving him countless hours. “After Effects has numerous plug-ins that are GPU-accelerated — plus, Adobe Premiere Pro and Media Encoder use the new dual encoders found in the Ada generation of NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs, cutting my export times in half,” he said.</p>

<p>Amirazodi’s careful efforts are all in the Halloween spirit — creating a hauntingly memorable experience for his community.</p>
<p>“The hard work and long nights all become worth it when I see the smile on my kids’ faces and all the joy it brings to the entire neighborhood,” he reflected.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>A <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2023-10_chipnemo-domain-adapted-llms-chip-design">research paper</a> released today describes ways <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> can assist one of the most complex engineering efforts: designing semiconductors.</p>
<p>The work demonstrates how companies in highly specialized fields can train large language models (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">LLMs</a>) on their internal data to build assistants that increase productivity.</p>
<p>Few pursuits are as challenging as semiconductor design. Under a microscope, a state-of-the-art chip like an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU</a> (above) looks like a well-planned metropolis, built with tens of billions of transistors, connected on streets 10,000x thinner than a human hair.</p>
<p>Multiple engineering teams coordinate for as long as two years to construct one of these digital megacities.</p>
<p>Some groups define the chip’s overall architecture, some craft and place a variety of ultra-small circuits, and others test their work. Each job requires specialized methods, software programs and computer languages.</p>
<h2><b>A Broad Vision for LLMs</b></h2>
<p>“I believe over time large language models will help all the processes, across the board,” said Mark Ren, an NVIDIA Research director and lead author on the paper.</p>
<p>Bill Dally, NVIDIA’s chief scientist, announced the paper today in a keynote at the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, an annual gathering of hundreds of engineers working in the field called electronic design automation, or EDA.</p>
<p>“This effort marks an important first step in applying LLMs to the complex work of designing semiconductors,” said Dally at the event in San Francisco. “It shows how even highly specialized fields can use their internal data to train useful generative AI models.”</p>
<h2><b>ChipNeMo Surfaces</b></h2>
<p>The paper details how NVIDIA engineers created for their internal use a custom LLM, called ChipNeMo, trained on the company’s internal data to generate and optimize software and assist human designers.</p>
<p>Long term, engineers hope to apply generative AI to each stage of chip design, potentially reaping significant gains in overall productivity, said Ren, whose career spans more than 20 years in EDA.</p>
<p>After surveying NVIDIA engineers for possible use cases, the research team chose three to start: a chatbot, a code generator and an analysis tool.</p>
<h2><b>Initial Use Cases</b></h2>
<p>The latter — a tool that automates the time-consuming tasks of maintaining updated descriptions of known bugs — has been the most well-received so far.</p>
<p>A prototype chatbot that responds to questions about GPU architecture and design helped many engineers quickly find technical documents in early tests.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67780" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67780" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNemo.gif"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-67780 size-full" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNemo.gif" alt="Animation of a generative AI code generator using an LLM" width="600" height="338" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67780" class="wp-caption-text">A code generator will help designers write software for a chip design.</figcaption></figure>
<p>A code generator in development (demonstrated above)  already creates snippets of about 10-20 lines of software in two specialized languages chip designers use. It will be integrated with existing tools, so engineers have a handy assistant for designs in progress.</p>
<h2><b>Customizing AI Models With NVIDIA NeMo</b></h2>
<p>The paper mainly focuses on the team’s work gathering its design data and using it to create a specialized generative AI model, a process portable to any industry.</p>
<p>As its starting point, the team chose a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/03/13/what-are-foundation-models/">foundation model</a> and customized it with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, a framework for building, customizing and deploying generative AI models that’s included in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform. The selected NeMo model sports 43 billion parameters, a measure of its capability to understand patterns. It was trained using more than a trillion tokens, the words and symbols in text and software.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67773" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67773" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67773" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final-672x338.jpg" alt="Diagram of the ChipNeMo workflow for training a custom model" width="672" height="338" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final-672x338.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final-400x201.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final-768x386.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final-842x423.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final-406x204.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final-188x95.jpg 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final.jpg 1277w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67773" class="wp-caption-text">ChipNeMo provides an example of how one deeply technical team refined a pretrained model with its own data.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The team then refined the model in two training rounds, the first using about 24 billion tokens worth of its internal design data and the second on a mix of about 130,000 conversation and design examples.</p>
<p>The work is among several examples of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10204.pdf">research</a> and <a href="https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/explore/large-language-models-llms.html">proofs of concept</a> of generative AI in the semiconductor industry, just beginning to emerge from the lab.</p>
<h2><b>Sharing Lessons Learned</b></h2>
<p>One of the most important lessons Ren’s team learned is the value of customizing an LLM.</p>
<p>On chip-design tasks, custom ChipNeMo models with as few as 13 billion parameters match or exceed performance of even much larger general-purpose LLMs like LLaMA2 with 70 billion parameters. In some use cases, ChipNeMo models were dramatically better.</p>
<p>Along the way, users need to exercise care in what data they collect and how they clean it for use in training, he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Researchers are taking deep learning for a deep dive, literally.</p>
<p>The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) Autonomous Robotics and Perception Laboratory (<a href="https://warp.whoi.edu/">WARPLab</a>) and MIT are developing a robot for studying coral reefs and their ecosystems.</p>
<p>The WARPLab autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), enabled by an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX</a> module, is an effort from the world’s largest private ocean research institution to turn the tide on reef declines.</p>
<p>Some 25% of coral reefs worldwide have vanished in the past three decades, and most of the remaining reefs are heading for extinction, according to the <a href="https://reefsolutions.whoi.edu/">WHOI Reef Solutions Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>The AUV, dubbed CUREE (Curious Underwater Robot for Ecosystem Exploration), gathers visual, audio, and other environmental data alongside divers to help understand the human impact on reefs and the sea life around them. The robot runs an expanding collection of NVIDIA Jetson-enabled edge AI to build 3D models of reefs and to track creatures and plant life. It also runs models to navigate and collect data autonomously.</p>
<p>WHOI, whose submarine first explored the Titanic in 1986, is developing its CUREE robot for data gathering to scale the effort and aid in mitigation strategies. The oceanic research organization is also exploring the use of simulation and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/12/14/what-is-a-digital-twin/">digital twins</a> to better replicate reef conditions and investigate solutions like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a development platform for building and connecting 3D tools and applications.</p>
<p>Creating a digital twin of Earth in Omniverse, NVIDIA is developing the world’s most powerful AI supercomputer for predicting climate change, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/11/12/earth-2-supercomputer/">called Earth-2</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Underwater AI: DeepSeeColor Model</b></h2>
<p>Anyone who’s gone snorkeling knows that seeing underwater isn’t as clear as seeing on land. Over distance, water attenuates the visible spectrum of light from the sun underwater, muting some colors more than others. At the same time, particles in the water create a hazy view, known as backscatter.</p>
<p>A team from WARPLab recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04025.pdf">published a research paper</a> on undersea vision correction that helps mitigate these problems and supports the work of CUREE. The paper describes a model, called DeepSeeColor, that uses a sequence of two <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/09/05/whats-the-difference-between-a-cnn-and-an-rnn/">convolutional neural networks</a> to reduce backscatter and correct colors in real time on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX while undersea.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA GPUs are involved in a large portion of our pipeline because, basically, when the images come in, we use DeepSeeColor to color correct them, and then we can do the fish detection and transmit that to a scientist up at the surface on a boat,” said Stewart Jamieson, a robotics Ph.D. candidate at MIT and AI developer at WARPLab.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DeepSeeColor: Removing backscatter and color attenuation from underwater images in realtime" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vpge92KRU1M?start=1&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Eyes and Ears: Fish and Reef Detection</b></h2>
<p>CUREE packs four forward-facing cameras, four hydrophones for underwater audio capture, depth sensors and inertial measurement unit sensors. GPS doesn’t work underwater, so it is only used to initialize the robot’s starting position while on the surface.</p>
<p>Using a combination of cameras and hydrophones along with AI models running on the Jetson Orin NX enables CUREE to collect data for producing 3D models of reefs and undersea terrains.</p>
<p>To use the hydrophones for audio data collection, CUREE needs to drift with its motor off so that there’s no interference with the audio.</p>
<p>“It can build a spatial soundscape map of the reef, using sounds produced by different animals,” said Yogesh Girdhar, an associate scientist at WHOI, who leads WARPLab. “We currently (in post-processing) detect where all the chatter associated with bioactivity hotspots is,” he added, referring to all the noises of sea life.</p>
<p>The team has been training detection models for both audio and video input to track creatures. But a big noise interference with detecting clear audio samples has come from one creature in particular.</p>
<p>“The problem is that, underwater, the snapping shrimps are loud,” said Girdhar. On land, this classic dilemma of how to separate sounds from background noises is known as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/08/28/music-youtube-cocktail-party-problem-ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-learning/">the cocktail party problem</a>. “If only we could figure out an algorithm to remove the effects of sounds of snapping shrimps from audio, but at the moment we don’t have a good solution,” said Girdhar.</p>
<p>Despite few underwater datasets in existence, <a href="https://warp.whoi.edu/vmat/">pioneering fish detection and tracking</a> is going well, said Levi Cai, a Ph.D. candidate in the MIT-WHOI joint program. He said they’re taking a semi-supervised approach to the marine animal tracking problem. The tracking is initialized using targets detected by a <a href="https://github.com/warplab/megafishdetector">fish detection neural network</a> trained on open-source datasets for fish detection, which is fine-tuned with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/02/07/what-is-transfer-learning/">transfer learning</a> from images gathered by CUREE.</p>
<p>“We manually drive the vehicle until we see an animal that we want to track, and then we click on it and have the semi-supervised tracker take over from there,” said Cai.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tracking a barracuda using CUREE" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s_PBaYIqNKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Jetson Orin Energy Efficiency Drives CUREE</b></h2>
<p>Energy efficiency is critical for small AUVs like CUREE. The compute requirements for data collection consume roughly 25% of the available energy resources, with driving the robots taking the remainder.</p>
<p>CUREE typically operates for as long as two hours on a charge, depending on the reef mission and the observation requirements, said Girdhar, who goes on the dive missions in St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>To enhance energy efficiency, the team is looking into AI for managing the sensors so that computing resources automatically stay awake while making observations and sleep when not in use.</p>
<p>“Our robot is small, so the amount of energy spent on GPU computing actually matters — with Jetson Orin NX our power issues are gone, and it’s made our system much more robust,” said  Girdhar.</p>
<h2><b>Exploring Isaac Sim to Make Improvements </b></h2>
<p>The WARPLab team is experimenting with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim">NVIDIA Isaac Sim</a>, a scalable robotics simulation application and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/06/08/what-is-synthetic-data/">synthetic data</a> generation tool powered by Omniverse, to accelerate development of autonomy and observation for CUREE.</p>
<p>The goal is to do simple simulations in Isaac Sim to get the core essence of the problem to be simulated and then finish the training in the real world undersea, said Yogesh.</p>
<p>“In a coral reef environment, we cannot depend on sonars — we need to get up really close,” he said. “Our goal is to observe different ecosystems and processes happening.”</p>
<h2><b>Understanding Ecosystems and Creating Mitigation Strategies</b></h2>
<p>The WARPLab team intends to make the CUREE platform available for others to understand the impact humans are having on undersea environments and to help create mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>The researchers plan to learn from patterns that emerge from the data. CUREE provides an almost fully autonomous data collection scientist that can communicate findings to human researchers, said Jamieson. “A scientist gets way more out of this than if the task had to be done manually, driving it around staring at a screen all day,” he said.</p>
<p>Girdhar said that ecosystems like coral reefs can be modeled with a network, with different nodes corresponding to different types of species and habitat types. Within that, he said, there are all these different interactions happening, and the researchers seek to understand this network to learn about the relationship between various animals and their habitats.</p>
<p>The hope is that there’s enough data collected using CUREE AUVs to gain a comprehensive understanding of ecosystems and how they might progress over time and be affected by harbors, pesticide runoff, carbon emissions and dive tourism, he said.</p>
<p>“We can then better design and deploy interventions and determine, for example, if we planted new corals how they would change the reef over time,” said Girdar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA researchers are collaborating with academic centers worldwide to advance <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>, robotics and the natural sciences — and more than a dozen of these projects will be shared at <a href="https://neurips.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeurIPS</a>, one of the world’s top AI conferences.</p>
<p>Set for Dec. 10-16 in New Orleans, NeurIPS brings together experts in generative AI, machine learning, computer vision and more. Among the innovations <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/">NVIDIA Research</a> will present are new techniques for transforming text to images, photos to 3D avatars, and specialized robots into multi-talented machines.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA Research continues to drive progress across the field — including generative AI models that transform text to images or speech, autonomous AI agents that learn new tasks faster, and neural networks that calculate complex physics,” said Jan Kautz, vice president of learning and perception research at NVIDIA. “These projects, often done in collaboration with leading minds in academia, will help accelerate developers of virtual worlds, simulations and autonomous machines.”</p>
<h2><b>Picture This: Improving Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</b></h2>
<p>Diffusion models have become the most popular type of generative AI models to turn text into realistic imagery. NVIDIA researchers have collaborated with universities on multiple projects advancing diffusion models that will be presented at NeurIPS.</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 300;">
<li>A paper accepted as an oral presentation focuses on improving generative AI models’ ability to <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/oral/73870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">understand the link between modifier words and main entities</a> in text prompts. While existing text-to-image models asked to depict a yellow tomato and a red lemon may incorrectly generate images of yellow lemons and red tomatoes, the new model analyzes the syntax of a user’s prompt, encouraging a bond between an entity and its modifiers to deliver a more faithful visual depiction of the prompt.</li>
<li>SceneScape, a new framework using <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/71859" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diffusion models to create long videos of 3D scenes from text prompts</a>, will be presented as a poster. The project combines a text-to-image model with a depth prediction model that helps the videos maintain plausible-looking scenes with consistency between the frames — generating videos of art museums, haunted houses and ice castles (pictured above).</li>
<li>Another poster describes work that improves how text-to-image models <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/70922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate concepts rarely seen in training data</a>. Attempts to generate such images usually result in low-quality visuals that aren’t an exact match to the user’s prompt. The new method uses a small set of example images that help the model identify good seeds — random number sequences that guide the AI to generate images from the specified rare classes.</li>
<li>A third poster shows how a text-to-image diffusion model can <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/70648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use the text description of an incomplete point cloud</a> to generate missing parts and create a complete 3D model of the object. This could help complete point cloud data collected by lidar scanners and other depth sensors for robotics and autonomous vehicle AI applications. Collected imagery is often incomplete because objects are scanned from a specific angle — for example, a lidar sensor mounted to a vehicle would only scan one side of each building as the car drives down a street.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67733" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-672x222.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="222" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-672x222.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-400x132.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-768x253.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-1536x506.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-842x278.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-406x134.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-188x62.jpg 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-1280x422.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Character Development: Advancements in AI Avatars</b></h2>
<p>AI avatars combine multiple generative AI models to create and animate virtual characters, produce text and convert it to speech. Two NVIDIA posters at NeurIPS present new ways to make these tasks more efficient.</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 300;">
<li>A poster describes a new method to <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/72615" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn a single portrait image into a 3D head avatar</a> while capturing details including hairstyles and accessories. Unlike current methods that require multiple images and a time-consuming optimization process, this model achieves high-fidelity 3D reconstruction without additional optimization during inference. The avatars can be animated either with blendshapes, which are 3D mesh representations used to represent different facial expressions, or with a reference video clip where a person’s facial expressions and motion are applied to the avatar.</li>
<li>Another poster by NVIDIA researchers and university collaborators advances zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis with P-Flow, a generative AI model that can <a href="https://pflow-demo.github.io/projects/pflow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapidly synthesize high-quality personalized speech</a> given a three-second reference prompt. P-Flow features better pronunciation, human likeness and speaker similarity compared to recent state-of-the-art counterparts. The model can near-instantly convert text to speech on a single <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Research Breakthroughs in Reinforcement Learning, Robotics</b></h2>
<p>In the fields of reinforcement learning and robotics, NVIDIA researchers will present two posters highlighting innovations that improve the generalizability of AI across different tasks and environments.</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 300;">
<li>The first proposes a <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/72040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">framework for developing reinforcement learning algorithms</a> that can adapt to new tasks while avoiding the common pitfalls of gradient bias and data inefficiency. The researchers showed that their method — which features a novel meta-algorithm that can create a robust version of <i>any</i> meta-reinforcement learning model — performed well on multiple benchmark tasks.</li>
<li>Another by an NVIDIA researcher and university collaborators tackles the challenge of <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/71709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">object manipulation in robotics</a>. Prior AI models that help robotic hands pick up and interact with objects can handle specific shapes but struggle with objects unseen in the training data. The researchers introduce a new framework that estimates how objects across different categories are geometrically alike — such as drawers and pot lids that have similar handles — enabling the model to more quickly generalize to new shapes.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Supercharging Science: AI-Accelerated Physics, Climate, Healthcare</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA researchers at NeurIPS will also present papers across the natural sciences — covering physics simulations, climate models and AI for healthcare.</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 300;">
<li>To accelerate <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/72670" target="_blank" rel="noopener">computational fluid dynamics for large-scale 3D simulations</a>, a team of NVIDIA researchers proposed a neural operator architecture that combines accuracy and computational efficiency to estimate the pressure field around vehicles — the first deep learning-based computational fluid dynamics method on an industry-standard, large-scale automotive benchmark. The method achieved 100,000x acceleration on a single <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/">NVIDIA Tensor Core GPU</a> compared to another GPU-based solver, while reducing the error rate. Researchers can incorporate the model into their own applications using the open-source <a href="https://github.com/neuraloperator/neuraloperator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neuraloperator library</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67740" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1-672x390.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="390" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1-672x390.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1-400x232.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1-768x446.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1-775x450.jpg 775w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1-370x215.jpg 370w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1-172x100.jpg 172w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1.jpg 1171w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A consortium of climate scientists and machine learning researchers from universities, national labs, research institutes, Allen AI and NVIDIA collaborated on <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/73569" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClimSim</a>, a massive dataset for physics and machine learning-based climate research that will be shared in an oral presentation at NeurIPS. The dataset covers the globe over multiple years at high resolution — and machine learning emulators built using that data can be plugged into existing operational climate simulators to improve their fidelity, accuracy and precision. This can help scientists produce better predictions of storms and other extreme events.</li>
<li>NVIDIA Research interns are presenting a poster introducing an AI algorithm that provides personalized <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/71940" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predictions of the effects of medicine dosage</a> on patients. Using real-world data, the researchers tested the model’s predictions of blood coagulation for patients given different dosages of a treatment. They also analyzed the new algorithm’s predictions of the antibiotic vancomycin levels in patients who received the medication — and found that prediction accuracy significantly improved compared to prior methods.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Visual effects artist Surfaced Studio returns to 'In the NVIDIA Studio' to share his real-world VFX project, created on a brand new Razer Blade 16 Mercury Edition laptop powered by GeForce RTX 4080 graphics. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Visual effects artist Surfaced Studio returns to <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i> to share his real-world VFX project, created on a brand new <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-16/RZ09-0483TEM3-R3U1">Razer Blade 16 Mercury Edition</a> laptop powered by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4080/">GeForce RTX 4080</a> graphics.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Razer Blade 16 Mercury Edition - Real World VFX Test &amp; Review" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d6AR3XnwtIs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Surfaced Studio creates photorealistic, digitally generated imagery that seamlessly integrates visual effects into short films, television and console gaming.</p>
<p>He found inspiration for a recent sci-fi project by experimenting with 3D transitions: using a laptop screen as a gateway between worlds, like the portals from <i>Dr. Strange</i> or the transitions from <i>The Matrix</i>.</p>
<h2><b>Break the Rules and Become a Hero</b></h2>
<p>Surfaced Studio aimed to create an immersive experience with his latest project.</p>
<p>“I wanted to get my audience to feel surprised getting ‘sucked into’ the 3D world,” he explained.</p>
<p>Surfaced Studio began with a simple script, alongside sketches of brainstormed ideas and played out shots. “This usually helps me think through how I’d pull each effect off and whether they’re actually possible,” he said.</p>
<p>From there, he shot video and imported the footage into Adobe Premiere Pro for a rough test edit. Then, Surfaced Studio selected the most suitable clips for use.</p>
<p>He cleaned up the footage in Adobe After Effects, stabilizing shots with the Warp Stabilizer tool and removing distracting background elements with the Mocha Pro tool. Both effects were accelerated by his GeForce RTX 4080 Laptop GPU.</p>
<p>After, he created a high-contrast version of the shot for 3D motion tracking in Blender.</p>

<p>Motion tracking is used to apply tracking data to 3D objects. “This was pretty tricky, as it’s a 16-second gimbal shot with fast moving sections and a decent camera blur,” said Surfaced Studio. “It took me a good few days to get a decent track and fix issues with manual keyframes and ‘patches’ between different sections.”</p>

<p>Surfaced Studio exported footage of the animated camera into a 3D FBX file to use in Unreal Engine and set it up in the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/high-city-sp#">Cyberpunk High City pack</a>, which contains a modular constructor for creating highly detailed sci-fi city streets, alleys and blocks.</p>

<p>“I’m not much of a 3D artist so using [the Cyberpunk High City pack] was the best option to complete the project on this side of the century,” the artist said. He then made modifications to the cityscape, reducing flickering lights and adding buildings, custom fog and Razer and NVIDIA Studio banners. He even added a billboard with an ad encouraging kindness to cats. “It’s so off to the side of most shots I doubt anyone actually noticed,” noted a satisfied Surfaced Studio.</p>

<p>Learning 3D effects can seem overwhelming due to the vast knowledge needed across multiple apps and district workflows. But Surfaced Studio stresses the simple importance of first understanding workflow hierarchies — and how one feeds into another — as an approachable entry point to choosing a specialty suited to a creator’s unique passion and natural talent.</p>
<p>Surfaced Studio was able to seamlessly run his scene in Unreal Engine full 4K resolution — with all textures and materials loading at maximum graphical fidelity — thanks to the GeForce RTX 4080 Laptop GPU in his Razer Blade 16. The graphics card also contains <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-3-5-available-september-21/#:~:text=DLSS%203.5%20is%20available%20for,NVIDIA%20DLSS%203.5%20announcement%20article.">NVIDIA DLSS</a> capabilities to increase viewport interactivity by using AI to upscale frames rendered at lower resolution while retaining high-fidelity detail.</p>

<p>Surfaced Studio then took the FBX file with the exported camera tracking data into Unreal Engine, matching his ‘3D camera’ with the real-world one used to film the laptop with. “This was the crucial step in creating the ‘look-through’ effect I wanted,” he said.</p>
<p>Once satisfied with the look, Surfaced Studio exported all sequences from Unreal Engine as multilayer EXR files — including a Z-depth pass, a grayscale value range to create a depth-of-field effect — to separate visual elements from the 3D footage.</p>

<p>With GeForce RTX 4080 dual encoders, Surface Studio nearly halved Adobe Premiere Pro video decoding and encoding export times. Surfaced Studio has been using NVIDIA GPUs for over a decade, citing their widespread integration with commonly used tools.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA has simply done a better job than its competitors to reach out to and integrate with other companies that create creative apps,” said Surfaced Studio. “CUDA and RTX are widespread technologies that you find in most popular creative apps to accelerate workflows.”</p>
<p>When he’s not working on VFX projects, Surfaced Studio also uses his laptop to game. The Razer Blade 16 has the first dual-mode mini-LED display with two native resolutions: UHD+ at 120Hz — suited for VFX workflows — and FHD at 240Hz — ideal for gamers (or creators who like gaming).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Images such as those in Google Street View are taking on a new purpose in the hands of University of Florida Assistant Professor of Artificial Intelligence Chaofeng Wang.</p>
<p>He’s using them, along with deep learning, in a research project to automate the evaluation of urban buildings. The project aims to help governments mitigate natural disaster damage by providing the information needed for decision-makers to bolster building structures or perform post-disaster recovery.</p>
<p>After a natural disaster such as an earthquake, local governments send teams to check and evaluate building conditions. Manually done, it can take up to months to go through the full stock of a city.</p>
<p>Wang’s project uses AI to accelerate the evaluation process — cutting the time needed to a few hours. The AI model is trained using images sourced from Google Street View and local governments to assign scores to buildings based on <a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/earthquake/training/fema-p-154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) P-154 standards</a>, which provide assessment guidelines based on factors like wall material, structure type, building age and more. Wang also collaborated with the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disasterriskmanagement/brief/global-program-for-resilient-housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Bank Global Program for Resilient Housing</a> to collect images and perform annotations, which were used to improve the model.</p>
<p>The collected images are placed in a data repository. The AI model reads the repository and performs inference on the images — a process accelerated by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-a100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DGX A100</a> systems.</p>
<p>“Without NVIDIA GPUs, we wouldn’t have been able to do this,” Wang said. “They significantly accelerate the process, ensuring timely results.”</p>
<p>Wang used the DGX A100 nodes in the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/07/21/university-of-florida-nvidia-ai-supercomputer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Florida’s supercomputer, HiPerGator</a>. HiPerGator is one of the world’s fastest AI supercomputers in academia, delivering 700 petaflops of AI performance, and was built with the support of NVIDIA founder and UF alumnus Chris Malachowsky and hardware, software, training and services from NVIDIA.</p>
<p>The AI model’s output is compiled into a database that feeds into a web portal, which shows information — including the safety assessment score, building type and even roof or wall material — in a map-based format.</p>

<p>Wang’s work was funded by the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/higher-education-research/applied-research-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Applied Research Accelerator Program</a>, which supports research projects that have the potential to make a real-world impact through the deployment of NVIDIA-accelerated applications adopted by commercial and government organizations.</p>
<h2><strong>A Helping Eye</strong></h2>
<p>Wang says that the portal can serve different needs depending on the use case. To prepare for a natural disaster, a government can use predictions solely from street view images.</p>
<p>“Those are static images — one example is Google Street View images, which get updated every several years,” he said. “But that’s good enough for collecting information and getting a general understanding about certain statistics.”</p>
<p>But for rural areas or developing regions, where such images aren’t available or not frequently updated, governments can collect the images themselves. Powered by NVIDIA GPUs, the timely delivery of building assessments can help accelerate analyses.</p>
<p>Wang also suggests that with enough refinement, his research could also create ripples for the urban planning and insurance industries.</p>
<p>The project is currently being tested by a few local governments in Mexico and is garnering interest in some African, Asian and South American countries. At its current state, it can achieve over 85% accuracy in its assessment scores, per ‌FEMA P-154 standards.</p>
<h2><b>Survey of the Land</b></h2>
<p>One challenge Wang cites is the variation in urban landscapes in different countries. Different regions have their own cultural and architectural styles. Not trained on a large or diverse enough pool of images, the AI model could be thrown off by factors like paint color when performing wall material analysis. Another challenge is urban density variation.</p>
<p>“It is a very general limitation of current AI technology,” Wang said. “In order to be useful, it requires enough training data to represent the distribution of the real world, so we’re putting efforts into the data collection process to solve the generalization issue.”</p>
<p>To overcome this challenge, Wang aims to train and test the model for more cities. So far, he’s tested about eight cities in different countries.</p>
<p>“We need to generate more detailed and high-quality annotations to train the model with,” he said. “That is the way we can improve the model in the future so that it can be used more widely.”</p>
<p>Wang’s goal is to get the project to a point where it can be deployed as a service for more general industry use.</p>
<p>“We are creating application programming interfaces that can estimate and analyze buildings and households to allow seamless integration with other products,” he said. “We are also building a user-friendly application that all government agencies and organizations can use.”</p>
