										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Now’s the time to hop aboard AI, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang declared Wednesday as ServiceNow unveiled a demo of futuristic AI avatars together with NVIDIA during a keynote at the Knowledge 24 conference in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&#8220;If something is moving a million times faster every 10 years, what should you do?” Huang asked, citing rapid advancements in AI capabilities. &#8220;The first thing you should do is instead of looking at the train, from the side is … get on the train, because on the train, it&#8217;s not moving that fast.”</p>
<p>The demo — built on NVIDIA NIM inference microservices and NVIDIA <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">Avatar Cloud Engine</a>, or ACE, speech and animation generative AI technologies, all available with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software — highlighted how AI advancements support cutting-edge digital avatar communications and have the potential to revolutionize customer service interactions.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71521" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3.jpg" alt="" width="1115" height="500" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3.jpg 1115w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3-400x179.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3-672x301.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3-768x344.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3-842x378.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3-406x182.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3-188x84.jpg 188w" sizes="(max-width: 1115px) 100vw, 1115px" /></p>
<p>The demo showed a customer who was struggling with a slow internet connection interacting with a digital avatar. The AI customer service avatar comes to the rescue &#8211;  swiftly diagnoses the problem, offers an option for a faster internet connection, confirms the customer’s credit card number and upgrades their internet connection immediately.</p>
<p>The futuristic demonstration took place in front of thousands of conference attendees who were eager to learn about the latest enterprise generative AI technology advancements, which promise to empower workers across the globe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve transitioned from instruction-driven computer coding, which very few people can do, to intention-driven computing, which is connecting with somebody through intention,&#8221; Huang said during an on-stage conversation at the conference with ServiceNow Chief Operating Officer Chirantan “CJ” Desai.</p>
<p>The moment is another compelling example of the ongoing collaboration between ServiceNow and NVIDIA to explore more engaging, personal service experiences across various functions, including IT services, human resources, customer support and more.</p>
<p>The demonstration builds upon the companies’ plan to collaborate on robust, generative AI capabilities within enterprise operations and incorporates NVIDIA <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">ACE</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> microservices.</p>
<p>These avatars are designed to add a human-like touch to digital interactions, improving customer experience by providing empathetic and efficient support.</p>
<p>These include NVIDIA Riva for automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech, NVIDIA Audio2Face for facial animation, and NVIDIA Omniverse Renderer for high-quality visual output.</p>
<p>ServiceNow and NVIDIA are further exploring the use of AI avatars to provide another communication option for users who prefer visual interactions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[AI tools accelerated by NVIDIA RTX have made it easier than ever to edit and work with video. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>AI tools accelerated by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a> have made it easier than ever to edit and work with video.</p>
<p>Case in point: Blackmagic Design’s <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve">DaVinci Resolve 19</a> recently added AI features that make video editing workflows more streamlined. These new features — along with all its other AI-powered effects — get a big boost from optimization for NVIDIA RTX PCs and workstations.</p>
<p>Editors use Blackmagic Design’s DaVinci Resolve — one of the leading nonlinear video editing platforms — to bring their creative vision to life, incorporating visual effects (VFX), color correction, motion graphics and more to their high-resolution footage and audio clips.</p>
<figure id="attachment_71468" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71468" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hollywood-md.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-71468" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hollywood-md-672x313.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="313" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hollywood-md-672x313.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hollywood-md-400x186.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hollywood-md-768x357.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hollywood-md-842x392.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hollywood-md-406x189.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hollywood-md-188x87.jpg 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hollywood-md-1280x596.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hollywood-md.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-71468" class="wp-caption-text">DaVinci Resolve’s new AI tools accelerated by RTX unlock endless possibilities.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Resolve includes a large variety of built-in tools. Some are corrective in nature, letting editors match colors from two sets of footage, reframe footage after the fact or remove objects that weren’t meant to be in a shot. Others give editors the power to manipulate footage and audio in new ways, including smooth slow-motion effects and footage upscaling.</p>
<p>In the past, many of these tools required significant time and effort from users to implement. Resolve now uses AI acceleration to speed up many of these workflows, leaving more time for users to focus on creativity rather than batch processing.</p>
<p>Even better, the entire app is optimized for <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt">NVIDIA TensorRT</a> deep learning inference software to get the best performance from GPU-reliant effects and other features, boosting performance by 2x.</p>
<h2><b>New in Resolve 19</b></h2>
<p>The newest release, <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/whatsnew">DaVinci Resolve 19</a>, adds two new AI features that make video editing more efficient: the IntelliTrack AI point tracker for object tracking, stabilization and audio panning, and UltraNR, which uses AI for spatial noise reduction.</p>
<p>IntelliTrack AI makes it easy to stabilize footage during the editing process. It can also be used in Resolve’s Fairlight tool to track on-screen subjects, and automatically generate audio panning within a scene by tracking people or objects as they move across 2D and 3D spaces. With AI audio panning to video, editors can quickly pan, or move audio across the stereo field, multiple actors in a scene, controlling their voice positions in the mix environment. All of this can be done by hand, but IntelliTrack’s AI acceleration speeds up the entire process.</p>
<p><iframe title="How to use IntelliTrack Tracking in DaVinci Resolve 19" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rXsKkY_Mkb4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>UltraNR is an AI-accelerated denoise mode in Resolve’s spatial noise reduction palette. Editors can use it to dramatically reduce digital noise — undesired fluctuations of color or luminance that obscure detail — from a frame while maintaining image clarity. They can also combine the tool with temporal noise reduction for even more effective denoising in images with motion, where fluctuations can be more noticeable.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DAVINCI RESOLVE 19!! What&#039;s NEW?! You won&#039;t want to miss this!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8ENuSsScDA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Both IntelliTrack and UltraNR get a big boost when running on NVIDIA RTX PCs and workstations. TensorRT lets them run up to 3x faster on a GeForce GTX 4090 laptop vs. the Macbook Pro M3 Max.</p>
<p>In fact, all DaVinci Resolve AI effects are accelerated on RTX GPUs by NVIDIA TensorRT. The new Resolve update also includes GPU acceleration for Beauty, Edge Detect and Watercolor effects, doubling their performance on NVIDIA GPUs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>In support of President Biden’s executive order on AI, the U.S. government will use an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD to produce generative AI advances in climate science, healthcare and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The executive order, issued in October, is aimed at ensuring U.S. leadership in AI and managing its risks. MITRE, a nonprofit organization that operates federally funded research and development centers, is implementing a new <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD</a> system that will provide researchers and developers access to massive computing leaps.</p>
<p>The DGX SuperPOD will support MITRE’s Federal AI Sandbox, a platform to improve experimentation with next-generation, AI-enabled applications across federal government agencies.</p>
<p>“The recent executive order on AI encourages federal agencies to reduce barriers for AI adoptions, but agencies often lack the computing environment necessary for experimentation and prototyping,” said Charles Clancy, senior vice president and chief technology officer at MITRE. “Our new Federal AI Sandbox will help level the playing field, making the high-quality compute power needed to train and test custom AI solutions available to any agency.”</p>
<p>The Federal AI Sandbox will deliver federal agencies the computing gains needed to train large language models and other generative AI tools to develop cutting-edge applications.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD powering the sandbox is capable of an exaFLOP of AI performance to enable researchers and developers to train and deploy custom LLMs and other AI solutions at scale.</p>
<p>“MITRE’s purchase of a DGX SuperPOD will help turbocharge the U.S. federal government’s development of its AI initiatives,” said Anthony Robbins, vice president of public sector at NVIDIA. “AI has enormous potential to improve government services for citizens and solve big challenges, like transportation and cybersecurity.”</p>
<p>The supercomputing initiative comes as the White House <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/partnership-universities-teach-ai-skills/">recently unveiled plans</a>, which include NVIDIA, for a $110 million partnership to help universities teach AI skills.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Cybersecurity experts at the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/rsa-conference/">RSA Conference</a> this week will be on the hunt for ways to secure their operations in the era of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>They’ll find many of the latest tools use AI and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/">accelerated computing</a>. This intersection of security and AI is coming into focus with collaborations that companies like NVIDIA and its partners will describe at the event.</p>
<h2><b>Data Science for a Data Problem</b></h2>
<p>Machine learning is a great tool for cybersecurity because data is exploding.</p>
<p>“With more devices and users expanding the landscape to defend, cybersecurity has become a data problem; and AI is a data solution,” said David Reber, NVIDIA’s chief security officer.</p>
<p>Today, security analysts can be overwhelmed by a data tsunami. Generative AI can provide security copilots that act like filters, extracting from the firehose flow of information the context and anomalies that need a human expert’s attention.</p>
<p>Generative AI also lets security managers interrogate their data directly instead of setting rules, chasing alerts and tracking dashboards. In the age of AI, security experts will move from a command line to a conversational interface.</p>
<h2><b>AI Puts Security Context on Steroids</b></h2>
<p>This shift takes context-based security to a new level, according to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62433/">a talk</a> Reber delivered at GTC.</p>
<p>The potential is huge, but it requires work to unearth it. At GTC, Reber encouraged cybersecurity experts to begin working with AI, starting with low-risk use cases to identify and secure gaps.</p>
<p>He also provided suggestions for how to go about securing machine learning processes, saying security experts need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>secure data supply chains,</li>
<li>develop tests for securing AI models and datasets across the development lifecycle,</li>
<li>use model cards, data cards and software bills of materials to provide AI transparency and reliability,</li>
<li>participate in community testing events such as security hackathons, and</li>
<li>update policies on how to respond to AI security events.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Foundations for AI Cybersecurity</b></h2>
<p>To give users a leg up, NVIDIA provides <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/morpheus-cybersecurity">NVIDIA Morpheus</a>, a cybersecurity AI framework that filters and classifies large volumes of real-time data. Morpheus, part of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software suite, lets developers build applications that can detect spear phishing, insider threats and more.</p>
<p>Users can employ Morpheus with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/translate-your-enterprise-data-into-actionable-insights-with-nvidia-nemo-retriever/">NeMo Retriever</a>, microservices from the <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover">NVIDIA API Catalog</a> for rapidly deploying AI.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Intrinsic, a software and AI robotics company at Alphabet, has integrated NVIDIA AI and Isaac platform technologies to advance the complex field of autonomous robotic manipulation.</p>
<p>This week at the Automate trade show, in Chicago, Intrinsic is spotlighting leaps in robotic grasping and industrial scalability assisted by foundation models enabled by NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator, unlocking new value in industrial automation with AI.</p>
<p>NVIDIA <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/isaac-generative-ai-manufacturing-logistics/">unveiled Isaac Manipulator</a> at GTC in March. <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/manipulator">Isaac Manipulator</a> is a collection of foundation models and modular GPU-accelerated libraries that help industrial automation companies build scalable and repeatable workflows for dynamic manipulation tasks by accelerating AI model training and task reprogramming.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/#:~:text=Foundation%20models%20are%20AI%20neural,text%20to%20analyzing%20medical%20images.">Foundation models</a> are based on a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-transformer-model/">transformer</a> deep learning architecture that allows a neural network to learn by tracking relationships in data. They’re generally trained on huge datasets and can be used to process and understand sensor and robot information as magically as ChatGPT for text. This enables robot perception and decision-making like never before and provides zero-shot learning — the ability to perform tasks without prior examples.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s collaboration with Intrinsic, a leading robotics software and AI company,  demonstrates the potential for a universally applicable robotic-grasping skill to work across grippers, environments and objects.</p>
<p>“For the broader industry, our work with NVIDIA shows how foundation models can have a profound impact, including making today&#8217;s processing challenges easier to manage at scale, creating previously infeasible applications, reducing development costs, and increasing flexibility for end users,” said Wendy Tan White, CEO at Intrinsic, <a href="http://www.intrinsic.ai/blog/unlocking-new-value-in-industrial-automation-with-ai">in a blog post</a> announcing the collaboration with NVIDIA.  (White will deliver a keynote address at Automate about what the rise of AI means for innovation and growth, on Thursday, May 9, at 7 a.m. PT.)</p>
<h2><b>Developing Better Robot Grip With Isaac Manipulator</b></h2>
<p>Grasping has been a long sought after robotics skill. So far it’s been time-consuming, expensive to program and difficult to scale. As a result, many repetitive pick-and-place conditions haven’t been seamlessly handled to date by robots.</p>
<p>Simulation is changing that. Enlisting <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim">NVIDIA Isaac Sim</a> on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platform, Intrinsic generated <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/use-cases/synthetic-data/">synthetic data</a> for vacuum grasping using computer-aided design models of sheet metal and suction grippers. This allowed Intrinsic to create a prototype for its customer <a href="https://www.trumpf.com/en_US/products/machines-systems/">Trumpf Machine Tools</a>, a leading maker of industrial machine tools.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Smart Pick-and-Place in NVIDIA Isaac Sim" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/paLR6-hjlT8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The prototype uses Intrinsic <a href="https://intrinsic.ai/flowstate/">Flowstate</a>, a developer environment for AI-based robotics solutions, for visualizing processes, associated perception and motion planning. With a workflow that includes Isaac Manipulator, one can generate grasp poses and CUDA-accelerated robot motions, which can first be evaluated in simulation with Isaac Sim — a cost-saving step — before deployment in the real world with the Intrinsic platform.</p>
<p>Under the collaboration, NVIDIA and Intrinsic plan to bring state-of-the-art dexterity and modular AI capabilities for robotic arms, with a robust collection of foundation models and GPU-accelerated libraries to accelerate a greater number of new robotics and automation tasks.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Grasping skill, based on an Nvidia foundation model, used in Intrinsic Flowstate" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9j9G8yEXI_g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><i>On Tuesday, May 7, at 11 a.m. CT, NVIDIA Senior Research Scientist Adithya Murali and Intrinsic Chief Science Officer Torsten Kroeger will demonstrate the companies’ work in the session “Automating Smart Pick-and-Place With Intrinsic Flowstate and NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator ” in the Intrinsic booth 2808 at Automate. </i><i>Join  our </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/automate-conference/"><i>speaking sessions</i></a><i> at Automate. </i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Harnessing optimized AI models for healthcare is easier than ever as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a>, a collection of cloud-native microservices, integrates with Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p><a href="http://ai.nvidia.com/">NIM</a>, part of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform available on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ozgjkov6vq3l6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS Marketplace</a>, enables developers to access a growing library of AI models through industry-standard application programming interfaces, or APIs. The library includes <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/">foundation models</a> for drug discovery, medical imaging and genomics, backed by enterprise-grade security and support.</p>
<p>NIM is now available via Amazon SageMaker — a fully managed service to prepare data and build, train and deploy machine learning models — and AWS ParallelCluster, an open-source tool to deploy and manage high performance computing clusters on AWS. NIMs can also be orchestrated using AWS HealthOmics, a purpose-built service for biological data analysis.</p>
<p>Easy access to NIM will enable the thousands of healthcare and life sciences companies already using AWS to deploy <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> more quickly, without the complexities of model development and packaging for production. It’ll also help developers build workflows that combine AI models across different modalities, such as amino acid sequences, MRI images and plain-text patient health records.</p>
<p>Presented today at the <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/NAMER-event-T3-AWS-Life-Science-Symposium-2024-reg-event.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS Life Sciences Leader Symposium</a> in Boston, this initiative extends the availability of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/">NVIDIA Clara</a> accelerated healthcare software and services on AWS — which include fast and easy-to-deploy NIMs from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a> for drug discovery, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/monai/">NVIDIA MONAI</a> for medical imaging workflows and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/genomics/">NVIDIA Parabricks</a> for accelerated genomics.</p>
<h2><b>Pharma and Biotech Companies Adopt NVIDIA AI on AWS</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/bionemo/">BioNeMo</a> is a generative AI platform of foundation models, training frameworks, domain-specific data loaders and optimized training recipes​ that support the training and fine-tuning of biology and chemistry models on proprietary data.​ It’s used by more than 100 organizations globally.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/genomics-ai-amgen-superpod/">Amgen</a>, one of the world’s leading biotechnology companies, has used the BioNeMo framework to train generative models for protein design, and is exploring the potential use of BioNeMo with AWS.</p>
<p><i>​</i>BioNeMo models for protein structure prediction, generative chemistry and molecular docking prediction are available as NIM microservices, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-pretrained-ai-model/">pretrained</a> and optimized to run on any NVIDIA GPU or cluster of GPUs. These models can be combined to support a holistic, AI-accelerated drug discovery workflow.</p>
<p>Biotechnology company A-Alpha Bio harnesses synthetic biology and AI to measure, predict and engineer protein-to-protein interactions. When its researchers moved from a generic version of the ESM-2 protein language model to <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/bionemo-framework/latest/models/esm2-nv.html">a version optimized by NVIDIA</a> running on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> on AWS, they immediately saw a speedup of more than 10x. This lets the team sample a much more extensive field of protein candidates than they would have otherwise.</p>
<p>For organizations that want to augment these models with their own experimental data, NIM enables developers to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">enhance a model with retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG</a> — known as a lab-in-the-loop design.</p>
<h2><b>Parabricks Enables Accelerated Genomics Pipelines</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA NIM includes genomics models from NVIDIA Parabricks, which are also <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/easily-run-nvidia-parabricks-ready2run-workflows-on-amazon-omics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on AWS HealthOmics</a> as Ready2Run workflows that enable customers to deploy pre-built pipelines.</p>
<p>Life sciences company Agilent used Parabricks genomics analysis tools running on NVIDIA GPU-powered <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances</a> to significantly improve processing speeds for variant calling workflows on the company’s cloud-native <a href="https://www.agilent.com/en/product/next-generation-sequencing/clinical-informatics-platform/alissa-reporter-1947792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alissa Reporter</a> software. Integrating Parabricks with Alissa secondary analysis pipelines enables researchers to access rapid data analysis in a secure cloud environment.​</p>
<h2><b>Conversational AI Technology Supports Digital Health</b></h2>
<p>In addition to models that can decode proteins and genomic sequences, NIM microservices offer optimized <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language models</a> for conversational AI and visual generative AI models for avatars and digital humans.</p>
<p>AI-powered digital assistants can enhance healthcare by answering patient questions and supporting clinicians with logistics. Trained on healthcare organization-specific data using RAG, they could connect to relevant internal data sources to synthesize research, surface insights and improve productivity.</p>
<p>Generative AI startup <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/03/18/2848236/0/en/Hippocratic-AI-Announces-Collaboration-with-NVIDIA-to-Develop-Super-Low-Latency-Empathy-Inference-for-One-of-the-World-s-First-Generative-AI-Powered-Healthcare-Agents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hippocratic AI</a> is in the final stages of testing AI-powered healthcare agents that focus on a wide range of tasks including wellness coaching, preoperative outreach and post-discharge follow-up.</p>
<p>The company, which uses NVIDIA GPUs through AWS, is adopting NVIDIA NIM and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a> microservices to power a generative AI agent for digital health.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Always Available, Real-Time Generative AI Healthcare Agents" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yg0m8eR7k24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The team used <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/audio2face/">NVIDIA Audio2Face</a> facial animation technology, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/riva/">NVIDIA Riva</a> automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, and more to power a healthcare assistant avatar’s conversation.</p>
<p>Experiment with <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/explore/healthcare">NVIDIA NIMs for healthcare</a> and get started with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/nvidia/hcls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Clara on AWS</a>.</p>

<p>Riot Games has rolled out the <i>League of Legends</i> 14.9 update globally, which adds the Vanguard security software to the game. Since Vanguard doesn’t support virtual machines like GeForce NOW, the game is under maintenance and no longer playable on the cloud gaming platform for the foreseeable future. Work is underway to find a solution for GeForce NOW members.</p>
<p><i>Lightyear Frontier </i>(Xbox) didn’t make it in April due to technical issues. Stay tuned to GFN Thursday for updates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>YouTube robotics influencer Dave Niewinski has developed robots for everything from driveable La-Z-Boy chairs to an AI-guided cornhole tosser and horse-drawn chariot racing.</p>
<p>His recent <a href="https://www.hackster.io/davesarmoury/interactive-animatronic-glados-8b4238">Interactive Animatronic GLaDOS</a> project was among nine winners in the <a href="https://www.hackster.io/contests/SparkFun-NVIDIA-AI-Innovation-Challenge">Hackster AI Innovation Challenge</a>. About 100 contestants vied for prizes from NVIDIA and Sparkfun by creating open-source projects to advance the use of AI in edge computing, robotics and IoT.</p>
<p>Niewinski won first place in the generative AI applications category for his innovative robot based on the GLaDOS guide from game series <i>Portal</i>, the first-person puzzle platform from video game developer Valve.</p>
<p>Other top winners included contestants Andrei Ciobanu and Allen Tao, who took first prize in the generative AI models for the edge and AI at the edge applications categories, respectively. Ciobanu used generative AI to help virtually try on clothes, while Tao developed a ROS-based robot to map the inside of a home to help find things.</p>
<h2><b>Harnessing LLMs for Robots</b></h2>
<p>Niewinski builds custom applications for robotics at his <a href="https://www.armourylabs.com/">Armoury Labs</a> business in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, where he uses the NVIDIA Jetson platform for edge AI and robotics, creating open-source tutorials and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavesArmoury/videos">YouTube videos</a> following his experiences.</p>
<p>He built his interactive GLaDOS robot to create a personal assistant for himself in the lab. It handles queries using Transformer-based speech recognition, text-to-speech, and large language models (LLMs) running onboard an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin</a>, which interfaces with a robot arm and camera for interactions.</p>
<p>GLaDOS can track his whereabouts in the lab, move in different directions to face him and respond quickly to queries.</p>
<p>“I like doing things with robots that people will look at and say it’s not what they had immediately expected,” he said.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Bringing GLaDOS to life with Robotics and AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNcKTZsHyfA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>He wanted the assistant to sound like the original GLaDOS from <i>Portal</i> and respond quickly. Fortunately, the gaming company Valve has put all of the voice lines from <i>Portal </i>and <i>Portal 2</i> on its website, allowing Niewinski to download the audio to help train a model.</p>
<p>“Using Jetson, your average question-and-answer stuff runs pretty quick for speech,” he said.</p>
<p>Niewinski used NVIDIA’s open-source <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo">NeMo</a> toolkit to fine-tune a voice for GLaDOS, training a spectrogram generator network called <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/tts_en_fastpitch">FastPitch</a> and <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/tts_hifigan">HiFiGAN</a> vocoder network to refine the audio quality.</p>
<p>Both networks are deployed on Orin with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/riva/">NVIDIA Riva</a> to enable speech recognition and synthesis that’s been optimized to run at many times the real-time rate of speech, so that it can run alongside the LLM while maintaining a smooth, interactive delivery.</p>
<p>For generating realistic responses from GLaDOS, Niewinski uses a locally hosted LLM called OpenChat that he runs in Docker from <a href="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers">jetson-containers</a>, saying that it was a drop-in replacement for OpenAI’s API. All of this AI is running on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">Jetson</a> module, using the latest open-source ML software stack built with CUDA and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack">JetPack</a>.</p>
<p>To enable GLaDOS to move, Niewinski developed the interactions for a Unitree Z1 robotic arm. It has a stereo camera and models for seeing and tracking a human speaking and a 3D-printed GLaDOS head and body shell around the arm.</p>
<h2><b>Trying on Generative AI for Fashion Fit</b></h2>
<p>Winner Ciobanu, based in Romania, aimed to improve the virtual clothing try-on experience with the help of generative AI, taking a top prize for his <a href="https://www.hackster.io/andrei-ciobanu2/edgestyle-fashion-preview-at-the-edge-b6d845">EdgeStyle: Fashion Preview at the Edge</a>.</p>
<p>He used AI models such as YOLOv5, SAM and OpenPose to extract and refine data from images and videos. Then he used Stable Diffusion to generate the images, which he said was key to achieving accurate virtual try-ons.</p>
<p>This system taught the model how clothes fit different poses on people, which he said enhanced the realism of the try-ons.</p>
<p>“It’s quite handy as it allows users to see how clothes would look on them without actually trying them on,” said Ciobanu.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="EdgeStyle Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kR_o9eEUHK4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The NVIDIA JetPack SDK provided all the tools needed to run AI models smoothly on the Jetson Orin, he said.</p>
<p>“It’s super-helpful to have a stable set of tools, especially when you’re dealing with AI tech that keeps changing,” said Ciobanu. “It really cut down on the time and hassle for us developers, letting us focus more on the cool stuff we’re building instead of getting stuck on tech issues.”</p>
<h2> <b>Finding Lost Items With Robot Assistance</b></h2>
<p>Winner Tao, based in Ontario, Canada, created a robot to lessen the burden of searching for things lost around the house. His <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hackster.io%2Fceyeber%2Fan-eye-for-an-item-9162a7&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cscmartin%40nvidia.com%7C0e398a0434c949e581b508dc65b1f664%7C43083d15727340c1b7db39efd9ccc17a%7C0%7C0%7C638497062235862516%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=FiIs8uLHjF8szFOvOs5F1vHFD3ax0fKBEnLyL3kS9aQ%3D&amp;reserved=0">An Eye for an Item</a> project took top honors at the Hackster challenge.</p>
<p>“Finding lost objects is a chore, and recent developments in zero-shot object detection and LLMs make it feasible for a computer to detect arbitrary objects for us based on textual or pictorial descriptions, presenting an opportunity for automation,” said Tao.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Teleop Drive Test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dx87BFX5nA8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Tao said he needed robot computing capabilities to catalog objects in any unstructured environment — whether a living room or large warehouse. And he needed it to also perform real-time calculations for localization to help with navigation, as well as running inference on larger object detection models.</p>
<p>“Jetson Orin was a perfect fit, supporting all functionality from text and image queries into <a href="https://www.jetson-ai-lab.com/tutorial_nanodb.html">NanoDB</a>, to real-time odometry feedback, including leveraging <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/ros">Isaac ROS</a>’ hardware-accelerated AprilTag detections for drift correction,” he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Chatbots powered by large-language AI models have transformed computing, and NVIDIA ChatRTX lets users interact with their local data, accelerated by NVIDIA RTX-powered Windows PCs and workstations. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>AI Decoded series</i></a><i>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and which showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.</i></p>
<p>Chatbots powered by large-language AI models have transformed computing, and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chatrtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA ChatRTX</a> lets users interact with their local data, accelerated by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX</a>-powered Windows PCs and workstations. A <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chatrtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new update</a>, first demoed at <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-decoded-gtc-chatrtx-workbench-nim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTC</a> in March, expands the power of this RTX-accelerated chatbot app with additional features and support for new models.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA RTX Remix beta update brings NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-decoded-ray-reconstruction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ray Reconstruction</a> to the modding platform for even more impressive real-time ray tracing.</p>
<h2><b>Say It Out Loud</b></h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="ChatRTX Update: New Models &amp; Features | Voice &amp; Image Data Support" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zMROAxJQ7rk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>ChatRTX uses <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM software and NVIDIA RTX acceleration to bring chatbot capabilities to RTX-powered Windows PCs and workstations. Backed by its powerful large language models (LLMs), users can query their notes and documents with ChatRTX, which can quickly generate relevant responses, while running locally on the user’s device.</p>
<p>The latest version adds support for additional LLMs, including Gemma, the latest open, local LLM trained by Google. Gemma was developed from the same research and technology used to create the company’s Gemini models and is built for responsible AI development. ChatRTX also now supports ChatGLM3, an open, bilingual (English and Chinese) LLM based on the general language model framework.</p>
<p>Users can also interact with image data thanks to support for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training from OpenAI. CLIP is a neural network that, through training and refinement, learns visual concepts from natural language supervision — that is, the model recognizes what it’s “seeing” in image collections. With CLIP support in ChatRTX, users can interact with photos and images on their local devices through words, terms and phrases, without the need for complex metadata labeling.</p>
<p>The new ChatRTX release also lets people chat with their data using their voice. Thanks to support for Whisper, an automatic speech recognition system that uses AI to process spoken language, users can send voice queries to the application and ChatRTX will provide text responses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chatrtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download</a> ChatRTX today.</p>
<h2><b>Mix It Up</b></h2>
<p>With RTX Remix, modders can transform classic PC games into RTX remasters using AI-accelerated tools on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platform.</p>
<p>Now, they can use <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction</a> in their projects with just a few clicks, thanks to an update to RTX Remix available this week. Its advanced, AI-powered neural renderer improves the fidelity, responsiveness and quality of ray-traced effects, giving <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA GeForce RTX</a> gamers an even better experience.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Portal with RTX | DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction Comparison - Fence Scene" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kXNzDQTSFF8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>AI powers other elements of the Remix workflow, too. Modders can use generative AI texture tools to analyze low-resolution textures from classic games, generate physically accurate materials — including normal and roughness maps — and upscale the resolution by up to 4x. Tools like this also save modders time, quickly handling a task that could otherwise become tedious.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Talk about commitment. When startup SEA.AI, an NVIDIA Metropolis partner, set out to create a system that would use AI to scan the seas to enhance maritime safety, entrepreneur Raphael Biancale wasn’t afraid to take the plunge. He donned a lifejacket and jumped into the ocean.</p>
<p>It’s a move that demonstrates Biancale’s commitment and pioneering approach. The startup, founded in 2018 and based in Linz, Austria, with subsidiaries in France, Portugal and the US, had to build its first-of-its-kind training data from scratch in order to train an AI to help oceangoers of all kinds scan the seas.</p>
<p>And to do that, the company needed photos of what a person in the water looked like. That’s when Biancale, now the company’s head of research, walked the plank.</p>
<p>The company has come a long way since then, with a full product line powered by NVIDIA AI technology that lets commercial and recreational sailors detect objects on the seas, whether potential hazards or people needing rescue.</p>
<p>It’s an effort inspired by Biancale’s experience on a night sail. The lack of visibility and situational awareness illuminated the pressing need for advanced safety technologies in the maritime world that AI is bringing to the automotive industry.</p>
<p>AI, of course, is finding its way into all things aquatic. Startup <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/saildrone-autonomous-oceanic-monitoring-jetson-deepstream/">Saildrone’s autonomous sailing vessels</a> can help conduct data-gathering for science, fisheries, weather forecasting, ocean mapping and maritime security. Other researchers are using AI to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/project-ceti/">interpret whale songs</a> and even protect beachgoers from <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rip/">dangerous rip currents</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-71251 size-full" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEA-ABOVE.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="433" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEA-ABOVE.jpg 624w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEA-ABOVE-400x278.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEA-ABOVE-310x215.jpg 310w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEA-ABOVE-144x100.jpg 144w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>SEA.AI, however, promises to make the seas safer for everyone who steps aboard a boat. First introduced for ocean racing sailboats, SEA.AI’s system has quickly evolved into an AI-powered situational awareness system that can be deployed on everything from recreational sail and powerboats to commercial shipping vessels.</p>
<p>SEA.AI directly addresses one of the most significant risks for all these vessels: collisions. Thanks to SEA.AI, commercial and recreational oceangoers worldwide can travel with more confidence.</p>
<h2>How SEA.AI Works</h2>
<p>At the heart of SEA.AI’s approach is a proprietary database of over 9 million annotated marine objects which is growing constantly.</p>
<p>When combined with high-tech optical sensors and the latest AI technology from NVIDIA, SEA.AI’s systems can recognize and classify objects in real-time, significantly improving maritime safety.</p>
<p>SEA.AI technology can detect a person in water up to 700 meters — almost half a mile — away, a dinghy up to 3,000 meters, and motorboats up to 7,500 meters.</p>
<p>This capability ensures maritime operators can identify hazards before they pose a threat. It complements older marine safety systems that rely on radar and satellite signals.</p>
<p>SEA.AI solutions integrate with central marine display units from industry-leading manufacturers like Raymarine, B&amp;G, Garmin and Furuno as well as Android and iOS-based mobile devices. This provides broad applicability across the maritime sector, from recreational vessels to commercial and government ships.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a> edge AI platform is integral to SEA.AI’s success. The platform for robotics and embedded computing applications enables SEA.AI products to achieve unparalleled processing power and efficiency, setting a new standard in maritime safety by quickly detecting, analyzing and alerting operators to objects.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-71255 size-full" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEAAI-GEAR.png" alt="" width="624" height="284" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEAAI-GEAR.png 624w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEAAI-GEAR-400x182.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEAAI-GEAR-406x185.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEAAI-GEAR-188x86.png 188w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<h2>AI Integration and Real-Time Object Detection</h2>
<p>SEA.AI uses NVIDIA’s AI and machine vision technology to offer real-time object detection and classification, providing maritime operators with immediate identification of potential hazards.</p>
<p>SEA.AI is bringing its approach to oceangoers of all kinds with three product lines.</p>
<p>One, SEA.AI Sentry, provides 360-degree situational awareness for commercial vessels and motor yachts with features like collision avoidance, object tracking and perimeter surveillance.</p>
<p>Another, SEA.AI Offshore,  provides bluewater sailors with high-tech safety and convenience with simplified installation across several editions that can suit different detection and technical needs.</p>
<p>The third, SEA.AI Competition, offers reliable object detection for ocean racing and performance yacht sailors. Its ultra-lightweight design ensures maximum performance when navigating at high speeds.</p>
<p>With a growing team of more than 60 and a distribution network spanning over 40 countries, SEA.AI is charting a course to help ensure every journey on the waves is safer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[OpenUSD integration into Siemens technologies powers a new wave of industrial digitalization.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/news/"><i>Into the Omniverse</i></a><i>, a series focused on how artists, developers and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advances in </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>OpenUSD</i></a><i> and </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>NVIDIA Omniverse</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description</a>, aka OpenUSD, is elevating the manufacturing game. Siemens, a leader in industrial technology, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/industrial-sector/siemens/">has embraced OpenUSD</a> as a cornerstone of its digital transformation journey, using it to help bridge the gap between physical and virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Siemens is adding support for <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/siemens-immersive-visualization-generative-ai/">OpenUSD in its Siemens Xcelerator</a> platform applications, starting with <a href="https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/teamcenter/teamcenter-x-cloud-plm/"><span>Teamcenter X software</span></a>.</p>
<p>The integration empowers manufacturers to create photorealistic, robust <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-twin/">digital twins</a> that mirror real-world counterparts with unprecedented fidelity and efficiency. This allows for optimized resource utilization, minimized waste and enhanced product quality through comprehensive simulation and analysis — all of which align with sustainability and quality objectives.</p>
<p>For a company such as Siemens — one whose software touches all parts of the manufacturing cycle — digitalization can <span>mean helping customers save time and costs</span>, streamline workflows and reduce risk of manufacturing defects.</p>
<p>Ian Fisher, a member of <a href="https://www.sw.siemens.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siemens Digital Industries Software</a> team, is no stranger to the impact of embracing digital transformation — especially one powered by OpenUSD and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20enables%20users%20to,on%20a%20variety%20of%20inputs.">generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>“We are an industrial company where data is king,” he said. “OpenUSD comes in from the media side of the world, and we are looking to bring its openness and flexibility into the industrial world.”</p>
<p>Enterprises of all sizes depend on Siemens’ Teamcenter software, part of the Siemens Xcelerator platform, to develop and deliver products at scale. By connecting <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> — a platform of APIs and services based on OpenUSD — with Teamcenter X, Siemens’ cloud-based product lifecycle management software, engineering teams can make their physics-based digital twins more photorealistic and immersive, improving accuracy and minimizing waste and errors within workflows.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-71329 aligncenter" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ss060_comp_v01-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif" alt="" width="600" height="360" /></p>
<p>Siemens’ adoption of OpenUSD means that companies like <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/siemens-immersive-visualization-generative-ai/">HD Hyundai</a>, a leader in sustainable ship manufacturing, can consolidate and visualize complex engineering projects directly within Teamcenter X. Find out more in the demo:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Siemens Teamcenter X Powered by NVIDIA Omniverse APIs" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrb2tPHiLRo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>OpenUSD is touching other parts of Siemens as well. Siemens produces inverters, drive controllers and motors for more than 30,000 customers worldwide. Its lead electronics plant, <a href="https://assets.new.siemens.com/siemens/assets/api/uuid:50b2232d-7c93-4684-99af-2d532a52de9b/4681-SIE-BRO-GWE-Fly-A4-One-Pager-3_original.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GWE</a>, in Erlangen, Germany, has been developing use cases from AI-enabled computer vision for <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/siemens-omniverse-replicator-aws-synthetic-data-generation/">defect detection</a> to training pick-and-place robots.</p>
<p>One of their main challenges has been acquiring data to train the AI models that fuel these use cases. By building custom<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/"> synthetic data generation</a> pipelines using Omniverse Replicator, powered by OpenUSD, the engineers were able to generate large sets of diverse training data by varying many parameters including color, texture, background, lighting and more — allowing them to not only bootstrap but also quickly iterate on their AI models.</p>
<p>Committed to a future of widespread OpenUSD integration, Siemens was one of <a href="https://aousd.org/news/alliance-for-openusd-introduces-new-working-groups-and-liaison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight new general members</a> that joined the <a href="https://aousd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alliance for OpenUSD (AOUSD)</a> last month, an organization dedicated to interoperability of 3D content through standardization.</p>
<p>Watch Fisher and other special guests discuss the impact of OpenUSD on industrial digitization workflows in this livestream replay:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>To address the shift to electric vehicles, increased semiconductor demand, manufacturing onshoring, and ambitions for greater sustainability, manufacturers are investing in new factory developments and re-engineering their existing facilities.</p>
<p>These projects often run over budget and schedule, due to complex and manual planning processes, legacy technology infrastructure, and disconnected tools, data and teams.</p>
<p>Virtual factories and digitalization address these challenges, and manufacturers are embracing them. A virtual factory, powered by technologies like <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-twin/">digital twins, the </a><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)</a><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-twin/"> ecosystem</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>, can enable new possibilities, from planning to operations.</p>
<h2>What Is a Virtual Factory?</h2>
<p>A virtual factory is a physically accurate representation of a real factory. These digital twins of factories allow manufacturers to model, simulate, analyze and optimize their production processes, resources and operations without the need for a physical prototype or pilot plant.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Virtual Factories</h2>
<p>Virtual factories unlock many benefits and possibilities for manufacturers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Streamlined Communication: </b>Instead of teams relying on in-person meetings and static planning documents for project alignment, virtual factories streamline communication and ensure that critical design and operations decisions are informed by the most current data.</li>
<li><b>Contextualized Planning</b>: During facility design, construction and commissioning, virtual factories allow project stakeholders to visualize designs in the context of the entire facility and production process. Planning and operations teams can compare and verify built structures with the virtual designs in real time and decrease costs by identifying errors and incorporating feedback early in the review process.</li>
<li><b>Optimized Facility Designs: </b>Connecting virtual factories to simulations of processes and discrete events enables teams to optimize facility designs for production and material flow, ergonomic work design, safety and overall utilization.</li>
<li><b>Intelligent and Optimized Operations: </b>Operations teams can integrate their virtual factories with valuable production data from Internet of Things technology at the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-edge-computing/">edge</a>, and tap AI to drive further optimizations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Virtual Factories: A Testing Ground for AI and Robotics</h2>
<p>Robotics developers are increasingly using virtual factories to train and test AI and autonomous systems that run in physical factories. For example, virtual factories can enable developers and manufacturing teams to simulate digital workers and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/isaac-amr-nova-orin-autonomous-mobile-robots/">autonomous mobile robots</a> (AMRs), vision AI agents and sensors to create a centralized map of worker activity throughout a facility. By fusing data from simulated camera streams with multi-camera tracking, developers can generate occupancy maps that inform optimal AMR routes.</p>
<p>Developers can also use these physically accurate virtual factories to train and test AI agents capable of managing their robot fleets, to ensure AI-enabled robots can adapt to real-world unpredictability and to identify streamlined configurations for human-robot collaboration.</p>

<h2>What Are the Foundations of a Virtual Factory</h2>
<p>Building large-scale, physically accurate virtual factories that unlock these transformational possibilities requires bringing together many tools, data formats and technologies to harmonize the representation of real-world aspects in the digital world.</p>
<p>Originally invented by Pixar Animation Studios, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">OpenUSD</a> encompasses a collection of tools and capabilities that enable the data interoperability developers and manufacturers require to achieve their digitalization goals.</p>
<p>OpenUSD’s core superpower is flexible data modeling. 3D input can be accepted from source applications and combined with a variety of data, including from computer-aided design software, live sensors, documentation and maintenance records, through a unified data pipeline. OpenUSD enables developers to share these data types across different simulation tools and AI models, providing insights for all stakeholders. Data can be synced from the factory floor to the digital twin, surfacing real-time insights for factory managers and teams.</p>
<p>By developing virtual factory solutions on OpenUSD, developers can enhance collaboration for factory teams, allowing them to review plans, discuss optimization opportunities and make decisions in real time.</p>
<p>To support and accelerate the development of the OpenUSD ecosystem, Pixar, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk and NVIDIA formed the <a href="https://aousd.org/">Alliance for OpenUSD</a>, which is building open standards for USD in core specification, materials, geometry and more.</p>
<h2>Industrial Use Cases for Virtual Factories</h2>
<p>To unlock the potential of virtual factories, industry leaders including Autodesk, Continental, Pegatron, Rockwell Automation, Siemens and Wistron are developing virtual-factory solutions that interoperate with OpenUSD and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform of application programming interfaces (APIs) and software development kits that enable developers to build applications for complex 3D and industrial digitalization workflows based on OpenUSD.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62639/">FlexSim</a>, an Autodesk company, uses OpenUSD to enable factory teams to analyze, visualize and optimize real-world processes with its simulation modeling for complex systems and operations. The discrete-event simulation software provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to create 3D simulation models, account for real-world variability, run “what-if” scenarios and perform in-depth analyses.</p>
<p>Developers at <a href="https://www.continental.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continental</a>, a leading German automotive technology company, developed <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62919/">ContiVerse</a>, a factory planning and manufacturing operations application on OpenUSD and NVIDIA Omniverse. The application helps Continental optimize factory layouts and plan production processes collaboratively, leading to an expected 13% reduction in time to market.<a href="https://www.pegatroncorp.com/"> </a></p>
<p>Partnering with IT consulting and digital services provider <a href="https://www.softserveinc.com/en-us">SoftServe</a>, Continental also developed <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s61799/">Industrial Co-Pilot</a>, which combines AI-driven insights with immersive visualization to deliver real-time guidance and predictive analytics to engineers. This is expected to reduce maintenance effort and downtime by 10%.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pegatroncorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pegatron</a>, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of smartphones and consumer electronics, is <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62553/">developing virtual-factory solutions</a> on OpenUSD to accelerate the development of new factories — as well as to minimize change orders, optimize operations and maximize production-line throughput in existing facilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62623/">Rockwell Automation</a> is integrating NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud APIs and OpenUSD with its <a href="https://www.demo3d.com/">Emulate3D</a> digital twin software to bring manufacturing teams data interoperability, live collaboration and physically based visualization for designing, building and operating industrial-scale digital twins of production systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siemens</a>, a leading technology company for automation, digitalization and sustainability and a member of the Alliance for OpenUSD, is adopting Omniverse Cloud APIs within its Siemens Xcelerator Platform, starting with Teamcenter X, the industry-leading cloud-based product lifecycle management software. This will help teams design, build and test next-generation products, manufacturing processes and factories virtually, before they’re built in the physical world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wistron.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wistron</a>, a leading global technology service provider and electronics manufacturer, is <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62600/">digitalizing new and existing factories</a> with OpenUSD. By developing virtual-factory solutions on NVIDIA Omniverse, Wistron enables its factory teams to collaborate remotely to refine layout configurations, optimize surface mount technology and in-circuit testing lines, and transform product-on-dock testing.</p>
<p>With these solutions, Wistron has achieved a 51% boost in worker efficiency and 50% reduction in production process times. Layout optimization and real-time monitoring have decreased defect rates by 40%. And construction time on Wistron’s new <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-platform/">NVIDIA DGX</a> factory was cut in half, from about five months to just two and a half months.</p>
