										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Silicon Valley’s Figure has taken the wraps off of its next-generation Figure 02 conversational humanoid robot that taps into <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> and NVIDIA GPUs for fully autonomous tasks.</p>
<p>Figure said it recently tested Figure 02 for data collection and use-case training at BMW Group’s Spartanburg, South Carolina, production line.</p>
<p>Figure 02 comes just 10 months after Figure launched the first version of its general-purpose humanoid robot. The company has accelerated its development timeline using <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim">NVIDIA Isaac Sim</a> — a reference application built on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform — to design, train and test AI-based robots using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/use-cases/synthetic-data/">synthetic data</a>, as well as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA GPUs</a> to train <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> models.</p>
<p>“Our rapid progress, marked by advances in speech, vision, dexterity and computational power, brings us closer to delivering humanoid robots to address labor shortages for many industries,” said Brett Adcock, CEO of Figure.</p>
<p>The company added a second NVIDIA RTX GPU-based module on board Figure 02, which supplies 3x inference gains for handling fully autonomous real-world AI tasks compared with the robot’s first iteration.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Figure 02" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0SRVJaOg9Co?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Figure aims to commercialize industrial humanoid robots to address labor shortages, and it plans to produce consumer versions.</p>
<p>Founded in 2022, the startup is partnered with OpenAI to develop custom AI models, trained on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, that drive the robots’ conversational AI capabilities. Figure recently raised $675 million in funding from leading technology companies including NVIDIA.</p>
<p>“Developing autonomous humanoid robots requires the fusion of three computers: NVIDIA DGX for AI training, NVIDIA Omniverse for simulation and NVIDIA Jetson in the robot,” said Deepu Talla, vice president of robotics and edge computing at NVIDIA. “Leading companies, including  Figure, are tapping into the NVIDIA robotics stack, from edge to cloud, to drive innovation in humanoid robotics.”</p>

<h2><b>Robotic Hands Capable of Handling Real-World Tasks</b></h2>
<p>New human-scale hands, six RGB cameras, and perception AI models trained with synthetic data generated in Isaac Sim enable Figure 02 to perform high-precision pick-and-place tasks required for smart manufacturing applications.</p>
<p>Figure is among the initial members to join the new <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/humanoid-robot-program/">NVIDIA Humanoid Robot Developer Program</a>, which provides early access to <a target="_blank" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-accelerates-worldwide-humanoid-robotics-development">the latest tools and computing technologies</a> for humanoid robot development. This includes the latest releases of NVIDIA Isaac Sim, <a target="_blank" href="https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/">Isaac Lab</a>,<a target="_blank" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-accelerates-worldwide-humanoid-robotics-development"> NIM microservices (RoboCasa and MimicGen)</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/osmo">OSMO</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/foundation-model-isaac-robotics-platform">Jetson Thor</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/project-gr00t">Project GR00T</a> general-purpose humanoid foundation models.</p>
<p>Figure is a member of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/startups/?nvid=nv-int-tblg-295718-vt33" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Inception</a> program for cutting-edge startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>High school student Selin Alara Ornek is looking ahead — using machine learning and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a> platform for edge AI and robotics to create robot guide dogs for the visually impaired.</p>
<p>The project, called <a target="_blank" href="https://selinoid.com/projects/ic4uver1/">IC4U</a>, is one of seven robots Ornek has created to date, including a school aid robot, named <a target="_blank" href="https://selinoid.com/projects/bb4all/">BB4All</a>, that can help prevent bullying with real-time notification and health-monitoring capabilities.</p>
<h2><b>About the Maker</b></h2>
<p>A high school senior from Istanbul, Turkey, Ornek has always had a passion for the intersection of AI, social good and robotics. She’s a self-taught robotics developer — in building IC4U, she used the Jetson Developer Kit as a sandbox to explore and experiment.</p>
<p>She is a member of <a target="_blank" href="https://ai-4-all.org/">AI4ALL</a>, a nonprofit program with the mission to make AI more diverse and inclusive, and the New York Academy of Science. A global presence in the robotics scene, she’s been recognized at the European Youth Awards and Women in Tech Global Awards events. She placed first in the 2021 Istanbul Bosphorus Robot Cup and third at the 2023 OpenCV AI Competition.</p>
<h2><b>Her Inspiration</b></h2>
<p>Ornek’s inspiration for creating IC4U came from a trip to France, where she saw a guide dog assisting its owner. Her late dog, Korsan, was also a key source of inspiration.</p>
<p>“I started to think about if a visually impaired person lost their dog, not only would they lose their best friend, but their eyes,” Ornek said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-73519 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/selinornekproject-401x500.jpg" alt="" width="401" height="500" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/selinornekproject-401x500.jpg 401w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/selinornekproject-321x400.jpg 321w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/selinornekproject-768x957.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/selinornekproject-1233x1536.jpg 1233w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/selinornekproject-361x450.jpg 361w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/selinornekproject-173x215.jpg 173w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/selinornekproject-80x100.jpg 80w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/selinornekproject-1280x1594.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/selinornekproject.jpg 1605w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /></p>
<p>The project was built to offer the visually impaired a companion not limited by aging and health.</p>
<h2><b>Her Jetson Project</b></h2>
<p>Ornek initially used ultrasonic sensors located in IC4U’s eyes to detect obstacles. But after attending the 2021 World Summit AI as a panelist, she decided to develop new AI applications for the robot dog that’d enable it to mimic a real one.</p>
<p>The ultrasonic sensors only offered object detection from directly in front of IC4U, and Ornek wanted to expand detection to the robot’s entire surroundings.</p>
<p>The solution was using sound sensors located in the robot’s ears. IC4U can turn toward a sound and process visual information gathered by an integrated ZED 2i Wide-Angle 3D AI camera, which captures a wider range of visual data and helps detect information such as the size and speed of an object.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="IC4U3 Shorts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL4b78FeKKZAjzz9D5VbUhbeUwWonnAsK0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>“To power the ZED 2i camera and for high-quality image processing, I used an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/product-development/">NVIDIA Jetson Nano</a> developer kit,” Ornek said. “I was so impressed with the ZED 2i camera’s performance that I didn’t want to limit its use to a simple object-recognition task.”</p>
<p>She began to think of other ways that IC4U could assist a visually impaired person. IC4U’s improved data processing from high-resolution sensors, powered by Jetson, enables it to detect city objects such as stop signs, traffic light colors and the denomination of paper money.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="iC4U3 Shorts: Demo 10 Traffic Lights Color Detection" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KgxXRvYVTQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In addition, Ornek used the Jetson Nano to add a shopping feature to IC4U via web scraping from publicly available resources, aiming to one day expand it by partnering with online retail stores.</p>
<h2><b>Back to School</b></h2>
<p>In the long run, Ornek hopes to deploy IC4U for use in smart cities and spaces — continuing her exploration of AI applications with next-generation platforms like Jetson Orin.</p>
<p>This fall, she’ll begin studying computer science at the University of British Columbia on a full scholarship, as a recipient of the Karen McKellin International Leader of Tomorrow Award. She strives to encourage other youth, especially girls, that technology is fun.</p>

<h2><b>There’s a Creative App for That</b></h2>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-codec-sdk">NVIDIA NVENC</a> video encoder is built into every RTX graphics card, offloading the compute-intensive task of video encoding from the CPU to a dedicated part of the GPU.</p>
<p>CyberLink PowerDirector, a popular video editing program that recently added support for <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-ai-pc-studio-computex/">RTX Video HDR</a>, now has a setting to increase HEVC with NVIDIA NVENC HEVC Ultra-High-Quality mode.</p>
<p>The new functionality reduces bit rates and improves encoding efficiency by 10%, significantly boosting video quality. Using the custom setting, content creators can offer audiences superior viewing experiences.</p>

<p>Alpha exporting allows users to add overlay effects to videos by exporting HEVC video with an alpha channel. This technique can be used to create transparent backgrounds and rapidly process animated overlays, making it ideal for creating social media content.</p>
<p>With an alpha channel, users can export HEVC videos up to 8x faster compared with run-length encoding supported by other processors, and with a 100x reduction in file size.</p>
<p>Adobe Substance 3D Modeler, a multisurface 3D sculpting tool for artists, virtual effects specialists and designers, released Block to Stock, an AI-powered, geometry-based feature for accelerating the prototyping of complex shapes.</p>
<p>It allows rough 3D shapes to be quickly replaced with pre-existing, similarly shaped 3D models that have greater detail. The result is a highly detailed shape crafted in no time.</p>
<p>The recently released version 20.5 of SideFX: Houdini, a 3D procedural software for modeling, animation and lighting, introduced <a target="_blank" href="https://raytracing-docs.nvidia.com/optix8/index.html">NVIDIA OptiX 8</a> and NVIDIA’s <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/improve-shader-performance-and-in-game-frame-rates-with-shader-execution-reordering/">Shader Execution Reordering</a> feature to its Karma XPU renderer — exclusively on NVIDIA RTX GPUs.</p>
<p>With these additions, computationally intensive tasks can now be executed up to 4x faster on RTX GPUs.</p>
<p>Topaz Video AI Pro, a photo and video enhancement software for noise reduction, sharpening and upscaling, added <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt-getting-started">TensorRT acceleration</a> for multi-GPU configurations, enabling parallelization across multiple GPUs for supercharged rendering speeds — up to 2x faster with two GPUs over a single GPU system, with further acceleration in systems with additional GPUs.</p>

<h2><b>Virtual Cultural Sites to G(r)eek Out About</b></h2>
<p>Anyone can now explore over 30 Greek cultural sites in virtual reality, thanks to the immersive work of Stavros Liaskos, managing director of visual communications company <a target="_blank" href="https://reyelise.co.uk/">Reyelise</a>.</p>
<p>“Many historical and religious sites are at risk due to environmental conditions, neglect and socio-political issues,” he said. “By creating detailed 3D replicas, we’re helping to ensure their architectural splendor is preserved digitally for future generations.”</p>
<p>Liaskos dedicated the project to his father, who passed away last year.</p>
<p>“He taught me the value of patience and instilled in me the belief that nothing is unattainable,” he said. “His wisdom and guidance continue to inspire me every day.”</p>
<p>Churches are architecturally complex structures. To create physically accurate 3D models of them, Liaskos used the advanced real-time rendering capabilities of Omniverse, connected with a slew of content-creation apps.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Church of Saint Konstantinos(3D Video)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eqTv9FTiIh8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The OpenUSD framework enabled a seamless workflow across the various apps Liaskos used. For example, after using Trimble X7 for highly accurate 3D scanning of structures, Liaskos easily moved to Autodesk 3ds Max and Blender for modeling and animation.</p>
<p>Then, with ZBrush, he sculpted intricate architectural details on the models and refined textures with Adobe Photoshop and Substance 3D. It was all brought together in Omniverse for real-time lighting and rendering.</p>

<p>For post-production work, like adding visual effects and compiling rendered scenes, Liaskos used OpenUSD to transfer his projects to Adobe After Effects, where he finalized the video output. Nearly every element of his creative workflow was accelerated by his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a4500/">NVIDIA RTX A4500 GPU. </a></p>

<p>Liaskos also explored developing <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-extended-reality/">extended reality</a> (XR) applications that allow users to navigate his 3D projects in real time in virtual reality (VR).</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-73484-1" width="1280" height="740" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/studio-itns-stavros-liaskos-wk121-agios-eleftherios-2-1280w.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/studio-itns-stavros-liaskos-wk121-agios-eleftherios-2-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/studio-itns-stavros-liaskos-wk121-agios-eleftherios-2-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, he used laser scanning and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-photogrammetry/">photogrammetry</a> to capture the detailed geometries and textures of the churches.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-73484-2" width="1280" height="740" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/studio-itns-stavros-liaskos-wk121-agios-eleftherios-1-1280w.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/studio-itns-stavros-liaskos-wk121-agios-eleftherios-1-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/studio-itns-stavros-liaskos-wk121-agios-eleftherios-1-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, he tapped Autodesk 3ds Max and Maxon ZBrush for retopology, ensuring the models were optimized for real-time rendering without compromising detail.</p>
<p>After importing them into NVIDIA Omniverse with OpenUSD, Liaskos packaged the XR scenes so they could be streamed to VR headsets  using either the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/create-xr/latest/index.html">NVIDIA Omniverse Create XR</a> spatial computing app or Unity Engine, enabling immersive viewing experiences.</p>
<p>“This approach will even more strikingly showcase the architectural beauty and cultural significance of these sites,” Liaskos said. “The simulation must be as good as possible to recreate the overwhelming, impactful feeling of calm and safety that comes with visiting a deeply spiritual space.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>In celebration of <a href="https://zoox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoox</a>’s 10th anniversary, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang recently joined the robotaxi company’s CEO, Aicha Evans, and its cofounder and CTO, Jesse Levinson, to discuss the latest in autonomous vehicle (AV) innovation and experience a ride in the Zoox robotaxi.</p>
<p>In a fireside chat at Zoox’s headquarters in Foster City, Calif., the trio reflected on the two companies’ decade of collaboration. Evans and Levinson highlighted how Zoox pioneered the concept of a robotaxi purpose-built for ride-hailing and created groundbreaking innovations along the way, using NVIDIA technology.</p>
<p>“The world has never seen a robotics company like this before,” said Huang. “Zoox started out solely as a sustainable robotics company that delivers robots into the world as a fleet.”</p>
<p>Since 2014, Zoox has been on a mission to create fully autonomous, bidirectional vehicles purpose-built for ride-hailing services. This sets it apart in an industry largely focused on retrofitting existing cars with self-driving technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-73440" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1-672x448.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="448" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1-672x448.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1-675x450.jpg 675w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1-323x215.jpg 323w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>A decade later, the company is operating <a href="https://zoox.com/vehicle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its robotaxi</a>, powered by NVIDIA GPUs, on public roads.</p>
<h2><b>Computing at the Core</b></h2>
<p>Zoox robotaxis are, at their core, supercomputers on wheels. They’re built on multiple NVIDIA GPUs dedicated to processing the enormous amounts of data generated in real time by their sensors.</p>
<p>The sensor array includes cameras, lidar, radar, long-wave infrared sensors and microphones. The onboard computing system rapidly processes the raw sensor data collected and fuses it to provide a coherent understanding of the vehicle’s surroundings.</p>
<p>The processed data then flows through a <a href="https://zoox.com/journal/perception/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception engine</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/how-the-zoox-robotaxi-predicts-everything-everywhere-all-at-once" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prediction module</a> to <a href="https://zoox.com/journal/planner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning</a> and control systems, enabling the vehicle to navigate complex urban environments safely.</p>
<p>NVIDIA GPUs deliver the immense computing power required for the Zoox robotaxis’ autonomous capabilities and continuous learning from new experiences.</p>
<h2><b>Using Simulation as a Virtual Proving Ground</b></h2>
<p>Key to Zoox’s AV development process is its extensive use of simulation. The company uses NVIDIA GPUs and software tools to run a wide array of simulations, testing its autonomous systems in virtual environments before real-world deployment.</p>
<p>These simulations range from synthetic scenarios to replays of real-world scenarios created using data collected from test vehicles. Zoox uses retrofitted Toyota Highlanders equipped with the same sensor and compute packages as its robotaxis to gather driving data and validate its autonomous technology.</p>
<p>This data is then fed back into simulation environments, where it can be used to create countless variations and replays of scenarios and agent interactions.</p>
<p>Zoox also uses what it calls “adversarial simulations,” carefully crafted scenarios designed to test the limits of the autonomous systems and uncover potential edge cases.</p>
<p>The company’s comprehensive approach to simulation allows it to rapidly iterate and improve its autonomous driving software, bolstering AV safety and performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-73443 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1-672x368.png" alt="" width="672" height="368" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1-672x368.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1-400x219.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1-768x420.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1-822x450.png 822w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1-393x215.png 393w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1-183x100.png 183w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1.png 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>“We’ve been using NVIDIA hardware since the very start,” said Levinson. “It’s a huge part of our simulator, and we rely on NVIDIA GPUs in the vehicle to process everything around us in real time.”</p>
<h2><b>A Neat Way to Seat</b></h2>
<p>Zoox’s robotaxi, with its unique bidirectional design and <a href="https://zoox.com/journal/robotaxi-carriage-seating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carriage-style seating</a>, is optimized for autonomous operation and passenger comfort, eliminating traditional concepts of a car’s “front” and “back” and providing equal comfort and safety for all occupants.</p>
<p>“I came to visit you when you were zero years old, and the vision was compelling,” Huang said, reflecting on Zoox’s evolution over the years. “The challenge was incredible. The technology, the talent — it is all world-class.”</p>
<p>Using NVIDIA GPUs and tools, Zoox is poised to redefine urban mobility, pioneering a future of safe, efficient and sustainable autonomous transportation for all.</p>
<h2><b>From Testing Miles to Market Projections</b></h2>
<p>As the AV industry gains momentum, recent projections highlight the potential for explosive growth in the robotaxi market. <a href="https://guidehouseinsights.com/reports/what-is-the-pathway-to-sustainability-for-as-a-service-business-models-in-transportation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidehouse Insights</a> forecasts over 5 million robotaxi deployments by 2030, with numbers expected to surge to almost 34 million by 2035.</p>
<p>The regulatory landscape reflects this progress, with 38 companies currently holding valid permits to test AVs with safety drivers in California. Zoox is currently one of only six companies permitted to test AVs without safety drivers in the state.</p>
<p>As the industry advances, Zoox has created a next-generation robotaxi by combining cutting-edge onboard computing with extensive simulation and development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>NVIDIA researchers used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/picasso/">NVIDIA Edify</a>, a multimodal architecture for visual generative AI, to build a detailed 3D desert landscape within a few minutes in a live demo at SIGGRAPH’s <a target="_blank" href="https://s2024.siggraph.org/program/real-time-live/">Real-Time Live</a> event on Tuesday.</p>
<p>During the event — one of the prestigious graphics conference’s top sessions — NVIDIA researchers showed how, with the support of an AI agent, they could build and edit a desert landscape from scratch within five minutes. The live demo highlighted how generative AI can act as an assistant to artists by accelerating ideation and generating custom secondary assets that would otherwise have been sourced from a repository.</p>
<p>By drastically decreasing ideation time, these AI technologies will empower 3D artists to be more productive and creative — giving them the tools to explore concepts faster and expedite parts of their workflows. They could, for example, generate the background assets or 360 HDRi environments that the scene needs in minutes, instead of spending hours finding or creating them.</p>
<h2><b>From Idea to 3D Scene in Three Minutes</b></h2>
<p>Creating a full 3D scene is a complex, time-consuming task. Artists must support their hero asset with plenty of background objects to create a rich scene, then find an appropriate background and an environment map to light it. Due to time constraints, they’ve often had to make a trade-off between rapid results and creative exploration.</p>
<p>With the support of AI agents, creative teams can achieve both goals: quickly bring concepts to life and continue iterating to achieve the right look.</p>
<p>In the Real-Time Live demo, the researchers used an AI agent to instruct an NVIDIA Edify-powered model to generate dozens of 3D assets, including cacti, rocks and the skull of a bull — with previews produced in just seconds.</p>
<p>They next directed the agent to harness other models to create potential backgrounds and a layout of how the objects would be placed in the scene — and showcased how the agent could adapt to last-minute changes in creative direction by quickly swapping the rocks for gold nuggets.</p>
<p>With a design plan in place, they prompted the agent to create full-quality assets and render the scene as a photorealistic image in <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/composer/latest/index.html">NVIDIA Omniverse USD Composer</a>, an app for virtual world-building.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>In a highly anticipated fireside chat at SIGGRAPH 2024, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang and Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed the transformative potential of open source AI and AI assistants.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg kicked off the discussion by announcing the launch of <a target="_blank" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/create-your-own-custom-ai-with-ai-studio/">AI Studio</a>, a new platform that allows users to create, share and discover AI characters, making AI more accessible to millions of creators and small businesses.</p>
<p>“Every single restaurant, every single website will probably, in the future, have these AIs …” Huang said.</p>
<p>“&#8230;just like every business has an email address and a website and a social media account, I think, in the future, every business is going to have an AI,” Zuckerberg responded.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg has gotten it right before. Huang credited Zuckerberg and Meta with being leaders in AI, even if only some have noticed until recently.</p>
<p>“You guys have done amazing AI work,” Huang said, citing advancements from Meta in computer vision, language models, real-time translation. “We all use Pytorch, that comes out of Meta.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-cmMcMZoZ4?si=n6m8GTto3u69RW1_" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
<b>The Importance of Open Source in Advancing AI</b><b><br />
</b><br />
Zuckerberg highlighted the importance of open source in advancing AI — with the two business leaders emphasizing the importance of open platforms for innovation. <b><br />
</b><br />
Meta has rapidly emerged as a leader in AI, putting it to work throughout its businesses — most notably with Meta AI, which is used across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — and advancing open-source AI throughout the industry, most recently with the release of Llama 3.1.</p>
<p>The open-source model represents a significant investment of time and training resources. The largest version of Llama boasts 405 billion parameters and was trained on over 16,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs.</p>
<p>“One of the things that drives quality improvements is it used to be that you have a different model for each type of content,” Zuckerberg explained.</p>
<p>“As the models get bigger and more general, that gets better and better. So, I kind of dream of one day like you can almost imagine all of Facebook or Instagram being like a single AI model that has unified all these different content types and systems together,” he added.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg sees collaboration as key to more advancements. In a blog post released last week, Zuckerberg wrote that the release of Llama 3.1 promises to be an “inflection point” in adopting open source in AI.</p>
<p>These advancements promise more tools to foster engagement, create compelling and personalized content — such as digital avatars — and build virtual worlds.</p>
<p>More broadly, the advancement of AI across a broad ecosystem promises to supercharge human productivity, for example, by giving every human on earth a digital assistant — or assistants — allowing people to live richer lives that they can interact with quickly and fluidly.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m collaborating with WhatsApp,” Huang said. “Imagine I’m sitting here typing, and it’s generating the images as I’m going. I go back and change my words, and it’s generating other images.”</p>
<p><b>Vision for the Future</b></p>
<p>Looking ahead, both CEOs shared their visions for the future.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg expressed optimism about bringing AI together with the real world through eyeglasses — noting his company’s collaboration with eyewear maker Luxottica — that can be used to help transform education, entertainment and work.</p>
<p>Huang emphasized how interacting with AIs is becoming more fluid, moving beyond just text-based interactions.</p>
<p>“Today’s AI is kind of turn-based. You say something, it says something back to you,” Huang said. In the future, AI could contemplate multiple options, or come up with a tree of options and simulate outcomes, making it much more powerful.”</p>
<p>Throughout the conversation, the two leaders playfully bantered about everything from fashion to steak sandwiches, ending the discussion by exchanging leather jackets.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg gave Huang a black leather shearling jacket with an enormous hood.</p>
<p>Huang gave Zuckerberg his own leather jacket, which he got from his wife, Lori, just for SIGGRAPH, quipping that it was just “two hours old.”</p>
<p>“Well this one’s yours,” Zuckerberg said with a smile. “This is worth more because it’s used.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>The generative AI revolution — with deep roots in visual computing — is amplifying human creativity even as accelerated computing promises significant gains in energy efficiency, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said Monday.</p>
<p>That makes this week&#8217;s SIGGRAPH professional graphics conference, in Denver, the logical venue to discuss what’s next.</p>
<p>“Everybody will have an AI assistant,” Huang said. “Every single company, every single job within the company, will have AI assistance.”</p>
<p>But even as generative AI promises to amplify human productivity, Huang said the accelerated computing technology that underpins it promises to make computing more energy efficient.</p>
<p>“Accelerated computing helps you save so much energy, 20 times, 50 times, and doing the same processing,” Huang said. “The first thing we have to do, as a society, is accelerate every application we can: this reduces the amount of energy being used all over the world.”</p>

<p>The conversation follows a spate of announcements from NVIDIA today.</p>
<p><a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-generative-ai-models-and-nim-microservices-for-openusd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA introduced a new suite of NIM microservices</a> tailored for diverse workflows, including OpenUSD, 3D modeling, physics, materials, robotics, industrial digital twins and physical AI.<br />
These advancements aim to enhance developer capabilities, particularly with the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/hugging-face-inference-nim-microservices-dgx-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integration of Hugging Face Inference-as-a-Service on DGX Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/edify-shutterstock-getty-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock has launched a Generative 3D Service</a>, while <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/edify-shutterstock-getty-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getty Images has upgraded its offerings using NVIDIA Edify technology</a>.</p>
<p>In the realm of AI and graphics, NVIDIA has revealed new <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-physical-ai-nim-microservices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenUSD NIM microservices and reference workflows</a> designed for generative physical AI applications.</p>
<p>This includes a <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-accelerates-worldwide-humanoid-robotics-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">program for accelerating humanoid robotics development</a> through new NIM microservices for robotics simulation and more.</p>
<p>Finally, WPP, the world&#8217;s largest advertising agency, is using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/coca-cola-wpp-omniverse-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omniverse-driven generative AI for The Coca-Cola Company</a>, helping drive brand authenticity, and showcasing the practical applications of NVIDIA’s advancements in AI technology across various industries.</p>
<p>Huang and Goode started their conversation by exploring how visual computing gave rise to everything from computer games to digital animation to GPU-accelerated computing and, most recently, generative AI powered by industrial-scale AI factories.</p>
<p>All these advancements build on one another. Robotics, for example, requires advanced AI and photorealistic virtual worlds where AI can be trained before being deployed into next-generation humanoid robots.</p>
<p>Huang explained that robotics requires three computers: one to train the AI, one to test the AI in a physically accurate simulation, and one within the robot itself.</p>
<p>“Just about every industry is going to be affected by this, whether it’s scientific computing trying to do a better job predicting the weather with a lot less energy, to augmenting and collaborating with creators to generate images, or generating virtual scenes for industrial visualization,” Huang said. “Robotic self-driving cars are all going to be transformed by generative AI.”</p>
<p>Likewise, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Omniverse systems</a> — built around the OpenUSD standard — will also be key to harnessing generative AI to create assets that the world’s largest brands can use.</p>
<p>By pulling from brand assets that live in Omniverse, which can capture brand assets, these systems can capture and replicate carefully curated brand magic.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-73392" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1-672x357.png" alt="" width="672" height="357" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1-672x357.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1-400x213.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1-768x408.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1-842x447.png 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1-406x215.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1-188x100.png 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, all these systems — visual computing, simulation and large-language models — will come together to create digital humans who can help people interact with digital systems of all kinds.</p>
<p>“One of the things that we’re announcing here this week is the concept of digital agents, digital AIs that will augment every single job in the company,” Huang said.</p>
<p>“And so one of the most important use cases that people are discovering is customer service,” Huang said. “In the future, my guess is that it’s going to be human still, but AI in the loop.”</p>
<p>All of this, like any new tool, promises to amplify human productivity and creativity. “Imagine the stories that you’re going to be able to tell with these tools,” Huang said.</p>

<p>Coca-Cola has been working with WPP to develop <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/">digital twin</a> tools and roll out Prod X — a custom production studio experience created specifically for the beverage maker to use globally.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wpp.com/news/2024/07/wpp-to-create-generative-3d-worlds-in-collaboration-with-nvidia">WPP announced</a> today at SIGGRAPH that The Coca-Cola Company will be an early adopter for integrating the <a target="_blank" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-generative-ai-models-and-nim-microservices-for-openusd">new NVIDIA NIM microservices</a> for Universal Scene Description (aka OpenUSD) into its Prod X roadmap. <a target="_blank" href="https://aousd.org/blog/explainer-series-what-is-openusd/">OpenUSD</a> is a 3D framework that enables interoperability between software tools and data types for building virtual worlds. NIM inference microservices provide models as optimized containers.</p>
<p>The USD Search NIM allows WPP to tap into a large archive of models to create on-brand assets, and the USD Code NIM can be used to assemble them into scenes.</p>
<p>These NIM microservices will enable Prod X users to create 3D advertising assets that contain culturally relevant elements on a global scale, using prompt engineering to quickly make adjustments to AI-generated images so that brands can better target their products at local markets.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="BTS: how WPP is creating generative 3D worlds using NVIDIA NIM microservices" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-vsX-NzHzw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Tapping Into NVIDIA NIM Microservices to Deploy Generative AI </b></h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/media-and-entertainment/wpp/">WPP</a> said that the NVIDIA NIM microservices will have a lasting impact on the 3D engineering and art world.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/usdsearch">USD Search NIM</a> can make WPP’s massive visual asset libraries quickly available via written prompts. The <a target="_blank" href="https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/usdcode-llama3-70b-instruct">USD Code NIM</a> allows developers to enter prompts and get Python code to create novel 3D worlds.</p>
<p>“The beauty of the solution is that it compresses multiple phases of the production process into a single interface and process,” said Perry Nightingale, senior vice president of creative AI at WPP, of the new NIM microservices. “It empowers artists to get more out of the technology and create better work.”</p>
<h2><b>Redefining Content Production With Production Studio</b></h2>
<p>WPP recently announced the release of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wpp.com/news/2024/06/wpp-unveils-ai-powered-production-studio">Production Studio</a> on WPP Open, the company’s intelligent marketing operating system powered by AI. Co-developed with its production company, Hogarth, Production Studio taps into the Omniverse development platform and OpenUSD for its generative AI-enabled <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/use-cases/3d-product-configurator/">product configurator</a> workflows.</p>
<p>Production Studio can streamline and automate multilingual text, image and video creation, simplifying content creation for advertisers and marketers, and directly addresses the challenges advertisers continue to face in producing brand-compliant and product-accurate content at scale.</p>
<p>“Our groundbreaking research with NVIDIA Omniverse for the past few years, and the research and development associated with having built our own core USD pipeline and decades of experience in 3D workflows, is what made it possible for us to stand up a tailored experience like this for The Coca-Cola Company,” said Priti Mhatre, managing director for strategic consulting and AI at Hogarth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>NVIDIA announced at SIGGRAPH <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/fvdb">fVDB</a>, a new deep-learning framework for generating AI-ready virtual representations of the real world.</p>
<p>fVDB is built on top of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openvdb.org/">OpenVDB</a>, the industry-standard library for simulating and rendering sparse volumetric data such as water, fire, smoke and clouds.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-physical-ai/">Generative physical AI</a>, such as autonomous vehicles and robots that inhabit the real world, need to have “spatial intelligence” — the ability to understand and operate in 3D space.</p>
<p>Capturing the large scale and super-fine details of the world around us is essential. But converting reality into a virtual representation to train AI is hard.</p>
<p>Raw data for real-world environments can be collected through many different techniques, like neural radiance fields (<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/neural-radiance-fields-3d-models/">NeRFs</a>) and lidar. fVDB translates this data into massive, AI-ready environments rendered in real time.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Train Physical AI With Real-World Simulations Using fVDB." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rx55wDWqSrw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Building on a decade of innovation in the OpenVDB standard, the introduction of<a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01781"> fVDB</a> at SIGGRAPH represents a significant leap forward in how industries can benefit from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/">digital twins</a> of the real world.</p>
<p>Reality-scale virtual environments are used for training autonomous agents. City-scale 3D models are captured by drones for climate science and disaster planning. Today, 3D generative AI is even used to plan urban spaces and smart cities.</p>
<p>fVDB enables industries to tap into spatial intelligence on a larger scale and with higher resolution than ever before, making physical AI even smarter.</p>
<p>The framework builds NVIDIA-accelerated AI operators on top of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nanovdb">NanoVDB</a>, a GPU-accelerated data structure for efficient 3D simulations. These operators include convolution, pooling, attention and meshing, all of which are designed for high-performance 3D deep learning applications.</p>
<p>AI operators allow businesses to build complex neural networks for spatial intelligence, like large-scale point cloud reconstruction and 3D generative modeling.</p>
<p>fVDB is the result of a long-running effort by NVIDIA’s research team and is already used to support <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/">NVIDIA Research</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/drive">NVIDIA DRIVE</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> projects that require high-fidelity models of large, complex real-world spaces.</p>
<h2><b>Key Advantages of fVDB</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">Larger: 4x larger spatial scale than prior frameworks</li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">Faster: 3.5x faster than prior frameworks</li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">Interoperable: Businesses can fully tap into massive real-world datasets. fVDB reads VDB datasets into full-sized 3D environments. AI-ready and real-time rendered for building physical AI with spatial intelligence.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">More powerful: 10x more operators than prior frameworks. fVDB simplifies processes by combining functionalities that previously required multiple deep-learning libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>fVDB will soon be available as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> inference microservices. A trio of the microservices will enable businesses to incorporate fVDB into <a target="_blank" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-expands-openusd-to-generative-ai-for-robotics-industrial-digitalization-markets">OpenUSD workflows</a>, generating AI-ready OpenUSD geometry in NVIDIA Omniverse, a development platform for industrial digitalization and generative physical AI applications. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">fVDB Mesh Generation NIM — Generates digital 3D environments of the real world</li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">fVDB NeRF-XL NIM — Generates large-scale NeRFs in OpenUSD using Omniverse Cloud APIs</li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">fVDB Physics Super-Res NIM — Performs super-resolution to generate an OpenUSD-based, high-resolution physics simulation</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past decade, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openvdb.org/about/">OpenVDB</a>, housed at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aswf.io/blog/fvdb/">Academy Software Foundation</a>, has earned multiple <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/academy-awards-vfx-openusd/">Academy Awards</a> as a core technology used throughout the visual-effects industry. It has since grown beyond entertainment to industrial and scientific uses, like industrial design and robotics.</p>
<p>NVIDIA continues to enhance the open-source OpenVDB library. Four years ago, the company introduced <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nanovdb">NanoVDB</a>, which added GPU support to OpenVDB. This delivered an order-of-magnitude speed-up, enabling faster performance and easier development, and opening the door to real-time simulation and rendering.</p>
<p>Two years ago, NVIDIA introduced <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rendering-technologies/neuralvdb">NeuralVDB</a>, which builds machine learning on top of NanoVDB to compress the memory footprint of VDB volumes up to 100x, allowing creators, developers and researchers to interact with extremely large and complex datasets.</p>
<p>fVDB builds AI operators on top of NanoVDB to unlock spatial intelligence at the scale of reality. Apply to the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/fvdb/early-access-form">early-access program</a> for the fVDB PyTorch extension. fVDB will also be available as part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb">OpenVDB GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dive deeper into <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/building-spatial-intelligence-from-real-world-3d-data-using-deep-learning-framework-fvdb/">fVDB in this technical blog</a> and watch how accelerated computing and generative AI are transforming industries and creating new opportunities for innovation and growth in NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s two <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/siggraph/">fireside chats</a> at SIGGRAPH.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>One of the world’s largest AI communities — comprising 4 million developers on the Hugging Face platform — is gaining easy access to NVIDIA-accelerated inference on some of the most popular AI models.</p>
<p>New inference-as-a-service capabilities will enable developers to rapidly deploy leading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language models</a> such as the Llama 3 family and Mistral AI models with optimization from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> microservices running on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Announced today at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/siggraph/">SIGGRAPH</a> conference, the service will help developers quickly prototype with open-source AI models hosted on the Hugging Face Hub and deploy them in production. Enterprise Hub users can tap serverless inference for increased flexibility, minimal infrastructure overhead and optimized performance with NVIDIA NIM.</p>
<p>The inference service complements <a target="_blank" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-hugging-face-to-connect-millions-of-developers-to-generative-ai-supercomputing">Train on DGX Cloud</a>, an AI training service already available on Hugging Face.</p>
<p>Developers facing a growing number of open-source models can benefit from a hub where they can easily compare options. These training and inference tools give Hugging Face developers new ways to experiment with, test and deploy cutting-edge models on NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure. They’re made easily accessible using the “Train” and “Deploy” drop-down menus on Hugging Face model cards, letting users get started with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>Get started with <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/inference-dgx-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inference-as-a-service powered by NVIDIA NIM</a>.</p>
<p><b>Beyond a Token Gesture — NVIDIA NIM Brings Big Benefits</b></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> is a collection of AI microservices — including NVIDIA AI foundation models and open-source community models — optimized for inference using industry-standard application programming interfaces, or APIs.</p>
<p>NIM offers users higher efficiency in processing tokens — the units of data used and generated by a language model. The optimized microservices also improve the efficiency of the underlying NVIDIA DGX Cloud infrastructure, which can increase the speed of critical AI applications.</p>
<p>This means developers see faster, more robust results from an AI model accessed as a NIM compared with other versions of the model. The 70-billion-parameter version of Llama 3, for example, delivers up to 5x higher throughput when accessed as a NIM compared with off-the-shelf deployment on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU-powered systems</a>.</p>
<p><b>Near-Instant Access to DGX Cloud Provides Accessible AI Acceleration</b></p>
<p>The NVIDIA DGX Cloud platform is purpose-built for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>, offering developers easy access to reliable accelerated computing infrastructure that can help them bring production-ready applications to market faster.</p>
<p>The platform provides scalable GPU resources that support every step of AI development, from prototype to production, without requiring developers to make long-term AI infrastructure commitments.</p>
<p>Hugging Face inference-as-a-service on NVIDIA DGX Cloud powered by NIM microservices offers easy access to compute resources that are optimized for AI deployment, enabling users to experiment with the latest AI models in an enterprise-grade environment.</p>
<p><b>More on NVIDIA NIM at SIGGRAPH </b></p>
<p>At SIGGRAPH, NVIDIA also introduced <a target="_blank" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-generative-ai-models-and-nim-microservices-for-openusd">generative AI models and NIM microservices for the OpenUSD framework</a> to accelerate developers’ abilities to build highly accurate virtual worlds for the next evolution of AI.</p>
