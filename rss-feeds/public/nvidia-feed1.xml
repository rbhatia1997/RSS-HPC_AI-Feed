										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>In a major stride toward building a shared national research infrastructure, the U.S. National Science Foundation has launched the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource pilot program with significant support from NVIDIA.</p>
<p>The initiative aims to broaden access to the tools needed to power responsible AI discovery and innovation. It was announced Wednesday in partnership with 10 other federal agencies as well as private-sector, nonprofit and philanthropic organizations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe breadth of partners that have come together for this pilot underscores the urgency of developing a National AI Research Resource for the future of AI in America,‚Äù said NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. ‚ÄúBy investing in AI research through the NAIRR pilot, the United States unleashes discovery and impact and bolsters its global competitiveness.‚Äù</p>
<p>NVIDIA‚Äôs commitment of $30 million in technology contributions over two years is a key factor in enlarging the scale of the pilot, fueling the potential for broader achievements and accelerating the momentum toward full-scale implementation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe NAIRR is a vision of a national research infrastructure that will provide access to computing, data, models and software to empower researchers and communities,‚Äù said Katie Antypas, director of the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure at the NSF.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur primary goals for the NAIRR pilot are to support fundamental AI research and domain-specific research applying AI, reach broader communities, particularly those currently unable to participate in the AI innovation ecosystem, and refine the design for the future full NAIRR,‚Äù Antypas added.</p>
<h2>Accelerating Access to AI</h2>
<p>‚ÄúAI is increasingly defining our era, and its potential can best be fulfilled with broad access to its transformative capabilities,‚Äù said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPartnerships are really at the core of the NAIRR pilot,‚Äù said Tess DeBlanc-Knowles, NSF‚Äôs special assistant to the director for artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been incredibly impressive to see this breadth of partners come together in these 90 days, bringing together government, industry, nonprofits and philanthropies,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúOur industry and nonprofit partners are bringing critical expertise and resources, which are essential to advance AI and move forward with trustworthy AI initiatives.‚Äù</p>
<p>NVIDIA‚Äôs collaboration with scientific centers aims to significantly scale up educational and workforce training programs, enhancing AI literacy and skill development across the scientific community.</p>
<p>NVIDIA will harness insights from researchers using its platform, offering an opportunity to refine and enhance the effectiveness of its technology for science, and supporting continuous advancement in AI applications.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith NVIDIA AI software and supercomputing, the scientists, researchers and engineers of the extended NSF community will be able to utilize the world‚Äôs leading infrastructure to fuel a new generation of innovation,‚Äù Huang said.</p>
<h2>The Foundation for Modern AI</h2>
<p>Accelerating both AI research and research done with AI, NVIDIA‚Äôs contributions include <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a> AI supercomputing resources and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software.</p>
<p>Offering full-stack accelerated computing from systems to software, NVIDIA AI provides the foundation for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>, with significant adoption across research and industries.</p>
<h2>Broad Support Across the US Government</h2>
<p>As part of this national endeavor, the NAIRR pilot brings together a coalition of government partners, showcasing a unified approach to advancing AI research.</p>
<p>Its partners include the U.S. National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Standards and Technology,‚ÄØNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, U.S. Patent and Trade Office and the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
<p>The NAIRR pilot builds on the United States‚Äô rich history of leading large-scale scientific endeavors, such as the creation of the internet, which, in turn, led to the advancement of AI.</p>
<h2>Leading in Advanced AI</h2>
<p>NAIRR promises to drive innovations across various sectors, from healthcare to environmental science, positioning the U.S. at the forefront of global AI advancements.</p>
<p>The launch meets a goal outlined in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Executive Order 14110</a>, signed by President Biden in October 2023, directing NSF to launch a pilot for the NAIRR within 90 days.</p>
<p>The NAIRR pilot will provide access to advanced computing, datasets, models, software, training and user support to U.S.-based researchers and educators.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSmaller institutions, rural institutions, institutions serving underrepresented populations are key communities we‚Äôre trying to reach with the NAIRR,‚Äù said Antypas. ‚ÄúThese communities are less likely to have resources to build their own computing or data resources.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Paving the Way for Future Investments</h2>
<p>As the pilot expedites the proof of concept, future investments in the NAIRR will democratize access to AI innovation and support critical work advancing the development of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/trustworthy-ai/">trustworthy AI</a>.</p>
<p>The pilot will initially support AI research to advance safe, secure and trustworthy AI as well as the application of AI to challenges in healthcare and environmental and infrastructure sustainability.</p>
<p>Researchers can apply for initial access to NAIRR pilot resources <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/news/democratizing-future-ai-rd-nsf-launch-national-ai">through the NSF</a>. The NAIRR pilot welcomes additional private-sector and nonprofit partners.</p>
<p>Those interested are encouraged to reach out to NSF at <a href="mailto:nairr_pilot@nsf.gov">nairr_pilot@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<h2><b>Leveling Up With RTX</b></h2>
<p>Vishal Ranga has a decade‚Äôs worth of experience in the gaming industry, where he pursues level design.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI&#8217;ve loved playing video games since forever, and that curiosity led me to game design,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA few years later, I found my sweet spot in technical art.‚Äù</p>
<figure id="attachment_69434" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69434" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69434" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69434" class="wp-caption-text">Ranga specializes in level design.</figcaption></figure>
<p>His stunning scene <i>Disowned </i>was born out of experimentation with Unreal Engine‚Äôs new ray-traced global illumination lighting capabilities.</p>
<p>Remarkably, he skipped the concepting process ‚Äî the entire project was conceived solely from Ranga‚Äôs imagination.</p>
<p>Applying the water shader and mocking up the lighting early helped Ranga set up the mood of the scene. He then updated old assets and searched the Unreal Engine store for new ones ‚Äî what he couldn‚Äôt find, like fishing nets and custom flags, he created from scratch.</p>

<p>Ranga‚Äôs GeForce RTX graphics card unlocked RTX-accelerated rendering for high-fidelity, interactive visualization of 3D designs during virtual production.</p>
<p>Next, he tackled shader work, blending in moss and muck into models of wood, nets and flags. He also created a volumetric local fog shader to complement the assets as they pass through the fog, adding greater depth to the scene.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69428" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69428" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69428" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69428" class="wp-caption-text">Shaders add extraordinary depth and visual detail.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ranga then polished everything up. He first used a water shader to add realism to reflections, surface moss and subtle waves, then tinkered with global illumination and reflection effects, along with other post-process settings.</p>

<p>Ranga used Unreal Engine‚Äôs internal high-resolution screenshot feature and sequencer to capture renders. This was achieved by cranking up screen resolution to 200%, resulting in crisper details.</p>
<p>Throughout, DLSS enhanced Ranga‚Äôs creative workflow, allowing for smooth scene movement while maintaining immaculate visual quality.</p>
<p>When finished with adjustments, Ranga exported the final scene in no time thanks to his RTX GPU.</p>

<p>Ranga encourages budding artists who are excited by the latest creative advances but wondering where to begin to ‚Äúpractice your skills, prioritize the basics.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúTake the time to practice and really experience the highs and lows of the creation process,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget to maintain good well-being to maximize your potential.‚Äù</p>

<p>At CES, NVIDIA invited industry leaders to share their perspectives on how technology, especially AI and computing power, is shaping the future of transportation.</p>
<p>Watch the video to learn more from NVIDIA‚Äôs auto partners.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA DRIVE Partners Showcase Cutting-Edge Innovations in Automated and Autonomous Driving" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBjcI-OrI2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Redefining Possibilities Through Partnership</strong></h2>
<p>Magnus Ostberg, chief software officer at Mercedes-Benz, underscores how the company‚Äôs partnership with NVIDIA helps push technological boundaries. ‚Äú[NVIDIA] enables us to go further to bring automated driving to the next level and into areas that we couldn‚Äôt go before,‚Äù he says.</p>
<h2><strong>Computing Power: The Driving Force Behind Autonomy</strong></h2>
<p>Shawn Kerrigan, chief operating officer and cofounder at Plus, emphasizes the role of computing power, saying, ‚ÄúAutonomous technology requires immense computing power in order to really understand the world around it and make safe driving decisions.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat was impossible to do previously because computing wasn‚Äôt strong enough is now doable,‚Äù says Eran Ofir, CEO of Imagry. ‚ÄúThis is an enabler for the progress of the autonomous driving industry.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe wanted a platform that has a track record of being deployed in the automotive industry,‚Äù adds Stefan Solyom, chief technology officer at Pebble. ‚ÄúThis is what NVIDIA can give us.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Martin Kristensson, head of product strategy at Volvo Cars, says, ‚ÄúWe partner with NVIDIA to get the best compute that we can. More compute in the car means that we can be more aware of the environment around us and reacting earlier and being even safer.‚Äù</p>
<h2><strong>The Critical Role of AI</strong></h2>
<p>Don Burnette, CEO and founder of Kodiak Robotics, states, ‚ÄúNVIDIA makes best-in-class hardware accelerators, and I think it‚Äôs going to play a large role in the AI developments for self-driving going forward.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúDriving as a routine task is tedious,‚Äù adds Tony Han, CEO and cofounder of WeRide. ‚ÄúWe want to alleviate people from the burden of driving to give back the time. NVIDIA is the backbone of our AI engine.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>It‚Äôs hard to imagine an industry more competitive ‚Äî or fast-paced ‚Äî than online retail.</p>
<p>Sellers need to create attractive and informative product listings that must be engaging, capture attention and generate trust.</p>
<p>Amazon uses optimized containers on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs</a> to power a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> tool that finds this balance at the speed of modern retail.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/small-business/amazon-sellers-generative-ai-tool">Amazon‚Äôs new generative AI capabilities help sellers seamlessly create compelling </a>titles, bullet points, descriptions, and product attributes.</p>
<p>To get started, Amazon identifies listings where content could be improved and leverages generative AI to generate high-quality content automatically. Sellers review the generated content and can provide feedback if they want to or accept the content changes to the Amazon catalog.</p>
<p>Previously, creating detailed product listings required significant time and effort for sellers, but this simplified process gives them more time to focus on other tasks.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-inference-on-llms-with-tensorrt-llm-now-publicly-available/">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a> software is available today on <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM">GitHub</a> and can be accessed through <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a>, which offers enterprise-grade security, support, and reliability for production AI.</p>
<p>TensorRT-LLM open-source software makes AI inference faster and smarter. It works with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/">large language models</a>, such as Amazon‚Äôs models for the above capabilities, which are trained on vast amounts of text.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, TensorRT-LLM enables up to an <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-supercharges-large-language-model-inference-on-nvidia-h100-gpus/">8x speedup on foundation</a> LLMs such as Llama 1 and 2, Falcon, Mistral, MPT, ChatGLM, Starcoder and more.</p>
<p>It also supports multi-GPU and multi-node inference, in-flight batching, paged attention, and Hopper <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/h100-transformer-engine/">Transformer Engine</a> with FP8 precision; all of which improves latencies and efficiency for the seller experience.</p>
<p>By using TensorRT-LLM and NVIDIA GPUs, Amazon improved its generative AI tool‚Äôs inference efficiency in terms of cost or GPUs needed by 2x, and reduced inference latency by 3x compared with an earlier implementation without TensorRT-LLM.</p>
<p>The efficiency gains make it more environmentally friendly, and the 3x latency improvement makes Amazon Catalog‚Äôs generative capabilities more responsive.</p>
<p>The generative AI capabilities can save sellers time and provide richer information with less effort. For example, it can enrich a listing for a wireless mouse with an ergonomic design, long battery life, adjustable cursor settings, and compatibility with various devices. It can also generate product attributes such as color, size, weight, and material. These details can help customers make informed decisions and reduce returns.</p>
<p>With generative AI, Amazon‚Äôs sellers can quickly and easily create more engaging listings, while being more energy efficient, making it possible to reach more customers and grow their business faster.</p>
<p><i>Developers can start with </i><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-inference-on-llms-with-tensorrt-llm-now-publicly-available/"><i>TensorRT-LLM</i></a><i> today, with enterprise support available through NVIDIA AI Enterprise.</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Mark Swinnerton aims to fight climate change by transforming abandoned mines into storage tanks of renewable energy.</p>
<p>The CEO of startup Green Gravity is prototyping his ambitious vision in a warehouse 60 miles south of Sydney, Australia, and simulating it in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform for building 3D workflows and applications.</p>
<p>The concept requires some heavy lifting. Solar and wind energy will pull steel blocks weighing as much as 30 cars each up shafts taller than a New York skyscraper, storing potential energy that can turn turbines whenever needed.</p>
<h2><b>A Distributed Energy Network</b></h2>
<p>Swinnerton believes it‚Äôs the optimal way to save renewable energy because nearly a million abandoned mine shafts are scattered around the globe, many of them already connected to the grid. And his mechanical system is cheaper and greener than alternatives like massive lithium batteries better suited for electric vehicles.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69364" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69364" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mark-Swinnerton-Green-Gravity-CEO.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-69364 size-thumbnail" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mark-Swinnerton-Green-Gravity-CEO-150x150.jpg" alt="Mark Swinnerton, CEO Green Gravity" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mark-Swinnerton-Green-Gravity-CEO-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mark-Swinnerton-Green-Gravity-CEO-400x400.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mark-Swinnerton-Green-Gravity-CEO-502x500.jpg 502w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mark-Swinnerton-Green-Gravity-CEO-768x765.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mark-Swinnerton-Green-Gravity-CEO-452x450.jpg 452w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mark-Swinnerton-Green-Gravity-CEO-216x215.jpg 216w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mark-Swinnerton-Green-Gravity-CEO-100x100.jpg 100w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mark-Swinnerton-Green-Gravity-CEO-1280x1276.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mark-Swinnerton-Green-Gravity-CEO.jpg 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69364" class="wp-caption-text">Mark Swinnerton</figcaption></figure>
<p>Officials in Australia, India and the U.S. are interested in the concept, and a state-owned mine operator in Romania is conducting a joint study with Green Gravity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have a tremendous opportunity for repurposing a million mines,‚Äù said Swinnerton, who switched gears after a 20-year career at BHP Group, one of the world‚Äôs largest mining companies, determined to combat climate change.</p>
<h2><b>A Digital-First Design</b></h2>
<p>A longtime acquaintance saw an opportunity to accelerate Swinnerton‚Äôs efforts with a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/">digital twin</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was fascinated by the Green Gravity idea and suggested taking a digital-first approach, using data as a differentiator,‚Äù said Daniel Keys, an IT expert and executive at <a href="https://xamplify.com.au/">xAmplify</a>, a provider of accelerated computing services.</p>
<p>AI-powered simulations could speed the design and deployment of the novel concept, said Keys, who met Swinnerton 25 years earlier at one of their first jobs, flipping burgers at a fast-food stand.</p>
<p>Today, they‚Äôve got a digital prototype cooking on xAmplify‚Äôs Scaile computer, based on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-platform/">NVIDIA DGX systems</a>. It‚Äôs already accelerating Green Gravity‚Äôs proof of concept.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThanks to what we inferred with a digital twin, we‚Äôve been able to save 40% of the costs of our physical prototype by shifting from three weights to two and moving them 10 instead of 15 meters vertically,‚Äù said Swinnerton.</p>
<h2><b>Use Cases Enabled by Omniverse</b></h2>
<p>It‚Äôs the first of many use cases Green Gravity is developing in Omniverse.</p>
<p>Once the prototype is done, the simulation will help scale the design to mines as deep as 7,000 feet, or about six Empire State Buildings stacked on top of each other. Ultimately, the team will build in Omniverse a dashboard to control and monitor sensor-studded facilities without the safety hazards of sending a person into the mine.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69367" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69367" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-672x367.jpg" alt="Green Gravity‚Äôs physical prototype and test lab." width="672" height="367" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-672x367.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-400x218.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-768x419.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-1536x838.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-825x450.jpg 825w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-394x215.jpg 394w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-183x100.jpg 183w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-1280x698.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab.jpg 1833w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69367" class="wp-caption-text">Green Gravity‚Äôs physical prototype and test lab.</figcaption></figure>
<p>‚ÄúWe expect to cut tens of millions of dollars off the estimated $100 million for the first site because we can use simulations to lower our risks with banks and insurers,‚Äù said Swinnerton. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a real tantalizing opportunity.‚Äù</p>
<h2><b>Virtual Visualization Tools</b></h2>
<p>Operators will track facilities remotely using visualization systems equipped with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a40/">NVIDIA A40 GPUs</a> and can stream their visuals to tablets thanks to the TabletAR extension in the Omniverse Spatial Framework.</p>
<p>xAmplify‚Äôs workflow uses a number of software components such as <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus">NVIDIA Modulus</a>, a framework for physics-informed machine learning models.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe also use Omniverse as a core integration fabric that lets us connect a half-dozen third-party tools operators and developers need, like Siemens PLM for sensor management and Autodesk for design,‚Äù Keys said.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Green Gravity at Nvidia Day 2023 SIGGRAPH" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/902088869?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p>
<p>Omniverse eases the job of integrating third-party applications into one 3D workflow because it‚Äôs based on the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/openusd-alliance-3d-standard/">OpenUSD standard</a>.</p>
<p>Along the way, AI sifts reams of data about the thousands of available mines to select optimal sites, predicting their potential for energy storage. Machine learning will also help optimize designs for each site.</p>
<p>Taken together, it‚Äôs a digital pathway Swinnerton believes will lead to commercial operations for Green Gravity within the next couple years.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the latest customer for xAmplify‚Äôs Canberra data center serving Australian government agencies, national defense contractors and an expanding set of enterprise users with a full stack of NVIDIA accelerated software.</p>

<p>DigitalPath is igniting change in the Golden State ‚Äî using computer vision, generative adversarial networks and a network of thousands of cameras to detect signs of fire in real time.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/ai-podcast/">NVIDIA‚Äôs AI Podcast</a>, host Noah Kravtiz spoke with DigitalPath System Architect Ethan Higgins about the company‚Äôs role in the ALERTCalifornia initiative, a collaboration between California‚Äôs wildfire fighting agency <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/">CAL FIRE</a> and the University of California, San Diego.</p>
<p>DigitalPath built computer vision models to process images collected from network cameras ‚Äî anywhere from 8 million to 16 million a day ‚Äî intelligently identifying signs of fire like smoke.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne of the things we realized early on, though, is that it‚Äôs not necessarily a problem about just detecting a fire in a picture,‚Äù Higgins said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a process of making a manageable amount of data to handle.‚Äù</p>
<p>That‚Äôs because, he explained, it‚Äôs unlikely that humans will be entirely out of the loop in the detection process for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The company uses various AI algorithms to classify images based on whether they should be reviewed or acted upon ‚Äî if so, an alert is sent out to a CAL FIRE command center.</p>
<p>One of the downsides to using computer vision to detect wildfires is that extinguishing more fires means a greater buildup of natural fuel and the potential for larger wildfires in the long term. DigitalPath and UCSD are exploring the use of high-resolution lidar data to identify where those fuels can be released in the form of prescribed burns.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Higgins foresees the field tapping generative AI to accelerate new simulation tools and using AI models to analyze the output of other models to doubly improve wildfire prediction and detection.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAI is not perfect, but when you couple multiple models together, it can get really close,‚Äù he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Indigenous languages are under threat. Some 3,000 ‚Äî three-quarters of the total ‚Äî could disappear before the end of the century, or one every two weeks, according to <a href="https://www.iesalc.unesco.org/en/2022/02/21/a-decade-to-prevent-the-disappearance-of-3000-languages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO</a>.</p>
<p>As part of a movement to protect such languages, New Zealand‚Äôs Te Hiku Media, a broadcaster focused on the MƒÅori people‚Äôs indigenous language known as te reo, is using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/trustworthy-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trustworthy AI</a> to help preserve and revitalize the tongue.</p>
<p>Using ethical, transparent methods of speech data collection and analysis to maintain data sovereignty for the MƒÅori people, Te Hiku Media is developing <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/essential-guide-to-automatic-speech-recognition-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automatic speech recognition</a> (ASR) models for te reo, which is a Polynesian language.</p>
<p>Built using the open-source <a href="https://nvidia.github.io/NeMo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA NeMo toolkit</a> for ASR and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, the speech-to-text models transcribe te reo with 92% accuracy. It can also transcribe bilingual speech using English and te reo with 82% accuracy. They‚Äôre pivotal tools, made by and for the MƒÅori people, that are helping preserve and amplify their stories.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs immense value in using NVIDIA‚Äôs open-source technologies to build the tools we need to ultimately achieve our mission, which is the preservation, promotion and revitalization of te reo MƒÅori,‚Äù said Keoni Mahelona, chief technology officer at Te Hiku Media, who leads a team of data scientists and developers, as well as MƒÅori language experts and data curators, working on the project.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre also helping guide the industry on ethical ways of using data and technologies to ensure they‚Äôre used for the empowerment of marginalized communities,‚Äù added Mahelona, a Native Hawaiian now living in New Zealand.</p>
<h2><b>Building a ‚ÄòHouse of Speech‚Äô</b></h2>
<p>Te Hiku Media began more than three decades ago as a radio station aiming to ensure te reo had space on the airwaves. Over the years, the organization incorporated television broadcasting and, with the rise of the internet, it convened a meeting in 2013 with the community‚Äôs elders to form a strategy for sharing content in the digital era.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe elders agreed that we should make the stories accessible online for our community members ‚Äî rather than just keeping our archives on cassettes in boxes ‚Äî but once we had that objective, the challenge was how to do this correctly, in alignment with our strong roots in valuing sovereignty,‚Äù Mahelona said.</p>
<p>Instead of uploading its video and audio sources to popular, global platforms ‚Äî which, in their terms and conditions of use, require signing over certain rights related to the content ‚Äî Te Hiku Media decided to build its own content distribution platform.</p>
<p>Called Whare K≈çrero ‚Äî meaning ‚Äúhouse of speech‚Äù ‚Äî the platform now holds more than 30 years‚Äô worth of digitized, archival material featuring about 1,000 hours of te reo native speakers, some of whom were born in the late 19th century, as well as more recent content from second-language learners and bilingual MƒÅori people.</p>
<p>Now, around 20 MƒÅori radio stations use and upload their content to Whare K≈çrero. Community members can access the content through an app.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an invaluable resource of acoustic data,‚Äù Mahelona said.</p>
<h2><b>Turning to Trustworthy AI</b></h2>
<p>Such a trove held incredible value for those working to revitalize the language, the Te Hiku Media team quickly realized, but manual transcription required pulling lots of time and effort from limited resources. So began the organization‚Äôs trustworthy AI efforts, in 2016, to accelerate its work using ASR.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo one would have a clue that there are eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs in our derelict, rundown, musky-smelling building in the far north of New Zealand ‚Äî training and building MƒÅori language models,‚Äù Mahelona said. ‚ÄúBut the work has been game-changing for us.‚Äù</p>
<p>To collect speech data in a transparent, ethically compliant, community-oriented way, Te Hiku Media began by explaining its cause to elders, garnering their support and asking them to come to the station to read phrases aloud.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was really important that we had the support of the elders and that we recorded their voices, because that‚Äôs the sort of content we want to transcribe,‚Äù Mahelona said. ‚ÄúBut eventually these efforts didn‚Äôt scale ‚Äî we needed second-language learners, kids, middle-aged people and a lot more speech data in general.‚Äù</p>
<p>So, the organization ran a crowdsourcing campaign, <a href="https://koreromaori.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K≈çrero MƒÅori</a>, to collect highly labeled speech samples according to the Kaitiakitanga license, which ensures Te Hiku Media uses the data only for the benefit of the MƒÅori people.</p>
<p>In just 10 days, more than 2,500 signed up to read 200,000+ phrases, providing over 300 hours of labeled speech data, which was used to build and train the te reo MƒÅori ASR models.</p>
<p>In addition to other open-source trustworthy AI tools, Te Hiku Media now uses the NVIDIA NeMo toolkit‚Äôs ASR module for speech AI throughout its entire pipeline. The NeMo toolkit comprises building blocks called neural modules and includes <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-pretrained-ai-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretrained models</a> for language model development.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been absolutely amazing ‚Äî NVIDIA‚Äôs open-source NeMo enabled our ASR models to be bilingual and added automatic punctuation to our transcriptions,‚Äù Mahelona said.</p>
<p>Te Hiku Media‚Äôs ASR models are the engines running behind Kaituhi, a te reo MƒÅori transcription service now <a href="https://kaituhi.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available online</a>.</p>
<p>The efforts have spurred similar ASR projects now underway by Native Hawaiians and the Mohawk people in southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs indigenous-led work in trustworthy AI that‚Äôs inspiring other indigenous groups to think: ‚ÄòIf they can do it, we can do it, too,‚Äô‚Äù Mahelona said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Curiosity leads the way for this week‚Äôs featured In the NVIDIA Studio 3D artist, Brellias.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor‚Äôs note: This post is part of our weekly </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/in-the-nvidia-studio/"><i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/"><i>NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> technology improves creative workflows. We‚Äôre also deep diving on new </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/"><i>GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU</i></a><i> features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.</i></p>
<p>Curiosity leads the way for this week‚Äôs featured <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i> 3D artist, Brellias.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs what inspired the native Chilean‚Äôs latest artwork<i> Estrellitas</i>, which in English translates to ‚Äúlittle stars.‚Äù The scene expresses the mixture of emotions that comes with curiosity, depicting a young girl holding little stars in her hand with a conflicted expression.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe‚Äôs excited to learn about them, but she‚Äôs also a little scared,‚Äù Brellias explained.</p>
<p>The striking visual piece, rich with vibrant colors and expertly executed textures, underscores that while curiosity can invoke various emotions ‚Äî both joyful and painful ‚Äî it is always a source of change and growth.</p>
<h2><b>A Sky Full of Stars</b></h2>
<p>To start, Brellias first visualized and reworked an existing 3D scene of a woman in Blender. He used Blender‚Äôs built-in multi-resolution modifier for sculpting and added some shape keys to achieve the desired modifications.</p>
<p>He also created a custom shader for the character‚Äôs skin ‚Äî a stylistic choice to lend its appearance a galactic hue.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69293" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69293" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w-672x441.png" alt="" width="672" height="441" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w-672x441.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w-400x263.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w-768x504.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w-686x450.png 686w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w-328x215.png 328w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w-152x100.png 152w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69293" class="wp-caption-text">Brellias is an especially big fan of purple, blue and maroon hues.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, Brellias tapped Blender‚Äôs OptiX GPU-accelerated viewport denoising, powered by his GeForce RTX GPU.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe technology helps reduce noise and improve the quality of the viewport image more quickly, allowing me to make decisions and iterate on the render faster,‚Äù he said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69296" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69296" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69296" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69296" class="wp-caption-text">Out-of-this-world levels of detail.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, Brellias animated the scene using a base model from Daz Studio, a free media design software developed by Daz 3D. Daz features an AI denoiser for high-performance interactive rendering that can also be accelerated by RTX GPUs.</p>
<p>In addition, rig tools in Blender made the animation process easy, eliminating the need to modify file formats.</p>
<p>To animate the character‚Äôs face, Brellias tied drivers to shape keys using empties, enabling greater fluidity and control over facial expressions.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69302" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69302" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69302" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69302" class="wp-caption-text">Geometry nodes bring ‚ÄúEstrellitas‚Äù to life.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Brellias then used geometry nodes in Blender to animate the character‚Äôs hair, giving it a magical floating effect. To light the scene, Brellias added some ambient light behind the character‚Äôs face and between its hands. His RTX GPU accelerated OptiX ray tracing in Blender‚Äôs Cycles for the fastest final-frame renders.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-69286-2" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/breathe.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/breathe.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/breathe.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, he moved to Blackmagic Design‚Äôs DaVinci Resolve to denoise and deflicker the scene for the smoothest-looking animation.</p>
<p>Here, Brellias‚Äô RTX GPU accelerated the color grading, video editing and color scoping processes, dramatically speeding his creative workflow. Other RTX-accelerated AI features, including facial recognition for automatically tagging clips and the tracking of effects, were available for his use.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-69286-3" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/estrellitas.mp4?_=3" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/estrellitas.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/estrellitas.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Estrellitas</i> was partially inspired by Brellias‚Äô own curiosity in exploring NVIDIA and GeForce RTX GPU technologies to power content creation workflows ‚Äî a venture that provided rewarding results.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEvery step of my creative process involves GPU acceleration or AI in some way or another,‚Äù said Brellias. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine creating without a powerful GPU at my disposal.‚Äù</p>
<p>His curiosity in AI extends to productivity. He recently installed the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/">NVIDIA Broadcast</a> app, which can transform any room into a home studio.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA Broadcast 1.4 Update Featuring Eye Contact" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nR-vP_7XFHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The app has enhanced Brellias‚Äô microphone performance by canceling external noise and echo ‚Äî especially useful given his urban surroundings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>‚ÄúThis year, every industry will become a technology industry,‚Äù NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang told attendees Wednesday during the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou can now recognize and learn the language of almost anything with structure, and you can translate it to anything with structure ‚Äî so text-protein, protein-text,‚Äù Huang said in a fireside chat with Martin Chavez, partner and vice chairman of global investment firm Sixth Street Partners and board chair of Recursion, a biopharmaceutical company. ‚ÄúThis is the generative AI revolution.‚Äù</p>
<p>The conversation, which took place at the historic San Francisco Mint, followed a <a href="https://investor.nvidia.com/events-and-presentations/events-and-presentations/event-details/2024/JP-Morgan-Healthcare-Conference-2024-KwxXOv7uMk/default.aspx">presentation at the J.P. Morgan conference</a> Monday by Kimberly Powell, NVIDIA‚Äôs VP of healthcare. In her talk, Powell announced that <a href="https://www.recursion.com/news/nothing-short-of-phenomenal-new-deep-learning-model-available-on-nvidias-bionemo-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recursion is the first hosting partner</a> to offer a foundation model through the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a> cloud service, which is <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/drug-discovery-bionemo-generative-ai/">advancing into beta</a> this month.</p>
<p>She also said that Amgen, one of the first companies to employ BioNeMo, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/genomics-ai-amgen-superpod/">plans to advance drug discovery with generative AI</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD</a> ‚Äî and that BioNeMo is used by a growing number of techbio companies, pharmas, AI software vendors and systems integrators. Among them are <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deloitte-expands-quartz-ai-suite-with-atlas-ai-for-drug-discovery-302028784.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deloitte</a>, <a href="https://innophore.com/innophore-is-folding-the-human-proteome-using-nvidia-bionemo-creating-a-fused-dataset-of-structural-models-for-machine-learning-purposes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Innophore</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/insilico-medicine-ai-revolution-drug-discovery-in-silico-medicine-zlwfe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insilico Medicine</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/transforming-molecular-design-oneangstrom-integrates-nvidia-redon-eukpe%3FtrackingId=GwLwkk17I2oVvvfSB2KuPQ%253D%253D/?trackingId=GwLwkk17I2oVvvfSB2KuPQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OneAngstrom</a>, Recursion and <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-cloud/terray-therapeutics-customer-success-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terray Therapeutics</a>.</p>
<h2><b>From Computer-Aided Chip Design to Drug Design</b></h2>
<p>Healthcare customers and partners now consume well over a billion dollars in NVIDIA GPU computing each year ‚Äî directly and indirectly through cloud partners.</p>
<p>Huang traced NVIDIA‚Äôs involvement in accelerated healthcare back to two research projects that caught his attention around 15 years ago: one at Mass General tapped <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17881799/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA GPUs to reconstruct CT images</a>, another at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/es-la/data-center/gpu-accelerated-applications/namd/">applied GPU acceleration to molecular dynamics</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt opened my mind that we could apply the same methodology that we use in computer-aided chip design to help the world of drug discovery go from computer-aided drug discovery to computer-aided drug design,‚Äù he said, realizing that, ‚Äúif we scale this up by a billion times, we could simulate biology.‚Äù</p>
<p>After 40 years of advancements in computer-aided chip design, engineers can now build complex computing systems entirely in simulation, Huang explained. Over the next decade, the same could be true for AI-accelerated drug design.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlmost everything will largely start in silico, largely end in silico,‚Äù he said, using a term that refers to an experiment run on a computer.</p>
<h2><b>Collaborating on the Future of Drug Discovery and Medical Instruments</b></h2>
<p>With the progress made to date, computer-aided drug discovery is ‚Äúgenuinely miraculous,‚Äù Huang said.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is propelling the field forward by building state-of-the-art AI models and powerful computing platforms, and by collaborating with domain experts and investing in techbio companies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are determined to work with you to advance this field,‚Äù Huang said, inviting healthcare innovators to reach out to NVIDIA. ‚ÄúWe deeply believe that this is going to be the future of the way that drugs will be discovered and designed.‚Äù</p>
<p>The company‚Äôs pipelines for accelerated healthcare include algorithms for cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, gene sequencing, amino acid structure prediction and virtual drug molecule screening. And as AI advances, these computing tools are becoming much easier to access, Huang said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBecause of artificial intelligence and the groundbreaking work that our industry has done, we have closed the technology divide in a dramatic way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEverybody is a programmer, and the programming language of the future is called ‚Äòhuman.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>Beyond drug development, this transformation to a software-defined, AI-driven industry will also advance medical instruments.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA medical instrument is never going to be the same again. Ultrasound systems, CT scan systems, all kinds of instruments ‚Äî they‚Äôre always going to be a device plus a whole bunch of AIs,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúThe value that will create, the opportunities you create, are going to be incredible.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The financial services industry is undergoing a significant transformation with the adoption of AI technologies. NVIDIA‚Äôs fourth annual <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/finance/ai-financial-services-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of AI in Financial Services Report</a> provides insights into the current landscape and emerging trends for 2024.</p>
<p>The report reveals that an overwhelming 91% of financial services companies are either assessing AI or already using it in production. These firms are using AI to drive innovation, improve operational efficiency and enhance customer experiences.</p>
<p>Portfolio optimization, fraud detection and risk management remain top AI use cases, while <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> is quickly gaining popularity with organizations keen to uncover new efficiencies.</p>
<p>Below are the report‚Äôs key findings, which show how the financial services industry is evolving as advanced AI becomes more accessible.</p>
<h2><strong>Generative AI and Large Language Models Are on the Rise</strong></h2>
<p>Reflecting a macro-trend seen across industries, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language models</a> (LLMs) and generative AI have emerged as significant areas of interest for financial services companies. Fifty-five percent of survey respondents reported that they were actively seeking generative AI workflows for their companies.</p>
<p>Organizations are exploring generative AI and LLMs for an array of applications ranging from marketing and sales ‚Äî ad copy, email copy and content production ‚Äî to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">synthetic data generation</a>. Of these use cases, 37% of respondents showed interest in report generation, synthesis and investment research to cut down on repetitive manual work.</p>
<p>Customer experience and engagement was another sought-out use case, with a 34% response rate. This suggests that financial services institutions are exploring chatbots, virtual assistants and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/whats-a-recommender-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommendation systems</a> to enhance the customer experience.</p>
<h2><strong>AI Is Having an Impact Across Departments and Disciplines</strong></h2>
<p>With 75% of survey respondents considering their organization‚Äôs AI capabilities to be industry leading or middle of the pack, financial services organizations are becoming more confident in their ability to build, deploy and extract value from AI implementations.</p>
<p>The most popular uses for AI were in operations, risk and compliance, and marketing. To improve operational efficiency, financial organizations are using AI to automate manual processes, enhance data analysis and inform investment decisions.</p>
<p>To enhance risk and compliance, they‚Äôre deploying AI to analyze vast amounts of data to identify suspicious activities and anomalous transaction patterns. They‚Äôre also using AI to analyze customer data to predict preferences and deliver personalized marketing campaigns, educational content and targeted promotions.</p>
<p>Companies are already seeing results. Forty-three percent of financial services professionals indicated that AI had improved their operational efficiency, while 42% felt it had helped their business build a competitive advantage.</p>
<h2><strong>A Shift in the Headwinds</strong></h2>
<p>In previous years, the number one challenge respondents reported was recruiting AI experts and data scientists. A 30% increase this year in survey participants resoundingly responded that data-related challenges were the primary concern. This includes data privacy challenges, data sovereignty and data scattered around the globe governed by different oversight regulations.</p>
<p>The growing attention to these issues reflects the advancing power and complexity of AI models, which require huge, diverse datasets to train, as well as increasing regulatory scrutiny and emphasis on responsible AI.</p>
<p>Recruiting and retaining AI experts remains a challenge, as do budget concerns. But more than 60% of respondents are still planning to increase investment in computing infrastructure or optimizing AI workflows, underscoring the importance of these tools in quickly building and deploying trustworthy AI to overcome these barriers.</p>
<h2><strong>Paving the Way for Future Investments</strong></h2>
<p>By and large, the survey results paint a positive picture of AI bringing greater efficiency to operations, personalization to customer engagements, and precision to investment decisions.</p>
<p>Finance professionals agree. Eighty-six percent of respondents reported a positive impact on revenue, while 82% noted a reduction in costs. Fifty-one percent strongly agreed that AI would be important to their company‚Äôs future success, a 76% increase from last year.</p>
<p>With this positive outlook, 97% of companies plan to invest more in AI technologies in the near future. Focus areas for future investments include identifying additional AI use cases, optimizing AI workflows and increasing infrastructure spending.</p>
<p>To build and scale impactful AI across the enterprise, financial services organizations need a comprehensive AI platform that empowers data scientists, quants and developers to seamlessly collaborate while minimizing obstacles. To that end, executives are investing more in AI infrastructure and prioritizing high-yield AI use cases to improve employee productivity while delivering superior customer experiences and investment results.</p>

<h2><b>Cloud‚Äôs-Eye View of CES</b></h2>

<p>Cloud G-SYNC support will match the display refresh rate of variable refresh rate monitors and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/g-sync-monitors/specs/">G-SYNC-compatible monitors</a> to the streaming rate. Paired with new 60 and 120 frames per second streaming options for GeForce NOW Reflex mode, this makes cloud gaming experiences nearly indistinguishable from using a local PC.</p>
<p>Ultimate members will be able to turn their phones into portable gaming rigs with support for 1440p resolutions on compatible Android phones, as well as updated keyboard and mouse support connected through a USB hub. Thanks to the cloud, these smartphones are now capable of PC gaming at Ultimate quality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Ninety-eight percent of retailers plan to invest in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> in the next 18 months, according to a <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/en-us/lp/industries/state-of-ai-in-retail-and-cpg/">new survey</a> conducted by NVIDIA.</p>
<p>That makes retail one of the industries racing fastest to adopt generative AI to ramp up productivity, transform customer experiences and improve efficiency.</p>
<p>Early deployments in the retail industry include personalized shopping advisors and adaptive advertising, with retailers initially testing off-the-shelf models like GPT-4 from OpenAI.</p>
<p>But many are now realizing the value in developing custom models trained on their proprietary data to achieve brand-appropriate tone and personalized results in a scalable, cost-effective way.</p>
<p>Before building them, companies must first consider a variety of questions: whether to opt for an open-source, closed-source or enterprise model; how they plan to train and deploy the models; how to host them; and, most importantly, how to ensure future innovations and new products can be easily incorporated into them.</p>
<p>New offerings like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/">NVIDIA AI Foundations</a>, a curated collection of optimized, enterprise-grade foundation models from NVIDIA and leading open-source pretrained models, are giving retail companies the building blocks they need to construct their custom models. With <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, an end-to-end platform for large language model development, retailers can customize and deploy their models at scale using the latest state-of-the-art techniques.</p>
<h2><b>Generative AI Use Cases¬†</b></h2>
<p>Multimodal models are leading the new frontier in the generative AI landscape. They‚Äôre capable of processing, understanding and generating content and images from multiple sources such as text, image, video and 3D rendered assets.</p>
<p>This allows retailers to create eye-catching images or videos for a brand‚Äôs marketing and advertising campaign using only a few lines of text prompts. Or they can be used to deliver¬† personalized shopping experiences with in-situ and try-on product image results. Yet another use case is in product description generation, where generative AI can intelligently generate detailed e-commerce product descriptions that include product attributes, using meta-tags to greatly improve SEO.</p>
<p>Many retailers are testing the generative AI waters first with internal deployments. For example, some are boosting the productivity of their engineering teams with AI-powered computer code generators that can write optimized lines of code for indicated outcomes. Others are using custom models to generate marketing copy and promotions for various audience segments, increasing click-to-conversion rates. Meanwhile, chatbots and translators are helping employees accomplish their day-to-day tasks.</p>
<p>To enhance customer experiences, retailers are deploying generative AI-powered shopping advisors that can offer personalized product recommendations ‚Äãin customer-tailored conversation styles and display images of products being recommended. It can even display those products if shoppers want to see the recommended product, for example, in their home by uploading a picture of a room. Another use case is a customer service multilingual chatbot capable of answering simple customer inquiries and routing complex ones to human agents for improved, more efficient service.</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA at NRF</b></h2>
<p>To learn more about how generative AI is shaping the future of retail, connect with the NVIDIA team at <a href="https://nrfbigshow.nrf.com/">NRF: Retail‚Äôs Big Show</a>, the world‚Äôs largest retail expo, taking place Jan. 14-16 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The retail industry is in the midst of a major technology transformation, fueled by the rise in AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights">With the highest potential for AI and analytics among all industries</a>, the retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) sectors are poised to harness the power of AI to enhance operational efficiency, elevate customer and employee experiences and drive growth. As such, it‚Äôs crucial to stay ahead of the curve by anticipating potential trends that aim to change the retail game.</p>
<p>NVIDIA‚Äôs first annual ‚Äú<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/en-us/lp/industries/state-of-ai-in-retail-and-cpg/">State of AI in Retail and CPG</a>‚Äù survey ‚Äî conducted among industry professionals ‚Äî provides insights into the state of AI adoption in retail, its impact on revenue and costs and the emerging trends shaping the future of the industry.</p>
<p>With more than 400 respondents globally, including C-suite leaders and other executives, general managers and individual contributors, the survey consisted of questions covering a range of AI topics, top use cases, biggest challenges, infrastructure investment initiatives and deployment models.</p>
<h2><b>Improving Operational Efficiencies Is a Top Priority</b></h2>
<p>To stay ahead in a highly dynamic market, retailers are actively considering how AI can help them meet evolving customer preferences, address labor shortages and drive sustainability efforts. AI has already proved to be a game-changer for retailers, with 69% reporting an increase in annual revenue attributed to AI adoption. Additionally, 72% of retailers using AI experienced a decrease in operating costs.</p>
<p>AI is enhancing operational efficiency, elevating customer experiences and driving growth. The top five current AI use cases were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Store analytics and insights</li>
<li>Personalized customer recommendations</li>
<li>Adaptive advertising, promotions and pricing</li>
<li>Stockout and inventory management</li>
<li>Conversational AI</li>
</ol>
<p>While retailers are actively implementing AI, there are still areas they plan on exploring. These include further investing in AI infrastructure to overcome challenges related to inadequate technology and lack of AI talent, exploring the potential of the metaverse for consumer engagement and operational efficiency while also leveraging AI for brick-and-mortar stores to provide convenience and personalized customer experiences, transforming customer experiences using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>, and ensuring data privacy and protection in generative AI adoption.</p>
<h2><b>Generative AI Is Changing Customer Experiences</b></h2>
<p>Generative AI prominently emerged in several of the top AI use cases for retail. The use cases ranged from multimodal shopping advisors for personalized product recommendations; adaptive advertising, promotions and pricing; product tagging and cataloging; identification of similar and complementary products; as well as deployment of brand avatars for automated customer service.</p>
<p>Retailers recognized the transformative potential of generative AI, with 86% expressing a desire to use it to enhance customer experiences. Respondents acknowledged that incorporating AI into business practices and solutions could revolutionize customer engagement, optimize marketing strategies and streamline operational processes.</p>
<h2><b>Staying Ahead With an Omnichannel Approach</b></h2>
<p>To stay competitive, the survey indicated the importance of an omnichannel approach that integrates numerous online and offline channels to provide consumers with a consistent experience.</p>
<p>The results showed that ecommerce was the most used channel, with 79% of retailers actively participating. Mobile applications also gained traction, with over half of retailers using them to bridge the gap between digital and physical shopping experiences.</p>
<p>Despite the rise in digital shopping, 30% of respondents say physical stores have the biggest revenue growth opportunity (ranked second behind ecommerce) and remain the channel with the most AI use cases for retailers. Given the emphasis on intelligent stores and their central role in the omnichannel experience, use cases such as store analytics and loss prevention will continue to be critical investments.</p>
<h2><b>Investing in AI Infrastructure</b></h2>
<p>While AI adoption is still in its early stages, retailers are committed to increasing their AI infrastructure investments. Over 60% of respondents plan to boost their AI investments in the next 18 months. This commitment reflects the industry‚Äôs recognition of the technology‚Äôs potential to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, elevate customer experiences and drive growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA and the Loss Prevention Research Council (LPRC) are collaborating with several AI companies to showcase a real-time solution for combating and preventing organized retail crime (ORC).</p>
<p>The integrated offering provides advance notifications of suspicious behavior inside and outside stores so that authorities can intervene early.</p>
<p>The LPRC includes asset-protection executives from more than 85 major retail chains, with hundreds of thousands of stores worldwide, as well as law enforcement, consumer packaged goods companies and technology solutions partners. It‚Äôs focused on collaborating with the retail industry to reduce shrink ‚Äî the loss of products for reasons other than sales ‚Äî and increase safety and security at stores and shopping malls.</p>
<p>Flash mobs and smash-and-grab thefts are a growing concern, costing retailers billions of dollars in lost revenue and causing safety concerns among customers and employees. Crime syndicates have committed brazen, large-scale thefts, often selling stolen merchandise on the black market.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/shrink-accounted-over-112-billion-industry-losses-2022-according-nrf#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20survey%2C%20the,65%25)%20of%20retailers'%20shrink.">National Retail Federation survey</a> found that shrink accounted for $112 billion in losses in 2022, with an estimated two-thirds due to theft.</p>
<p>Increasingly, this involves violence. According to the survey, 67% of respondents said they were seeing more violence and aggression associated with organized-crime theft than a year ago.</p>
<p>The AI-based solution, which helps retailers get a jump on often-evasive, fast-moving organized crime groups, uses technology from several leading AI firms that have built their high-performance AI applications on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/intelligent-video-analytics-platform/">NVIDIA Metropolis</a> application framework and microservices.</p>
<p>The solution includes product recognition and tracking, as well as anomaly detection, from AiFi, vehicle license plate and model recognition from BriefCam, and physical security management from SureView to provide advance and real-time notifications to retailer command centers.</p>
<p>The three are among over 500 software companies and startups that have developed retail, safety and security AI applications on NVIDIA Metropolis software development kits for vision AI ‚Äî and that have been certified as NVIDIA Metropolis partners.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe proposed AI-based ORC solution combines LPRC‚Äôs deep expertise in loss prevention from over 23 years of collaboration with asset protection executives with NVIDIA‚Äôs deep AI expertise,‚Äù said Read Hayes, who leads the LPRC and is a University of Florida research scientist and criminologist. ‚ÄúWe believe this type of cross-industry collaboration will help retailers fight back against organized retail crime.‚Äù</p>
<h2><b>Developing Integrated AI for Securing Stores¬†</b></h2>
<p>AiFi, based in Silicon Valley, develops <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-computer-vision/">computer vision</a> solutions, including autonomous retail capabilities built on the NVIDIA Metropolis application framework. Its solution detects anomalies in shopper behavior, tracks items removed from shelves and notifies retailers if shoppers bypass checkout lanes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Generative AI is transforming drug research and development, enabling new discoveries faster than ever ‚Äî and Amgen, one of the world‚Äôs leading biotechnology companies, is tapping the technology to power its research.</p>
<p>Amgen will build AI models trained to analyze one of the world‚Äôs largest human datasets on an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD</a>, a full-stack data center platform, that will be installed at Amgen‚Äôs deCODE genetics‚Äô headquarters in Reykjavik, Iceland. The system will be named Freyja in honor of the powerful, life-giving Norse goddess associated with the ability to predict the future.</p>
<p>Freyja will be used to build a human diversity atlas for drug target and disease-specific biomarker discovery, providing vital diagnostics for monitoring disease progression and regression. The system will also help develop AI-driven precision medicine models, potentially enabling individualized therapies for patients with serious diseases.</p>
<p>Amgen plans to integrate the DGX SuperPOD, which will feature 31 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-h100/">NVIDIA DGX H100</a> nodes totaling 248 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, to train state-of-the-art AI models in days rather than months, enabling researchers to more efficiently analyze and learn from data in their search for novel health and therapeutics insights.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor more than a decade, Amgen has been preparing for this hinge moment we are seeing in the industry, powered by the union of technology and biotechnology,‚Äù said David M. Reese, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Amgen. ‚ÄúWe look forward to¬† combining the breadth and maturity of our world-class human data capabilities at Amgen with NVIDIA‚Äôs technologies.‚Äù</p>
<p>The goal of deCODE founder and CEO K√°ri Stef√°nsson in starting the company was to understand human disease by looking at the diversity of the human genome. He predicted in a recent <a href="https://tslabtalk.podbean.com/e/the-human-data-era-the-role-of-human-diversity-in-progressing-precision-medicine/">Amgen podcast</a> that within the next 10 years, doctors will routinely use genetics to explore uncommon diseases in patients.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis SuperPOD has the potential to accelerate our research by training models more quickly and helping us generate questions we might not have otherwise thought to ask,‚Äù said Stef√°nsson.</p>
<h2><strong>Putting the Tech in Biotechnology</strong></h2>
<p>Since its founding in 1996, deCODE has curated more than 200 petabytes of de-identified human data from nearly 3 million individuals.</p>
<p>The company started by collecting de-identified data from Icelanders, who have a rich heritage in genealogies that stretch back for centuries. This population-scale data from research volunteers provides unique insights into human diversity as it applies to disease.</p>
<p>deCODE has also helped sequence more than half a million human genomes from volunteers in the <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/learn-more-about-uk-biobank/news/world-s-largest-genetic-project-opens-the-door-to-new-era-for-treatments-and-cures-uk-biobank-s-major-milestone">UK Biobank</a>.</p>
<p>But drawing insights from this much data requires powerful AI systems.</p>
<p>By integrating powerful new technology, Amgen has an opportunity to accelerate the discovery and development of life-changing medicines. In March 2023, NVIDIA announced that Amgen became one of the first companies <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-unveils-large-language-models-and-generative-ai-services-to-advance-life-sciences-r-d">to employ NVIDIA BioNeMo</a>, which researchers have used to build generative AI models to accelerate drug discovery and development. Amgen researchers have also been accessing BioNeMo via <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a>, an AI supercomputing service.</p>
<p>‚ÄúModels trained in BioNeMo can advance drug discovery on multiple fronts,‚Äù said Marti Head, executive director of computational and data sciences at Amgen. ‚ÄúIn addition to helping develop drugs that are more effective, they can also help avoid unwanted effects like immune responses, and new biologics can be made in volume.‚Äù</p>
<p>By adopting DGX SuperPOD, Amgen is poised to gain unprecedented data insights with the potential to change the pace and scope of drug discovery.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe fusion of advanced AI, groundbreaking developments in biology and molecular engineering and vast quantities of human data are not just reshaping how we discover and develop new medicines ‚Äî they‚Äôre redefining medicine,‚Äù Reese said.</p>
