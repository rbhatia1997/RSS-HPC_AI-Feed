										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Generative AI is propelling AV 2.0, a new era in autonomous vehicle technology characterized by large, unified, end-to-end AI models capable of managing various aspects of the vehicle stack, including perception, planning and control.</p>
<p>London-based startup Wayve is pioneering this new era, developing autonomous driving technologies that can be built on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/in-vehicle-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DRIVE Orin</a> and its successor NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, which uses the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Blackwell GPU architecture</a> designed for <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-transformer-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transformer</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language model</a> (LLM) and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> workloads.</p>
<p>In contrast to AV 1.0’s focus on refining a vehicle’s perception capabilities using multiple deep neural networks, AV 2.0 calls for comprehensive in-vehicle intelligence to drive decision-making in dynamic, real-world environments.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wayve and NVIDIA: Developing AI Foundation Models for Autonomous Driving" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kx-JJhrs3sU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Wayve, a member of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/startups/?nvid=nv-int-tblg-295718-vt33" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Inception</a> program for cutting-edge startups, specializes in developing AI foundation models for autonomous driving, equipping vehicles with a “robot brain” that can learn from and interact with their surroundings.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA has been the oxygen of everything that allows us to train AI,” said Alex Kendall, cofounder and CEO of Wayve. “We train on NVIDIA GPUs, and the software ecosystem NVIDIA provides allows us to iterate quickly — this is what enables us to build billion-parameter models trained on petabytes of data.”</p>
<p>Generative AI also plays a key role in Wayve’s development process, enabling <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">synthetic data generation</a> so AV makers can use a model’s previous experiences to create and simulate novel driving scenarios.</p>
<p>The company is building embodied AI, a set of technologies that integrate advanced AI into vehicles and robots to transform how they respond to and learn from human behavior, enhancing safety.</p>
<p>Wayve recently announced its Series C investment round — with participation from NVIDIA — that will support the development and launch of the first embodied AI products for production vehicles. As Wayve’s core AI model advances, these products will enable manufacturers to efficiently upgrade cars to higher levels of driving automation, from <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/whats-difference-level-2-level-5-autonomy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">L2+ assisted driving to L4 automated driving</a>.</p>
<p>As part of its embodied AI development, Wayve launched GAIA-1, a generative AI model for autonomy that creates realistic driving videos using video, text and action inputs. It also launched LINGO-2, a driving model that links vision, language and action inputs to explain and determine driving behavior.</p>
<p>“One of the neat things about generative AI is that it allows you to combine different modes of data seamlessly,” Kendall said. “You can bring in the knowledge of all the texts, the general purpose reasoning and capabilities that we get from LLMs and apply that reasoning to driving — this is one of the more promising approaches that we know of to be able to get to true generalized autonomy and eventually L5 capabilities on the road.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Generative AI is enabling new capabilities for Windows applications and games. It’s powering unscripted, dynamic NPCs, it’s enabling creators to generate novel works of art, and it’s helping gamers boost frame rates by up to 4x.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/"><i>AI Decoded series</i></a><i>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for GeForce RTX PC and RTX workstation users.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">Generative AI</a> is enabling new capabilities for Windows applications and games. It’s powering unscripted, dynamic NPCs, it’s enabling creators to generate novel works of art, and it’s helping gamers boost frame rates by up to 4x. But this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>As the capabilities and use cases for generative AI continue to grow, so does the demand for compute to support it.</p>
<p>Hybrid AI combines the onboard AI acceleration of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a> with scalable, cloud-based GPUs to effectively and efficiently meet the demands of AI workloads.</p>
<h2><b>Hybrid AI, a Love Story</b></h2>
<p>With growing AI adoption, app developers are looking for deployment options: AI running locally on RTX GPUs delivers high performance and low latency, and is always available — even when not connected to the internet. On the other hand, AI running in the cloud can run larger models and scale across many GPUs, serving multiple clients simultaneously. In many cases, a single application will use both.</p>
<p>Hybrid AI is a kind of matchmaker that harmonizes local PC and workstation compute with cloud scalability. It provides the flexibility to optimize AI workloads based on specific use cases, cost and performance. It helps developers ensure that AI tasks run where it makes the most sense for their specific applications.</p>
<p>Whether the AI is running locally or in the cloud it gets accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs and NVIDIA’s AI stack, including TensorRT and TensorRT-LLM. That means less time staring at pinwheels of death and more opportunity to deliver cutting-edge, AI powered features to users.</p>
<p>A range of NVIDIA tools and technologies support hybrid AI workflows for creators, gamers, and developers.</p>
<h2><b>Dream in the Cloud, Bring to Life on RTX</b></h2>
<p>Generative AI has demonstrated its ability to help artists ideate, prototype and brainstorm new creations. One such solution, the cloud-based <a href="https://www.istockphoto.com/ai">Generative AI by iStock</a> — powered by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/picasso/">NVIDIA Edify</a> — is a generative photography service that was built for and with artists, training only on licensed content and with compensation for artist contributors.</p>
<p>Generative AI by iStock goes beyond image generation, providing artists with extensive tools to explore styles, variations, modify parts of an image or expand the canvas. With all these tools, artists can ideate numerous times and still bring ideas to life quickly.</p>
<p>Once the creative concept is ready, artists can bring it back to their local systems. RTX-powered PCs and workstations offer artists AI acceleration in more than 125 of the top creative apps to realize the full vision — whether it’s creating an amazing piece of artwork in Photoshop with local AI tools, animating the image with a parallax effect in DaVinci Resolve, or building a 3D scene with the reference image in Blender with ray tracing acceleration, and AI denoising in Optix.</p>
<h2><b>Hybrid ACE Brings NPCs to Life</b></h2>
<p>Hybrid AI is also enabling a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-decoded-ace-microservices-digital-humans/">new realm of interactive PC gaming</a> with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a>, allowing game developers and digital creators to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital avatars on RTX AI PCs.</p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA ACE | NVIDIA x Inworld AI - Pushing the Boundaries of Game Characters in Covert Protocol" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uryeFhnNzEs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Powered by AI neural networks, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a> lets developers and designers create non-playable characters (NPCs) that can understand and respond to human player text and speech. It leverages AI models, including speech-to-text models to handle natural language spoken aloud, to generate NPCs’ responses in real time.</p>
<h2><b>A Hybrid Developer Tool That Runs Anywhere</b></h2>
<p>Hybrid also helps developers build and tune new AI models. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/">NVIDIA AI Workbench</a> helps developers quickly create, test and customize pretrained generative AI models and LLMs on RTX GPUs. It offers streamlined access to popular repositories like Hugging Face, GitHub and <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/?filters=&amp;orderBy=weightPopularDESC&amp;query=&amp;page=&amp;pageSize=">NVIDIA NGC</a>, along with a simplified user interface that enables data scientists and developers to easily reproduce, collaborate on and migrate projects.</p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA AI Workbench | Fine Tuning Generative AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ntMRzPzSvM4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Projects can be easily scaled up when additional performance is needed — whether to the data center, a public cloud or <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a> — and then brought back to local RTX systems on a PC or workstation for inference and light customization. Data scientists and developers can leverage pre-built Workbench projects to chat with documents using retrieval-augmented generation (<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">RAG</a>), customize LLMs using fine-tuning, accelerate data science workloads with seamless CPU-to-GPU transitions and more.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/workbench-example-hybrid-rag">Hybrid RAG Workbench project</a> provides a customizable RAG application that developers can run and adapt themselves. They can embed their documents locally and run inference either on a local RTX system, a cloud endpoint hosted on <a href="http://ai.nvidia.com">NVIDIA’s API catalog</a> or using <a href="http://ai.nvidia.com">NVIDIA NIM</a> microservices. The project can be adapted to use various models, endpoints and containers, and provides the ability for developers to quantize models to run on their GPU of choice.</p>
<p>NVIDIA GPUs power remarkable AI solutions locally on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">NVIDIA GeForce RTX</a> PCs and RTX workstations and in the cloud. Creators, gamers and developers can get the best of both worlds with growing hybrid AI workflows.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>In the latest ranking of the world’s most energy-efficient supercomputers, known as the <a href="https://top500.org/lists/green500/2024/06/">Green500</a>, NVIDIA-powered systems swept the top three spots, and took seven of the top 10.</p>
<p>The strong showing demonstrates how accelerated computing represents the most energy-efficient method for high-performance computing.</p>
<p>The top three systems were all powered by the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/">NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip</a>, showcasing the widespread adoption and efficiency of NVIDIA’s Grace Hopper architecture.</p>
<p>Leading the pack was the JEDI system, at Germany’s <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de">Forschungszentrum Jülich</a>, which achieved an impressive 72.73 GFlops per Watt and is based on Eviden’s BullSequana XH3000 liquid-cooled system.</p>
<p>More’s coming. The ability to do more work using less power is driving the construction of more Grace Hopper supercomputers around the world.</p>
<h2><strong>Accelerating the Green Revolution in Supercomputing</strong></h2>
<p>Such achievements underscore NVIDIA’s pivotal role in advancing the global agenda for sustainable high-performance computing over the past decade.</p>
<p>Accelerated computing has proven to be the cornerstone of energy efficiency, with the majority of systems on the Green500 list — including 40 of the top 50 — now featuring this advanced technology.</p>
<p>Pioneered by NVIDIA, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/#:~:text=Accelerated%20computing%20uses%20parallel%20processing,analytics%20to%20simulations%20and%20visualizations.">accelerated computing</a> uses GPUs that optimize throughput — getting a lot done at once — to perform complex computations faster than systems based on CPUs alone.</p>
<p>And the Grace Hopper architecture is proving to be a game-changer by enhancing computational speed and dramatically increasing energy efficiency across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>For example, the GH200 chip embedded within the Grace Hopper systems offers over 1,000x more energy efficiency on mixed precision and AI tasks than previous generations.</p>
<h2><strong>Redefining Efficiency in Supercomputing</strong></h2>
<p>This capability is crucial for accelerating tasks that address complex scientific challenges, speeding up the work of researchers across various disciplines.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s supercomputing technology excels in traditional benchmarks — and it’s set new standards in energy efficiency.</p>
<p>For instance, the Alps system, at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS), is equipped with NVIDIA Grace Hopper GH200. An optimized subset of the system, dubbed preAlps, placed fifth on the latest Green500. CSCS also submitted the full system to the TOP500 list, recording 270 petaflops on the High-Performance Linpack benchmark, used for solving complex linear equations.</p>
<p>The Green500 rankings highlight platforms that provide highly efficient FP64 performance, which is crucial for accurate simulations used in scientific computing. This result underscores NVIDIA&#8217;s commitment to powering supercomputers for tasks across a full range of capabilities.</p>
<p>This metric demonstrates substantial system performance, leading to its high ranking on the TOP500 list of the world&#8217;s fastest supercomputers. The high position on the Green500 list indicates that this scalable performance does not come at the cost of energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Such performance shows how the Grace Hopper architecture introduces a new era in processing technology, merging tightly coupled CPU and GPU functionalities to enhance not only performance but also significantly improve energy efficiency.</p>
<p>This advancement is supported by the incorporation of an optimized high-efficiency link that moves data between the CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s upcoming <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing">Blackwell platform</a> is set to build on this by offering the computational power of the Titan supercomputer launched 10 years ago — a $100 million system the size of a tennis court — yet be efficient enough to be powered by a wall socket just like a typical home appliance.</p>
<p>In short, over the past decade, NVIDIA innovations have enhanced the accessibility and sustainability of high-performance computing, making scientific breakthroughs faster, cheaper and greener.</p>
<h2><strong>A Future Defined by Sustainable Innovation</strong></h2>
<p>As NVIDIA continues to push the boundaries of what’s possible in high-performance computing, it remains committed to enhancing the energy efficiency of global computing infrastructure.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/audio2face/">NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face</a> app for iClone 8 uses AI to produce expressive facial animations solely from audio input. In addition to generating natural lip-sync animations for multilingual dialogue, the latest standalone release supports multilingual lip-sync and singing animations, as well as full-spectrum editing with slider controls and a keyframe editor.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Audio2Face - AI-Powered Facial &amp; Lip Sync Animation | iClone" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ScMb1f1M9yU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Along with accurate lip-sync, facial animations are significantly enhanced by nuanced facial expressions. Pairing Audio2Face with the iClone AccuFACE plug-in, powered by NVIDIA Maxine, Reallusion provides a flexible and multifaceted approach to facial animation, laying the groundwork with audio tracks and adding subtle expressions with webcams.</p>
<p>These latest AI-powered tools and creative app power ups are available for NVIDIA and GeForce RTX GPU owners.</p>
<h2><b>All Things Small, Bright and Beautiful</b></h2>
<p>China-based 3D visual effects artist Yao Chan finds inspiration and joy in the small things in life.</p>
<p>“As the weather gradually warms up, everything is rejuvenating and flowers are blooming,” said Chan. “I want to create an illustration that captures the warm and bright atmosphere of spring.”</p>
<p>Her 3D scene <i>By the Window</i> closely resembles a corner of her home filled with various succulent plants, pots and neatly arranged gardening tools.</p>
<p>“I think everyone has a place or moment that warms their heart in one way or another, and that&#8217;s an emotion I want to share with my audience,” said the artist.</p>
<p>Chan usually first sketches out her ideas in Adobe Photoshop, but with her real-life reference already set, she dove right into blocking out the scene in Blender.</p>
<p>Since she wanted to use a hand-painted texture style for modeling the vases and pots, Chan added Blender&#8217;s displace modifier and used a Voronoi texture to give the shapes a handcrafted effect.</p>

<p>The Dell NativeEdge platform will automate the delivery of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software, helping developers and IT operators easily deploy AI applications and solutions at the edge. Advancements also include the ability to simplify AI application development for faster time to value with the integration of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> inference microservices, deployment automation and more.</p>
<p>Huang discussed the concept of an AI factory, likening it to the factories of the last industrial revolution that used water to produce electricity. In the current industrial revolution, data centers act as AI factories, transforming data and electricity into valuable data tokens distributed globally.</p>
<p>“What has happened is instead of just producing software, we’re now producing intelligence — that intelligence is formulated in the form of tokens that can then be expressed in any information modality that we’d like it to be,” Huang explained.</p>
<p>Huang underscored the importance of full-stack accelerated computing to enable this, noting NVIDIA’s advancements.</p>
<p>Together, NVIDIA and Dell are providing the world’s industries with a full-stack offering — including computing, networking, storage, services and software — that drives copilots, coding assistants, virtual customer service agents and industrial digital twins.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/corporate/newsroom/announcements/detailpage.press-releases~usa~2024~05~20240520-dell-technologies-expands-dell-ai-factory-with-nvidia-to-turbocharge-ai-adoption.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1716246952240677&amp;usg=AOvVaw239ghwfccj07Z8HHelPXR6">Michael Dell introduced the latest innovations for the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA</a>, emphasizing their ability to simplify and accelerate customers’ AI journeys.</p>
<p>“We are unleashing this super genius power. Everyone is going to have access to this technology — and it&#8217;s gonna get smarter,” Dell said.</p>
<p>The Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA, announced earlier this year, offers a full stack of AI solutions from data center to edge, enabling organizations to quickly adopt and deploy AI at scale.</p>
<p>This platform integrates Dell’s AI capabilities with NVIDIA’s cutting-edge technologies, providing customers with an expansive AI portfolio and an open ecosystem of technology partners.</p>
<p>The Dell AI Factory, based on the NVIDIA partnership, will help establish <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-sovereign-ai/">AI sovereignty</a> for countries by enabling strong data security and customized AI service development.</p>
<p>Together, Dell and NVIDIA will bring these capabilities to companies, help stand it up, and help develop new applications that enterprises can deploy, Huang said.</p>
<p>“Our partnership between us is really about that, literally from the ground up building AI factories and delivering it to the world’s enterprises as a solution,” Huang said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Senior executives from NVIDIA, Siemens and Teradyne Robotics gathered this week in Odense, Denmark, to mark the launch of Teradyne Robotics’ new headquarters and discuss the massive advances coming to the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/robotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robotics industry</a>.</p>
<p>One of Denmark’s oldest cities and known as the city of robotics, Odense is home to over 160 robotics companies with 3,700 employees and contributes profoundly to the industry’s progress.</p>
<p>Teradyne Robotics’ new hub there, which includes cobot company Universal Robots (UR) and autonomous mobile robot (AMR) company MiR, is set to help employees maximize collaborative efforts, foster innovation and provide an environment to revolutionize advanced robotics and autonomous machines.</p>
<p>The grand opening showcased the latest AI robotic applications and featured a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llKhAC5ncfs">panel discussion</a> on the future of advanced robotics. Speakers included Ujjwal Kumar, group president at Teradyne Robotics; Rainer Brehm, CEO of Siemens Factory Automation; and Deepu Talla, vice president of robotics and edge computing at NVIDIA.</p>
<p>“The advent of generative AI coupled with simulation and digital twins technology is at a tipping point right now, and that combination is going to change the trajectory of robotics,” commented Talla.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Future of Advanced Robotics feat. NVIDIA, SIEMENS and TERADYNE" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/llKhAC5ncfs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>The Power of Partnerships</b></h2>
<p>The discussion comes as the global robotics market continues to grow rapidly. The <a href="https://statzon.com/insights/global-collaborative-robot-market">cobots market in Europe</a> was valued at $286 million in 2022 and is projected to reach $6.7 billion by 2032, at a yearly growth rate of more than 37%.</p>
<p>Panelists discussed why teaming up is key to innovation for any company — whether a startup or an enterprise — and how physical AI is being used across businesses and workplaces, stressing the game-changing impact of advanced robotics.</p>
<p>The alliance between NVIDIA and Teradyne Robotics, which includes an AI-based intra-logistics solution alongside Siemens, showcases the strength of collaboration across the ecosystem. NVIDIA’s prominent role as a physical AI hardware provider is boosting the cobot and AMR sectors with accelerated computing, while its collaboration with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/industrial-sector/siemens/">Siemens</a> is transforming industrial automation.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA provides all the core AI capabilities that get integrated into the hundreds and thousands of companies building robotic platforms and robots, so our approach is 100% collaboration,” Talla said.</p>
<p>“What excites me most about AI and robots is that collaboration is at the core of solving our customers’ problems,” Kumar added. “No one company has all the technologies needed to address these problems, so we must work together to understand and solve them at a very fast pace.”</p>
<h2><b>Accelerating Innovation With AI </b></h2>
<p>AI has already made huge strides across industries and plays an important role in enhancing advanced robotics. Leveraging machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing, AI gives robots the cognitive capability to understand, learn and make decisions.</p>
<p>“For humans, we have our senses, but it’s not that easy for a robot, so you have to build these AI capabilities for autonomous navigation,” Talla said. “<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA’s Isaac platform</a> is enabling increased autonomy in robotics with rapid advancements in simulation, generative AI, foundation models and optimized edge computing.”</p>
<p>NVIDIA is working closely with the UR team to infuse AI into UR’s robotics software technology. In the case of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/isaac-amr-nova-orin-autonomous-mobile-robots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">autonomous mobile robots</a> that move things from point A to B to C, it’s all about operating in unstructured environments and navigating autonomously.</p>
<p>Brehm emphasized the need to scale AI by industrializing it, allowing for automated deployment, inference and monitoring of models — making AI easily accessible on the shopfloor. He spoke about empowering customers to utilize AI effortlessly, even without AI expertise. “Our goal is to advance automation, moving towards a system that leverages skills-based automation in the future,” he said.</p>
<p>As a leading robotics company with one of the largest installed bases of collaborative and AMRs, Teradyne has identified a long list of industry problems and is working closely with NVIDIA to solve them.</p>
<p>“I use the term ‘physical AI’ as opposed to ‘digital AI’ because we are taking AI to a whole new level by applying it in the physical world,” said Kumar. “We see it helping our customers in three ways: adding new capabilities to our robots, making our robots smarter with advanced path planning and navigation, and further enhancing the safety and reliability of our collaborative robots.”</p>
<h2><b>The Impact of Real-World Robotics</b></h2>
<p>Autonomous machines, or AI robots, are already making a noticeable difference in the real world, from industries to our daily lives. Industries such as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/manufacturing/">manufacturing</a> are using advanced robotics to enhance efficiency, accuracy and productivity.</p>
<p>Companies want to produce goods close to where they are consumed, with sustainability being a key driver. But this often means setting up shop in high-cost countries. The challenge is twofold: producing at competitive prices and dealing with shrinking, aging workforces that are less available for factory jobs.</p>
<p>“The problem for large manufacturers is the same as what small and medium manufacturers have always faced: variability,” Kumar said. “High-volume industrial robots don’t suit applications requiring continuous design tweaks. Collaborative robots combined with AI offer solutions to the pain points that small and medium customers have lived with for years, and to the new challenges now faced by large manufacturers.”</p>
<p>Automation isn’t just about making things faster; it’s also about making the most of the workforce. In manufacturing, automation aids smoother processes, ramps up safety, saves time and relieves pressure on employees.</p>
<p>“Automation is crucial for solving problems and, to get there, AI is a game-changer. If you don’t have the people who want to work in the factory, and you don&#8217;t have the people to program the automation, you won’t have the flexibility to automate what you need in the future. And that’s what drives our customers,” Brehm said.</p>
<p>AI and computing technologies are set to redefine the robotics landscape, transforming robots from mere tools to intelligent partners capable of autonomy and adaptability across industries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>A collaboration between NVIDIA and academic researchers is prepping robots for surgery.</p>
<p>ORBIT-Surgical — developed by researchers from the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley, ETH Zurich, Georgia Tech and NVIDIA — is a simulation framework to train robots that could augment the skills of surgical teams while reducing surgeons’ cognitive load.</p>
<p>It supports more than a dozen maneuvers inspired by the training curriculum for laparoscopic procedures, aka minimally invasive surgery, such as grasping small objects like needles, passing them from one arm to another and placing them with high precision.</p>
<p>The physics-based framework was built using <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim">NVIDIA Isaac Sim</a>, a robotics simulation platform for designing, training and testing AI-based robots. The researchers trained reinforcement learning and imitation learning algorithms on NVIDIA GPUs and used <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform for developing and deploying advanced 3D applications and pipelines based on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description</a> (OpenUSD), to enable photorealistic rendering.</p>
<p>Using the community-supported da Vinci Research Kit, provided by the Intuitive Foundation, a nonprofit supported by robotic surgery leader Intuitive Surgical, the ORBIT-Surgical research team demonstrated how training a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-twin/">digital twin</a> in simulation transfers to a physical robot in a lab environment in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="ORBIT-Surgical: An Open-Simulation Framework for Learning Surgical Augmented Dexterity" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NA3xCRHcZsE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>ORBIT-Surgical will be <a href="https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/conferences/ICRA24/program/ICRA24_ContentListWeb_3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented Thursday at ICRA</a>, the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, taking place this week in Yokohama, Japan. The open-source code package is <a href="https://orbit-surgical.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2><b>A Stitch in AI Saves Nine</b></h2>
<p>ORBIT-Surgical is based on <a href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/isaac_gym_tutorials/ext_omni_isaac_orbit.html">Isaac Orbit</a>, a modular framework for robot learning built on Isaac Sim. Orbit includes support for various libraries for <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning-gpus-robotics/">reinforcement learning</a> and imitation learning, where AI agents are trained to mimic ground-truth expert examples.</p>
<p>The surgical framework enables developers to train robots like the da Vinci Research Kit robot, or dVRK, to manipulate both rigid and soft objects using reinforcement learning and imitation learning frameworks running on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/desktop-graphics/">NVIDIA RTX GPUs</a>.</p>
<p>ORBIT-Surgical introduces more than a dozen benchmark tasks for surgical training, including one-handed tasks such as picking up a piece of gauze, inserting a shunt into a blood vessel or lifting a suture needle to a specific position. It also includes two-handed tasks, like handing a needle from one arm to another, passing a threaded needle through a ring pole and reaching two arms to specific positions while avoiding obstacles.</p>
<div style="width: 1920px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-71604-1" width="1920" height="1080" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Shunt-Insertion_Real-Sim.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Shunt-Insertion_Real-Sim.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Shunt-Insertion_Real-Sim.mp4</a></video></div>
<p><em>One of ORBIT-Surgical&#8217;s benchmark tests is inserting a shunt — shown on left with a real-world robot and on right in simulation. </em></p>
<p>By developing a surgical simulator that takes advantage of GPU acceleration and parallelization, the team is able to boost robot learning speed by an order of magnitude compared to existing surgical frameworks. They found that the robot digital twin could be trained to complete tasks like inserting a shunt and lifting a suture needle in under two hours on a single NVIDIA RTX GPU.</p>
<p>With the visual realism enabled by rendering in Omniverse, ORBIT-Surgical also allows researchers to generate high-fidelity synthetic data, which could help train AI models for perception tasks such as segmenting surgical tools in real-world videos captured in the operating room.</p>
<p>A proof of concept by the team showed that combining simulation and real data significantly improved the accuracy of an AI model to segment surgical needles from images — helping reduce the need for large, expensive real-world datasets for training such models.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Mozilla Firefox, the popular open-source browser, is the latest partner to incorporate NVIDIA RTX Video, a technology that uses AI to improve video quality on Windows PCs and workstations. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><em>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </em><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>AI Decoded series</em></a><em>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and which showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.</em></p>
<p>Mozilla Firefox, the popular open-source browser, is the latest partner to incorporate NVIDIA RTX Video, a technology that uses AI to improve video quality on Windows PCs and workstations. The browser’s latest release taps local <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/desktop-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX GPUs</a> to make streaming and video better than ever.</p>
<h2><strong>Pixel Perfect</strong></h2>
<p>First announced at CES in January 2023, RTX Video is a collection of AI video enhancements that improve the quality of videos played on browsers through platforms like YouTube, Prime Video and Disney+. The technology makes videos streamed on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA GeForce RTX</a>-powered PCs and RTX-powered workstations appear sharper and more detailed without requiring a higher-resolution source.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Introducing RTX Video HDR: AI-Upscale Video to HDR Quality" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hlrk_qqqUNA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>RTX Video is made up of two parts. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-video-super-resolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Video Super Resolution</a> upscales low-resolution video for cleaner, crisper imagery. It works by analyzing the lower-resolution video and using deep learning to predict what the higher-resolution version should look like. The algorithm then combines this predicted image with a traditionally upscaled version to reduce or eliminate compression artifacts and sharpen the final output.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-video-hdr-remix-studio-driver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Video HDR</a> goes one step further: when enabled, it analyzes standard dynamic range (SDR) video content through AI neural networks to add high-dynamic range (HDR) information, improving visibility, details and vibrancy.</p>
<p>Since 90% of video online is 1080p or lower and SDR, enabling RTX Video is like pushing the “remaster” button on most of the content users watch everyday.</p>
<h2><strong>Pretty Foxy</strong></h2>
<p>Mozilla Firefox now supports RTX Video Super Resolution and HDR in its latest stable version (v126). It’s never been easier for users to access AI-enhanced upscaling, de-artifacting and HDR effects for online videos.</p>
<p>“Video is a core pillar of the modern web, and we are committed to delivering a great experience for our users,” said Bobby Holley, chief technology officer of Firefox at Mozilla. “Mozilla is integrating RTX Video into Firefox to improve video quality for our users with compatible GPUs.”</p>
<p>Firefox joins other Chromium-based browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, in supporting RTX Video. RTX Video Super Resolution is also supported in popular video players like VLC.</p>
<p>Enabling RTX Video is easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Update to the latest GeForce RTX Game Ready Driver, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/">NVIDIA Studio</a> or NVIDIA RTX Enterprise Driver.</li>
<li>Ensure Windows HDR features are enabled by navigating to System &gt; Display &gt; HDR.</li>
<li>Open the NVIDIA Control Panel and navigate to Adjust Video Image Settings &gt; RTX Video Enhancement.</li>
<li>Turn on “Super Resolution” and “High Dynamic Range.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that RTX Video HDR requires an NVIDIA GeForce RTX or RTX professional GPU connected to an HDR10-compatible monitor or TV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Large language models that power generative AI are seeing intense innovation — models that handle multiple types of data such as text, image and sounds are becoming increasingly common.</p>
<p>However, building and deploying these models remains challenging. Developers need a way to quickly experience and evaluate models to determine the best fit for their use case, and then optimize the model for performance in a way that not only is cost-effective but offers the best performance.</p>
<p>To make it easier for developers to create AI-powered applications with world-class performance, NVIDIA and Google today announced three new collaborations at Google I/O ‘24.</p>
<h2><b>Gemma + NIM</b></h2>
<p>Using <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-supercharges-large-language-model-inference-on-nvidia-h100-gpus/">TensorRT-LLM</a>, NVIDIA is working with Google to optimize two new models it introduced at the event: Gemma 2 and PaliGemma. These models are built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models, and each is focused on a specific area:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gemma 2 </b>is the next generation of Gemma models for a broad range of use cases and features a brand new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency.</li>
<li><b>PaliGemma</b> is an open vision language model (VLM) inspired by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09199">PaLI-3</a>. Built on open components including the SigLIP vision model and the Gemma language model, PaliGemma is designed for vision-language tasks such as image and short video captioning, visual question answering, understanding text in images, object detection and object segmentation. PaliGemma is designed for class-leading fine-tuning performance on a wide range of vision-language tasks and is also supported by <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/JAX-Toolbox">NVIDIA JAX-Toolbox</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gemma 2 and PaliGemma will be offered with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> inference microservices, part of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform, which simplifies the deployment of AI models at scale. NIM support for the two new models are available from the API catalog, starting with <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/google/google-paligemma">PaliGemma</a> today; they soon will be released as containers on <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/">NVIDIA NGC</a> and GitHub.</p>
<h2><b>Bringing Accelerated Data Analytics to Colab</b></h2>
<p>Google also announced that <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/rapids-cudf-accelerates-pandas-nearly-150x-with-zero-code-changes/">RAPIDS cuDF, an open-source GPU dataframe library</a>, is now supported by default on Google Colab, one of the most popular developer platforms for data scientists. It now takes just a few seconds for <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/democratizing-access-to-ai-enabled-coding-with-colab/">Google Colab’s 10 million monthly users</a> to accelerate pandas-based Python workflows by up to 50x using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/l4/">NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, with zero code changes.</p>
<p>With RAPIDS cuDF, developers using Google Colab can speed up exploratory analysis and production data pipelines. While pandas is one of the world’s most popular data processing tools due to its intuitive API, applications often struggle as their data sizes grow. With even 5-10GB of data, many simple operations can take minutes to finish on a CPU, slowing down exploratory analysis and production data pipelines.</p>
<p>RAPIDS cuDF is designed to solve this problem by seamlessly accelerating pandas code on GPUs where applicable, and falling back to CPU-pandas where not. With RAPIDS cuDF available by default on Colab, all developers everywhere can leverage accelerated data analytics.</p>
<h2><b>Taking AI on the Road </b></h2>
<p>By employing AI PCs using NVIDIA RTX graphics, Google and NVIDIA also announced a Firebase Genkit collaboration that enables app developers to easily integrate generative AI models, like the new family of Gemma models, into their web and mobile applications to deliver custom content, provide semantic search and answer questions. Developers can start work streams using local RTX GPUs before moving their work seamlessly to Google Cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>To make this even easier, developers can build apps with Genkit using JavaScript, a programming language mobile developers commonly use to build their apps.</p>
<h2><b>The Innovation Beat Goes On</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA and Google Cloud are collaborating in multiple domains to propel AI forward. From the upcoming Grace Blackwell-powered DGX Cloud platform and JAX framework support, to bringing the NVIDIA NeMo framework to Google Kubernetes Engine, the companies’ full-stack partnership expands the possibilities of what customers can do with AI using NVIDIA technologies on Google Cloud.</p>
