										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Senior executives from NVIDIA, Siemens and Teradyne Robotics gathered this week in Odense, Denmark, to mark the launch of Teradyne Robotics’ new headquarters and discuss the massive advances coming to the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/robotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robotics industry</a>.</p>
<p>One of Denmark’s oldest cities and known as the city of robotics, Odense is home to over 160 robotics companies with 3,700 employees and contributes profoundly to the industry’s progress.</p>
<p>Teradyne Robotics’ new hub there, which includes cobot company Universal Robots (UR) and autonomous mobile robot (AMR) company MiR, is set to help employees maximize collaborative efforts, foster innovation and provide an environment to revolutionize advanced robotics and autonomous machines.</p>
<p>The grand opening showcased the latest AI robotic applications and featured a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llKhAC5ncfs">panel discussion</a> on the future of advanced robotics. Speakers included Ujjwal Kumar, group president at Teradyne Robotics; Rainer Brehm, CEO of Siemens Factory Automation; and Deepu Talla, vice president of robotics and edge computing at NVIDIA.</p>
<p>“The advent of generative AI coupled with simulation and digital twins technology is at a tipping point right now, and that combination is going to change the trajectory of robotics,” commented Talla.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Future of Advanced Robotics feat. NVIDIA, SIEMENS and TERADYNE" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/llKhAC5ncfs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>The Power of Partnerships</b></h2>
<p>The discussion comes as the global robotics market continues to grow rapidly. The <a href="https://statzon.com/insights/global-collaborative-robot-market">cobots market in Europe</a> was valued at $286 million in 2022 and is projected to reach $6.7 billion by 2032, at a yearly growth rate of more than 37%.</p>
<p>Panelists discussed why teaming up is key to innovation for any company — whether a startup or an enterprise — and how physical AI is being used across businesses and workplaces, stressing the game-changing impact of advanced robotics.</p>
<p>The alliance between NVIDIA and Teradyne Robotics, which includes an AI-based intra-logistics solution alongside Siemens, showcases the strength of collaboration across the ecosystem. NVIDIA’s prominent role as a physical AI hardware provider is boosting the cobot and AMR sectors with accelerated computing, while its collaboration with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/industrial-sector/siemens/">Siemens</a> is transforming industrial automation.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA provides all the core AI capabilities that get integrated into the hundreds and thousands of companies building robotic platforms and robots, so our approach is 100% collaboration,” Talla said.</p>
<p>“What excites me most about AI and robots is that collaboration is at the core of solving our customers’ problems,” Kumar added. “No one company has all the technologies needed to address these problems, so we must work together to understand and solve them at a very fast pace.”</p>
<h2><b>Accelerating Innovation With AI </b></h2>
<p>AI has already made huge strides across industries and plays an important role in enhancing advanced robotics. Leveraging machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing, AI gives robots the cognitive capability to understand, learn and make decisions.</p>
<p>“For humans, we have our senses, but it’s not that easy for a robot, so you have to build these AI capabilities for autonomous navigation,” Talla said. “<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA’s Isaac platform</a> is enabling increased autonomy in robotics with rapid advancements in simulation, generative AI, foundation models and optimized edge computing.”</p>
<p>NVIDIA is working closely with the UR team to infuse AI into UR’s robotics software technology. In the case of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/isaac-amr-nova-orin-autonomous-mobile-robots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">autonomous mobile robots</a> that move things from point A to B to C, it’s all about operating in unstructured environments and navigating autonomously.</p>
<p>Brehm emphasized the need to scale AI by industrializing it, allowing for automated deployment, inference and monitoring of models — making AI easily accessible on the shopfloor. He spoke about empowering customers to utilize AI effortlessly, even without AI expertise. “Our goal is to advance automation, moving towards a system that leverages skills-based automation in the future,” he said.</p>
<p>As a leading robotics company with one of the largest installed bases of collaborative and AMRs, Teradyne has identified a long list of industry problems and is working closely with NVIDIA to solve them.</p>
<p>“I use the term ‘physical AI’ as opposed to ‘digital AI’ because we are taking AI to a whole new level by applying it in the physical world,” said Kumar. “We see it helping our customers in three ways: adding new capabilities to our robots, making our robots smarter with advanced path planning and navigation, and further enhancing the safety and reliability of our collaborative robots.”</p>
<h2><b>The Impact of Real-World Robotics</b></h2>
<p>Autonomous machines, or AI robots, are already making a noticeable difference in the real world, from industries to our daily lives. Industries such as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/manufacturing/">manufacturing</a> are using advanced robotics to enhance efficiency, accuracy and productivity.</p>
<p>Companies want to produce goods close to where they are consumed, with sustainability being a key driver. But this often means setting up shop in high-cost countries. The challenge is twofold: producing at competitive prices and dealing with shrinking, aging workforces that are less available for factory jobs.</p>
<p>“The problem for large manufacturers is the same as what small and medium manufacturers have always faced: variability,” Kumar said. “High-volume industrial robots don’t suit applications requiring continuous design tweaks. Collaborative robots combined with AI offer solutions to the pain points that small and medium customers have lived with for years, and to the new challenges now faced by large manufacturers.”</p>
<p>Automation isn’t just about making things faster; it’s also about making the most of the workforce. In manufacturing, automation aids smoother processes, ramps up safety, saves time and relieves pressure on employees.</p>
<p>“Automation is crucial for solving problems and, to get there, AI is a game-changer. If you don’t have the people who want to work in the factory, and you don&#8217;t have the people to program the automation, you won’t have the flexibility to automate what you need in the future. And that’s what drives our customers,” Brehm said.</p>
<p>AI and computing technologies are set to redefine the robotics landscape, transforming robots from mere tools to intelligent partners capable of autonomy and adaptability across industries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>A collaboration between NVIDIA and academic researchers is prepping robots for surgery.</p>
<p>ORBIT-Surgical — developed by researchers from the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley, ETH Zurich, Georgia Tech and NVIDIA — is a simulation framework to train robots that could augment the skills of surgical teams while reducing surgeons’ cognitive load.</p>
<p>It supports more than a dozen maneuvers inspired by the training curriculum for laparoscopic procedures, aka minimally invasive surgery, such as grasping small objects like needles, passing them from one arm to another and placing them with high precision.</p>
<p>The physics-based framework was built using <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim">NVIDIA Isaac Sim</a>, a robotics simulation platform for designing, training and testing AI-based robots. The researchers trained reinforcement learning and imitation learning algorithms on NVIDIA GPUs and used <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform for developing and deploying advanced 3D applications and pipelines based on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description</a> (OpenUSD), to enable photorealistic rendering.</p>
<p>Using the community-supported da Vinci Research Kit, provided by the Intuitive Foundation, a nonprofit supported by robotic surgery leader Intuitive Surgical, the ORBIT-Surgical research team demonstrated how training a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-twin/">digital twin</a> in simulation transfers to a physical robot in a lab environment in the video below.</p>

<p>ORBIT-Surgical will be <a href="https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/conferences/ICRA24/program/ICRA24_ContentListWeb_3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented Thursday at ICRA</a>, the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, taking place this week in Yokohama, Japan. The open-source code package is <a href="https://orbit-surgical.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2><b>A Stitch in AI Saves Nine</b></h2>
<p>ORBIT-Surgical is based on <a href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/isaac_gym_tutorials/ext_omni_isaac_orbit.html">Isaac Orbit</a>, a modular framework for robot learning built on Isaac Sim. Orbit includes support for various libraries for <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning-gpus-robotics/">reinforcement learning</a> and imitation learning, where AI agents are trained to mimic ground-truth expert examples.</p>
<p>The surgical framework enables developers to train robots like the da Vinci Research Kit robot, or dVRK, to manipulate both rigid and soft objects using reinforcement learning and imitation learning frameworks running on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/desktop-graphics/">NVIDIA RTX GPUs</a>.</p>
<p>ORBIT-Surgical introduces more than a dozen benchmark tasks for surgical training, including one-handed tasks such as picking up a piece of gauze, inserting a shunt into a blood vessel or lifting a suture needle to a specific position. It also includes two-handed tasks, like handing a needle from one arm to another, passing a threaded needle through a ring pole and reaching two arms to specific positions while avoiding obstacles.</p>
<div style="width: 1920px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-71604-1" width="1920" height="1080" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Shunt-Insertion_Real-Sim.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Shunt-Insertion_Real-Sim.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Shunt-Insertion_Real-Sim.mp4</a></video></div>
<p><em>One of ORBIT-Surgical&#8217;s benchmark tests is inserting a shunt — shown on left with a real-world robot and on right in simulation. </em></p>
<p>By developing a surgical simulator that takes advantage of GPU acceleration and parallelization, the team is able to boost robot learning speed by an order of magnitude compared to existing surgical frameworks. They found that the robot digital twin could be trained to complete tasks like inserting a shunt and lifting a suture needle in under two hours on a single NVIDIA RTX GPU.</p>
<p>With the visual realism enabled by rendering in Omniverse, ORBIT-Surgical also allows researchers to generate high-fidelity synthetic data, which could help train AI models for perception tasks such as segmenting surgical tools in real-world videos captured in the operating room.</p>
<p>A proof of concept by the team showed that combining simulation and real data significantly improved the accuracy of an AI model to segment surgical needles from images — helping reduce the need for large, expensive real-world datasets for training such models.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Mozilla Firefox, the popular open-source browser, is the latest partner to incorporate NVIDIA RTX Video, a technology that uses AI to improve video quality on Windows PCs and workstations. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><em>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </em><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>AI Decoded series</em></a><em>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and which showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.</em></p>
<p>Mozilla Firefox, the popular open-source browser, is the latest partner to incorporate NVIDIA RTX Video, a technology that uses AI to improve video quality on Windows PCs and workstations. The browser’s latest release taps local <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/desktop-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX GPUs</a> to make streaming and video better than ever.</p>
<h2><strong>Pixel Perfect</strong></h2>
<p>First announced at CES in January 2023, RTX Video is a collection of AI video enhancements that improve the quality of videos played on browsers through platforms like YouTube, Prime Video and Disney+. The technology makes videos streamed on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA GeForce RTX</a>-powered PCs and RTX-powered workstations appear sharper and more detailed without requiring a higher-resolution source.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Introducing RTX Video HDR: AI-Upscale Video to HDR Quality" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hlrk_qqqUNA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>RTX Video is made up of two parts. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-video-super-resolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Video Super Resolution</a> upscales low-resolution video for cleaner, crisper imagery. It works by analyzing the lower-resolution video and using deep learning to predict what the higher-resolution version should look like. The algorithm then combines this predicted image with a traditionally upscaled version to reduce or eliminate compression artifacts and sharpen the final output.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-video-hdr-remix-studio-driver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Video HDR</a> goes one step further: when enabled, it analyzes standard dynamic range (SDR) video content through AI neural networks to add high-dynamic range (HDR) information, improving visibility, details and vibrancy.</p>
<p>Since 90% of video online is 1080p or lower and SDR, enabling RTX Video is like pushing the “remaster” button on most of the content users watch everyday.</p>
<h2><strong>Pretty Foxy</strong></h2>
<p>Mozilla Firefox now supports RTX Video Super Resolution and HDR in its latest stable version (v126). It’s never been easier for users to access AI-enhanced upscaling, de-artifacting and HDR effects for online videos.</p>
<p>“Video is a core pillar of the modern web, and we are committed to delivering a great experience for our users,” said Bobby Holley, chief technology officer of Firefox at Mozilla. “Mozilla is integrating RTX Video into Firefox to improve video quality for our users with compatible GPUs.”</p>
<p>Firefox joins other Chromium-based browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, in supporting RTX Video. RTX Video Super Resolution is also supported in popular video players like VLC.</p>
<p>Enabling RTX Video is easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Update to the latest GeForce RTX Game Ready Driver, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/">NVIDIA Studio</a> or NVIDIA RTX Enterprise Driver.</li>
<li>Ensure Windows HDR features are enabled by navigating to System &gt; Display &gt; HDR.</li>
<li>Open the NVIDIA Control Panel and navigate to Adjust Video Image Settings &gt; RTX Video Enhancement.</li>
<li>Turn on “Super Resolution” and “High Dynamic Range.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that RTX Video HDR requires an NVIDIA GeForce RTX or RTX professional GPU connected to an HDR10-compatible monitor or TV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><span>Large language models that power generative AI are seeing intense innovation — models that handle multiple types of data such as text, image and sounds are becoming increasingly common. </span></p>
<p><span>However, building and deploying these models remains challenging. Developers need a way to quickly experience and evaluate models to determine the best fit for their use case, and then optimize the model for performance in a way that not only is cost-effective but offers the best performance.</span></p>
<p><span>To make it easier for developers to create AI-powered applications with world-class performance, NVIDIA and Google today announced three new collaborations at Google I/O ‘24. </span></p>
<h2><b>Gemma + NIM</b></h2>
<p><span>Using </span><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-supercharges-large-language-model-inference-on-nvidia-h100-gpus/"><span>TensorRT-LLM</span></a><span>, NVIDIA is working with Google to optimize two new models it introduced at the event: Gemma 2 and PaliGemma. These models are built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models, and each is focused on a specific area: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gemma 2 </b><span>is the next generation of Gemma models for a broad range of use cases and features a brand new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency.</span></li>
<li><b>PaliGemma</b><span> is an open vision language model (VLM) inspired by </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09199"><span>PaLI-3</span></a><span>. Built on open components including the SigLIP vision model and the Gemma language model, PaliGemma is designed for vision-language tasks such as image and short video captioning, visual question answering, understanding text in images, object detection and object segmentation. PaliGemma is designed for class-leading fine-tuning performance on a wide range of vision-language tasks and is also supported by </span><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/JAX-Toolbox"><span>NVIDIA JAX-Toolbox</span></a><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Gemma 2 and PaliGemma will be offered with </span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/"><span>NVIDIA NIM</span></a><span> inference microservices, part of the </span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/"><span>NVIDIA AI Enterprise</span></a><span> software platform, which simplifies the deployment of AI models at scale. NIM support for the two new models are available from the API catalog, starting with </span><a href="https://build.ngc.nvidia.com/google/google-paligemma"><span>PaliGemma</span></a><span> today; they soon will be released as containers on </span><a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/"><span>NVIDIA NGC</span></a><span> and GitHub. </span></p>
<h2><b>Bringing Accelerated Data Analytics to Colab</b></h2>
<p>Google also announced that <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/rapids-cudf-accelerates-pandas-nearly-150x-with-zero-code-changes/">RAPIDS cuDF, an open-source GPU dataframe library</a>, is now supported by default on Google Colab, one of the most popular developer platforms for data scientists. It now takes just a few seconds for <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/democratizing-access-to-ai-enabled-coding-with-colab/">Google Colab’s 10 million monthly users</a> to accelerate pandas-based Python workflows by up to 50x using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/l4/">NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, with zero code changes.</p>
<p>With RAPIDS cuDF, developers using Google Colab can speed up exploratory analysis and production data pipelines. While pandas is one of the world’s most popular data processing tools due to its intuitive API, applications often struggle as their data sizes grow. With even 5-10GB of data, many simple operations can take minutes to finish on a CPU, slowing down exploratory analysis and production data pipelines.</p>
<p>RAPIDS cuDF is designed to solve this problem by seamlessly accelerating pandas code on GPUs where applicable, and falling back to CPU-pandas where not. With RAPIDS cuDF available by default on Colab, all developers everywhere can leverage accelerated data analytics.</p>
<h2><b>Taking AI on the Road </b></h2>
<p>By employing AI PCs using NVIDIA RTX graphics, Google and NVIDIA also announced a Firebase Genkit collaboration that enables app developers to easily integrate generative AI models, like the new family of Gemma models, into their web and mobile applications to deliver custom content, provide semantic search and answer questions. Developers can start work streams using local RTX GPUs before moving their work seamlessly to Google Cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>To make this even easier, developers can build apps with Genkit using JavaScript, a programming language mobile developers commonly use to build their apps.</p>
<h2><b>The Innovation Beat Goes On</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA and Google Cloud are collaborating in multiple domains to propel AI forward. From the upcoming Grace Blackwell-powered DGX Cloud platform and JAX framework support, to bringing the NVIDIA NeMo framework to Google Kubernetes Engine, the companies’ full-stack partnership expands the possibilities of what customers can do with AI using NVIDIA technologies on Google Cloud.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Following an announcement by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, NVIDIA will play a central role in developing the nation’s generative AI infrastructure as Japan seeks to capitalize on the technology’s economic potential and further develop its workforce.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is collaborating with key digital infrastructure providers, including GMO Internet Group, Highreso, KDDI Corporation, RUTILEA, SAKURA internet Inc. and SoftBank Corp., which the ministry has certified to spearhead the development of cloud infrastructure crucial for AI applications.</p>
<p>Over the last two months, the ministry announced plans to allocate $740 million, approximately ¥114.6 billion, to assist six local firms in this initiative. Following on from last year, this is a significant effort by the Japanese government to subsidize AI computing resources, by expanding the number of companies involved.</p>
<p>With this move, Japan becomes the latest nation to embrace the concept of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-sovereign-ai/">sovereign AI</a>, aiming to fortify its local startups, enterprises and research efforts with advanced AI technologies.</p>
<p>Across the globe, nations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models. Some procure and operate sovereign AI clouds with state-owned <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/telecommunications/ai-factories/">telecommunications providers</a> or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public and private sector use.</p>
<p>Japan’s initiative follows NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang&#8217;s visit last year, where he met with political and business leaders — including Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida — to discuss the future of AI.</p>
<p>During his trip, Huang emphasized that “AI factories” — next-generation data centers designed to handle the most computationally intensive AI tasks — are crucial for turning vast amounts of data into intelligence. “The AI factory will become the bedrock of modern economies across the world,” Huang said during a meeting with the Japanese press in December.</p>
<p>The Japanese government plans to subsidize a significant portion of the costs for building AI supercomputers, which will facilitate AI adoption, enhance workforce skills, support Japanese language model development and bolster resilience against natural disasters and climate change.</p>
<p>Under the country’s Economic Security Promotion Act, the ministry aims to secure a stable supply of local cloud services, reducing the time and cost of developing next-generation AI technologies.</p>
<p>Japan’s technology powerhouses are already moving fast to embrace AI. Last week, SoftBank Corp. announced that it will invest ¥150 billion, approximately $960 million, for its plan to expand the infrastructure needed to develop Japan’s top-class AI, including purchases of NVIDIA accelerated computing.</p>
<p>The news follows Huang’s meetings with leaders in Canada, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam over the past year, as countries seek to supercharge their regional economies and embrace challenges such as climate change with AI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Described as the largest system in the pharmaceutical industry, BioHive-2 at the Salt Lake City headquarters of Recursion debuts today at No. 35, up more than 100 spots from its predecessor on the latest TOP500 list of the world’s fastest supercomputers.</p>
<p>The advance represents the company’s most recent effort to accelerate drug discovery with NVIDIA technologies.</p>
<p>“Just as with large language models, we see AI models in the biology domain improve performance substantially as we scale our training with more data and compute horsepower, which ultimately leads to greater impacts on patients’ lives,” said Recursion’s CTO, Ben Mabey, who’s been applying machine learning to healthcare for more than a decade.</p>
<p>BioHive-2 packs 504 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> linked on an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/">NVIDIA Quantum-2</a> InfiniBand network to deliver 2 exaflops of AI performance. The resulting <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD</a> is nearly 5x faster than Recursion’s first-generation system, BioHive-1.</p>
<h2><b>Performance Powers Through Complexity</b></h2>
<p>That performance is key to rapid progress because “biology is insanely complex,” Mabey said.</p>
<p>Finding a new drug candidate can take scientists years performing millions of wet-lab experiments.</p>
<p>That work is vital; Recursion’s scientists run more than 2 million such experiments a week. But going forward, they’ll use AI models on BioHive-2 to direct their platform to the most promising biology areas to run their experiments.</p>
<p>“With AI in the loop today, we can get 80% of the value with 40% of the wet lab work, and that ratio will improve going forward,” he said.</p>
<h2><b>Biological Data Propels Healthcare AI</b></h2>
<p>Recursion is collaborating with biopharma companies such as Bayer AG, Roche and Genentech. Over time, it also amassed a more than 50-petabyte database of biological, chemical and patient data, helping it build powerful AI models that are accelerating drug discovery.</p>
<p>“We believe it’s one of the largest biological datasets on Earth — it was built with AI training in mind, intentionally spanning biology and chemistry,” said Mabey, who joined the company more than seven years ago in part due to its commitment to building such a dataset.</p>
<h2><b>Creating an AI Phenomenon</b></h2>
<p>Processing that data on BioHive-1, Recursion developed a family of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/">foundation models</a> called Phenom. They turn a series of microscopic cellular images into meaningful representations for understanding the underlying biology.</p>
<p>A member of that family, <a href="https://www.recursion.com/news/nothing-short-of-phenomenal-new-deep-learning-model-available-on-nvidias-bionemo-platform">Phenom-Beta</a>, is now available as a cloud API and the first third-party model on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a>, a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> platform for drug discovery.</p>
<p>Over several months of research and iteration, BioHive-1 trained <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10242">Phenom-1</a> using more than 3.5 billion cellular images. Recursion’s expanded system enables training even more powerful models with larger datasets in less time.</p>
<p>The company also used <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a>, hosted by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, to provide additional supercomputing resources to power their work.</p>
<figure id="attachment_71588" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71588" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-71588" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation-672x338.gif" alt="Animation of how Recursion trains AI models for drug discovery on NVIDIA GPUs" width="672" height="338" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation-672x338.gif 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation-400x201.gif 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation-768x386.gif 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation-842x423.gif 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation-406x204.gif 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation-188x94.gif 188w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-71588" class="wp-caption-text">Much like how LLMs are trained to generate missing words in a sentence, Phenom models are trained by asking them to generate the masked out pixels in images of cells.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Phenom-1 model serves Recursion and its partners in several ways, including finding and optimizing molecules to treat a variety of diseases and cancers. Earlier models helped Recursion predict drug candidates for COVID-19 nine out of 10 times.</p>
<p>The company announced its <a href="https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-announces-collaboration-and-50-million-investment">collaboration with NVIDIA</a> in July. Less than 30 days later, the combination of BioHive-1 and DGX Cloud <a href="https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-bridges-protein-and-chemical-space-massive-protein">screened and analyzed</a> a massive chemical library to predict protein targets for approximately 36 billion chemical compounds.</p>
<p>In January, the company <a href="https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-unveils-lowe-drug-discovery-software-jp-morgan">demonstrated</a> LOWE, an AI workflow engine with a natural-language interface to help make its tools more accessible to scientists. And in April it <a href="https://portal.valencelabs.com/blogs/post/introducing-molgps---a-foundational-gnn-for-molecular-property-prediction-Ti4InC3788me9f5">described</a> a billion-parameter AI model it built to provide a new way to predict the properties of key molecules of interest in healthcare.</p>
<p>Recursion uses NVIDIA software to optimize its systems.</p>
<p>“We love CUDA and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a>, and we’re looking to see if <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> can help us distribute our models more easily, both internally and to partners,” he said.</p>
<h2><b>A Shared Vision for Healthcare</b></h2>
<p>The efforts are part of a broad vision that Jensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO, described in a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ceo-ai-drug-discovery-jp-morgan-healthcare-2024/">fireside chat</a> with Recursion’s chairman as moving toward simulating biology.</p>
<p>“You can now recognize and learn the language of almost anything with structure, and you can translate it to anything with structure … This is the generative AI revolution,” Huang said.</p>
<p>“We share a similar view,” said Mabey.</p>
<p>“We are in the early stages of a very interesting time where just as computers accelerated chip design, AI can speed up drug design. Biology is much more complex, so it will take years to play out, but looking back, people will see this was a real turning point in healthcare,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Quantum computing. Drug discovery. Fusion energy. Scientific computing and physics-based simulations are poised to make giant steps across domains that benefit humanity as advances in accelerated computing and AI drive the world’s next big breakthroughs.</p>
<p>NVIDIA unveiled at GTC in March <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing">the NVIDIA Blackwell platform</a>, which promises generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models (LLMs) at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than the NVIDIA Hopper architecture.</p>
<p>Blackwell has powerful implications for AI workloads, and its technology capabilities can also help to deliver discoveries across all types of scientific computing applications, including traditional numerical simulation.</p>
<p>By reducing energy costs, accelerated computing and AI drive <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/sustainable-computing/">sustainable computing</a>. Many scientific computing applications already benefit. Weather can be simulated at 200x lower cost and with 300x less energy, while digital twin simulations have 65x lower cost and 58x less energy consumption versus traditional CPU-based systems and others.</p>
<h2><b>Multiplying Scientific Computing Simulations With Blackwell</b></h2>
<p>Scientific computing and physics-based simulation often rely on what’s known as double-precision formats, or <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/double-precision-tensor-cores/">FP64 (floating point</a>), to solve problems. <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-blackwell-architecture">Blackwell GPUs</a> deliver 30% more FP64 and FP32 FMA (fused multiply-add) performance  than Hopper.</p>
<p>Physics-based simulations are critical to product design and development. From planes and trains to bridges, silicon chips and pharmaceuticals — testing and improving products in simulation saves researchers and developers billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Today application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are designed almost exclusively on CPUs in a long and complex workflow, including analog analysis to identify voltages and currents.</p>
<p>But that’s changing. The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/industrial-sector/cadence/">Cadence</a> SpectreX simulator is one example of an analog circuit design solver. SpectreX circuit simulations are projected to run 13x quicker on a GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip — which connects Blackwell GPUs and Grace CPUs — than on a traditional CPU.</p>
<p>Also, GPU-accelerated computational fluid dynamics, or CFD, has become a key tool. Engineers and equipment designers use it to predict the behavior of designs. Cadence Fidelity runs CFD simulations that are projected to run as much as 22x faster on GB200 systems than on traditional CPU-powered systems. With parallel scalability and 30TB of memory per GB200 NVL72 rack, it’s possible to capture flow details like never before.</p>
<p>In another application, Cadence Reality’s digital twin software can be used to create a virtual replica of a physical data center, including all its components — servers, cooling systems and power supplies. Such a virtual model allows engineers to test different configurations and scenarios before implementing them in the real world, saving time and costs.</p>
<p>Cadence Reality’s magic happens from physics-based algorithms that can simulate how heat, airflow and power usage affect data centers. This helps engineers and data center operators to more effectively manage capacity, predict potential operational problems and make informed decisions to optimize the layout and operation of the data center for improved efficiency and capacity utilization. With Blackwell GPUs, these simulations are projected to run up to 30x faster than with CPUs, offering accelerated timelines and higher energy efficiency.</p>

<h2><b>AI for Scientific Computing</b></h2>
<p>New Blackwell accelerators and networking will deliver leaps in performance for advanced simulation.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA GB200 kicks off a new era for high-performance computing (HPC). Its architecture sports a second-generation transformer engine optimized to accelerate inference workloads for LLMs.</p>
<p>This delivers a 30x speedup on resource-intensive applications like the 1.8-trillion-parameter GPT-MoE (generative pretrained transformer-mixture of experts) model compared to the H100 generation, unlocking new possibilities for HPC. By enabling LLMs to process and decipher vast amounts of scientific data, HPC applications can sooner reach valuable insights that can accelerate scientific discovery.</p>
<p>Sandia National Laboratories <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-science-isc/">is building</a> an LLM copilot for parallel programming. Traditional AI can generate basic serial computing code efficiently, but when it comes to parallel computing code for HPC applications, LLMs can falter. Sandia researchers are tackling this issue head-on with an ambitious project — automatically generating parallel code in Kokkos, a specialized programming language designed by multiple national labs for running tasks across tens of thousands of processors in the world’s most powerful supercomputers.</p>
<p>Sandia is using an AI technique known as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, or RAG, which combines information-retrieval capabilities with language generation models. The team is creating a Kokkos database and integrating it with AI models using RAG.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Generative AI is taking root at national and corporate labs, accelerating high-performance computing for business and science.</p>
<p>Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories aim to automatically <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/advanced-ai-and-retrieval-augmented-generation-for-code-development-in-high-performance-computing/">generate code in Kokkos</a>, a parallel programming language designed for use across many of the world’s largest supercomputers.</p>
<p>It’s an ambitious effort. The specialized language, developed by researchers from several national labs, handles the nuances of running tasks across tens of thousands of processors.</p>
<p>Sandia is employing retrieval-augmented generation (<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">RAG</a>) to create and link a Kokkos database with AI models. As researchers experiment with different RAG approaches, initial tests show promising results.</p>
<p>Cloud-based services like <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/translate-your-enterprise-data-into-actionable-insights-with-nvidia-nemo-retriever/">NeMo Retriever</a> are among the RAG options the scientists will evaluate.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA provides a rich set of tools to help us significantly accelerate the work of our HPC software developers,” said Robert Hoekstra, a senior manager of extreme scale computing at Sandia.</p>
<p>Building copilots via model tuning and RAG is just a start. Researchers eventually aim to employ foundation models trained with scientific data from fields such as climate, biology and material science.</p>
<h2><b>Getting Ahead of the Storm</b></h2>
<p>Researchers and companies in weather forecasting are embracing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15214">CorrDiff</a>, a generative AI model that’s part of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/high-performance-computing/earth-2/">NVIDIA Earth-2</a>, a set of services and software for weather and climate research.</p>
<p>CorrDiff can scale the 25km resolution of traditional atmosphere models down to 2 kilometers and expand by more than 100x the number of forecasts that can be combined to improve confidence in predictions.</p>
<p>“It’s a promising innovation … We plan to leverage such models in our global and regional AI forecasts for richer insights,” said Tom Gowan, machine learning and modeling lead for Spire, a company in Vienna, Va., that collects data from its own network of tiny satellites.</p>
<p>Generative AI enables faster, more accurate forecasts, he said in a recent <a href="https://spire.com/blog/weather-climate/ai-weather-modeling-spire-and-nvidia-partnership/">interview</a>.</p>
<p>“It really feels like a big jump in meteorology,” he added. “And by partnering with NVIDIA, we have access to the world’s best GPUs that are the most reliable, fastest and most efficient ones for both training and inference.”</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-71561" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast-672x410.jpg" alt="Graphic showing Spire weather forecast" width="672" height="410" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast-672x410.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast-400x244.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast-768x469.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast-737x450.jpg 737w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast-352x215.jpg 352w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast-164x100.jpg 164w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>Switzerland-based Meteomatics recently <a href="https://www.meteomatics.com/en/news/meteomatics-nvidia-ai-based-weather-forecasts/">announced</a> it also plans to use NVIDIA’s generative AI platform for its weather forecasting business.</p>
<p>“Our work with NVIDIA will help energy companies maximize their renewable energy operations and increase their profitability with quick and accurate insight into weather fluctuations,” said Martin Fengler, founder and CEO of Meteomatics.</p>
<h2><b>Generating Genes to Improve Healthcare</b></h2>
<p>At Argonne National Laboratory, scientists are using the technology to generate gene sequences that help them better understand the virus behind COVID-19. Their award-winning models, called GenSLMs, spawned simulations that closely resemble real-world variants of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>“Understanding how different parts of the genome are co-evolving gives us clues about how the virus may develop new vulnerabilities or new forms of resistance,” Arvind Ramanathan, a lead researcher, said in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-covid-genome-sequences/">a blog</a>.</p>
<p>GenSLMs were trained on more than 110 million genome sequences with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU</a>-powered supercomputers, including Argonne’s <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-turbocharges-extreme-scale-ai-for-argonne-national-laboratorys-polaris-supercomputer">Polaris</a> system, the U.S. Department of Energy’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nersc-perlmutter-ai-supercomputer/">Perlmutter</a> and NVIDIA’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/making-selene-pandemic-ai/">Selene</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Microsoft Proposes Novel Materials</b></h2>
<p>Microsoft Research showed how generative AI can accelerate work in materials science.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/mattergen-property-guided-materials-design/">MatterGen</a> model generates novel, stable materials that exhibit desired properties. The approach enables specifying chemical, magnetic, electronic, mechanical and other desired properties.</p>
<p>“We believe MatterGen is an important step forward in AI for materials design,” the Microsoft Research team wrote of the model they trained on Azure AI infrastructure with NVIDIA A100 GPUs.</p>
<p>Companies such as <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/using-graph-neural-networks-for-additive-manufacturing/">Carbon3D</a> are already finding opportunities, applying generative AI to materials science in commercial 3D printing operations.</p>
<p>It’s just the beginning of what researchers will be able to do for HPC and science with generative AI. The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h200/">NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs</a> available now and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/">NVIDIA Blackwell Architecture GPUs</a> will take their work to new levels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Data centers need an upgraded dashboard to guide their journey to greater <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/energy-efficiency/">energy efficiency</a>, one that shows progress running real-world applications.</p>
<p>The formula for energy efficiency is simple: work done divided by energy used. Applying it to data centers calls for unpacking some details.</p>
<p>Today’s most widely used gauge — power usage effectiveness (<a href="https://leonardo-energy.pl/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Green_Grid_Metrics.pdf">PUE</a>)  — compares the total energy a facility consumes to the amount its computing infrastructure uses. Over the last 17 years, PUE has driven the most efficient operators closer to an ideal where almost no energy is wasted on processes like power conversion and cooling.</p>
<h2><b>Finding the Next Metrics</b></h2>
<p>PUE served data centers well during the rise of cloud computing, and it will continue to be useful. But it’s insufficient in today’s <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> era, when workloads and the systems running them have changed dramatically.</p>
<p>That’s because PUE doesn’t measure the useful output of a data center, only the energy that it consumes. That’d be like measuring the amount of gas an engine uses without noticing how far the car has gone.</p>
<p>Many standards exist for data center efficiency. A<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7921551"> 2017 paper</a> lists nearly three dozen of them, several focused on specific targets such as cooling, water use, security and cost.</p>
<h2><b>Understanding What’s Watts</b></h2>
<p>When it comes to energy efficiency, the computer industry has a long and somewhat unfortunate history of describing systems and the processors they use in terms of power, typically in watts. It’s a worthwhile metric, but many fail to realize that watts only measure input power at a point in time, not the actual energy computers use or how efficiently they use it.</p>
<p>So, when modern systems and processors report rising input power levels in watts, that doesn’t mean they’re less energy efficient. In fact, they’re often much more efficient in the amount of work they do with the amount of energy they use.</p>
<p>Modern data center metrics should focus on energy, what the engineering community knows as kilowatt-hours or joules. The key is how much useful work they do with this energy.</p>
<h2><b>Reworking What We Call Work</b></h2>
<p>Here again, the industry has a practice of measuring in abstract terms, like processor instructions or math calculations. So, MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and FLOPS (floating point operations per second) are widely quoted.</p>
<p>Only computer scientists care how many of these low-level jobs their system can handle. Users would prefer to know how much real work their systems put out, but defining useful work is somewhat subjective.</p>
<p>Data centers focused on AI may rely on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/mlperf-benchmarks/">MLPerf benchmarks</a>. Supercomputing centers tackling scientific research typically use <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-application-performance">additional measures</a> of work. Commercial data centers focused on streaming media may want others.</p>
<p>The resulting suite of applications must be allowed to evolve over time to reflect the state of the art and the most relevant use cases. For example, the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tensorrt-llm-inference-mlperf/">last MLPerf round</a> added tests using two generative AI models that didn’t even exist five years ago.</p>
<h2><b>A Gauge for Accelerated Computing</b></h2>
<p>Ideally, any new benchmarks should measure advances in<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/"> accelerated computing</a>. This combination of parallel processing hardware, software and methods is running applications dramatically faster and more efficiently than CPUs across many modern workloads.</p>
<p>For example, on scientific applications, the Perlmutter supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gpu-energy-efficiency-nersc/">demonstrated</a> an average of 5x gains in energy efficiency using accelerated computing. That’s why it’s among the 39 of the top 50 supercomputers — including the No. 1 system — on<a href="https://www.top500.org/lists/green500/2023/11/"> the Green500 list</a> that use NVIDIA GPUs.</p>

<p>Companies across many industries share similar results. For example, PayPal improved real-time fraud detection by 10% and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/gpu-inference-momentum-continues-to-build/">lowered server energy consumption</a> nearly 8x with accelerated computing.</p>
<p>The gains are growing with each new generation of GPU hardware and software.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/HAI_AI-Index-Report_2023.pdf">recent report</a>, Stanford University’s Human-Centered AI group estimated GPU performance “has increased roughly 7,000 times” since 2003, and price per performance is “5,600 times greater.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_71558" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71558" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Graph-of-data-center-benchmarks-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-71558" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Graph-of-data-center-benchmarks-672x377.jpg" alt="Chart depicts relationships among various data center energy efficiency graphics" width="672" height="377" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Graph-of-data-center-benchmarks-672x377.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Graph-of-data-center-benchmarks-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Graph-of-data-center-benchmarks-768x431.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Graph-of-data-center-benchmarks-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Graph-of-data-center-benchmarks-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Graph-of-data-center-benchmarks-801x450.jpg 801w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Graph-of-data-center-benchmarks-383x215.jpg 383w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Graph-of-data-center-benchmarks-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Graph-of-data-center-benchmarks-1280x719.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-71558" class="wp-caption-text">Data centers need a suite of benchmarks to track energy efficiency across their major workloads.</figcaption></figure>
<h2><b>Two Experts Weigh In</b></h2>
<p>Experts see the need for a new energy-efficiency metric, too.</p>
<p>With today’s data centers achieving scores around 1.2 PUE, the metric “has run its course,” said Christian Belady, a data center engineer who had the original idea for PUE. “It improved data center efficiency when things were bad, but two decades later, they’re better, and we need to focus on other metrics more relevant to today’s problems.”</p>
<p>Looking forward, “the holy grail is a performance metric. You can’t compare different workloads directly, but if you segment by workloads, I think there is a better likelihood for success,” said Belady, who continues to work on initiatives driving data center sustainability.</p>
<p>Jonathan Koomey, a researcher and author on computer efficiency and sustainability, agreed.</p>
<p>“To make good decisions about efficiency, data center operators need a suite of benchmarks that measure the energy implications of today’s most widely used AI workloads,” said Koomey.</p>
<p>“Tokens per joule is a great example of what one element of such a suite might be,” Koomey added. “Companies will need to engage in open discussions, share information on the nuances of their own workloads and experiments, and agree to realistic test procedures to ensure these metrics accurately characterize energy use for hardware running real-world applications.”</p>
<p>“Finally, we need an open public forum to conduct this important work,” he said.</p>
<h2><b>It Takes a Village</b></h2>
<p>Thanks to metrics like PUE and rankings like the Green500, data centers and supercomputing centers have made enormous progress in energy efficiency.</p>
<p>More can and must be done to extend efficiency advances in the age of generative AI. Metrics of energy consumed doing useful work on today’s top applications can take supercomputing and data centers to a new level of energy efficiency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Now’s the time to hop aboard AI, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang declared Wednesday as ServiceNow unveiled a demo of futuristic AI avatars together with NVIDIA during a keynote at the Knowledge 24 conference in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&#8220;If something is moving a million times faster every 10 years, what should you do?” Huang asked, citing rapid advancements in AI capabilities. &#8220;The first thing you should do is instead of looking at the train, from the side is … get on the train, because on the train, it&#8217;s not moving that fast.”</p>
<p>The demo — built on NVIDIA NIM inference microservices and NVIDIA <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">Avatar Cloud Engine</a>, or ACE, speech and animation generative AI technologies, all available with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software — highlighted how AI advancements support cutting-edge digital avatar communications and have the potential to revolutionize customer service interactions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71521" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3.jpg" alt="" width="1115" height="500" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3.jpg 1115w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3-400x179.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3-672x301.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3-768x344.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3-842x378.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3-406x182.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/servicenow3-188x84.jpg 188w" sizes="(max-width: 1115px) 100vw, 1115px" /></p>
<p>The demo showed a customer who was struggling with a slow internet connection interacting with a digital avatar. The AI customer service avatar comes to the rescue &#8211;  swiftly diagnoses the problem, offers an option for a faster internet connection, confirms the customer’s credit card number and upgrades their internet connection immediately.</p>
<p>The futuristic demonstration took place in front of thousands of conference attendees who were eager to learn about the latest enterprise generative AI technology advancements, which promise to empower workers across the globe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve transitioned from instruction-driven computer coding, which very few people can do, to intention-driven computing, which is connecting with somebody through intention,&#8221; Huang said during an on-stage conversation at the conference with ServiceNow Chief Operating Officer Chirantan “CJ” Desai.</p>
<p>The moment is another compelling example of the ongoing collaboration between ServiceNow and NVIDIA to explore more engaging, personal service experiences across various functions, including IT services, human resources, customer support and more.</p>
<p>The demonstration builds upon the companies’ plan to collaborate on robust, generative AI capabilities within enterprise operations and incorporates NVIDIA <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">ACE</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> microservices.</p>
<p>These avatars are designed to add a human-like touch to digital interactions, improving customer experience by providing empathetic and efficient support.</p>
<p>These include NVIDIA Riva for automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech, NVIDIA Audio2Face for facial animation, and NVIDIA Omniverse Renderer for high-quality visual output.</p>
<p>ServiceNow and NVIDIA are further exploring the use of AI avatars to provide another communication option for users who prefer visual interactions.</p>

<p>Resolve includes a large variety of built-in tools. Some are corrective in nature, letting editors match colors from two sets of footage, reframe footage after the fact or remove objects that weren’t meant to be in a shot. Others give editors the power to manipulate footage and audio in new ways, including smooth slow-motion effects and footage upscaling.</p>
<p>In the past, many of these tools required significant time and effort from users to implement. Resolve now uses AI acceleration to speed up many of these workflows, leaving more time for users to focus on creativity rather than batch processing.</p>
<p>Even better, the entire app is optimized for <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt">NVIDIA TensorRT</a> deep learning inference software to get the best performance from GPU-reliant effects and other features, boosting performance by 2x.</p>
<h2><b>New in Resolve 19</b></h2>
<p>The newest release, <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/whatsnew">DaVinci Resolve 19</a>, adds two new AI features that make video editing more efficient: the IntelliTrack AI point tracker for object tracking, stabilization and audio panning, and UltraNR, which uses AI for spatial noise reduction.</p>
<p>IntelliTrack AI makes it easy to stabilize footage during the editing process. It can also be used in Resolve’s Fairlight tool to track on-screen subjects, and automatically generate audio panning within a scene by tracking people or objects as they move across 2D and 3D spaces. With AI audio panning to video, editors can quickly pan, or move audio across the stereo field, multiple actors in a scene, controlling their voice positions in the mix environment. All of this can be done by hand, but IntelliTrack’s AI acceleration speeds up the entire process.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How to use IntelliTrack Tracking in DaVinci Resolve 19" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rXsKkY_Mkb4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>UltraNR is an AI-accelerated denoise mode in Resolve’s spatial noise reduction palette. Editors can use it to dramatically reduce digital noise — undesired fluctuations of color or luminance that obscure detail — from a frame while maintaining image clarity. They can also combine the tool with temporal noise reduction for even more effective denoising in images with motion, where fluctuations can be more noticeable.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DAVINCI RESOLVE 19!! What&#039;s NEW?! You won&#039;t want to miss this!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8ENuSsScDA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Both IntelliTrack and UltraNR get a big boost when running on NVIDIA RTX PCs and workstations. TensorRT lets them run up to 3x faster on a GeForce GTX 4090 laptop vs. the Macbook Pro M3 Max.</p>
<p>In fact, all DaVinci Resolve AI effects are accelerated on RTX GPUs by NVIDIA TensorRT. The new Resolve update also includes GPU acceleration for Beauty, Edge Detect and Watercolor effects, doubling their performance on NVIDIA GPUs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>In support of President Biden’s executive order on AI, the U.S. government will use an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD to produce generative AI advances in climate science, healthcare and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The executive order, issued in October, is aimed at ensuring U.S. leadership in AI and managing its risks. MITRE, a nonprofit organization that operates federally funded research and development centers, is implementing a new <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD</a> system that will provide researchers and developers access to massive computing leaps.</p>
<p>The DGX SuperPOD will support MITRE’s Federal AI Sandbox, a platform to improve experimentation with next-generation, AI-enabled applications across federal government agencies.</p>
<p>“The recent executive order on AI encourages federal agencies to reduce barriers for AI adoptions, but agencies often lack the computing environment necessary for experimentation and prototyping,” said Charles Clancy, senior vice president and chief technology officer at MITRE. “Our new Federal AI Sandbox will help level the playing field, making the high-quality compute power needed to train and test custom AI solutions available to any agency.”</p>
<p>The Federal AI Sandbox will deliver federal agencies the computing gains needed to train large language models and other generative AI tools to develop cutting-edge applications.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD powering the sandbox is capable of an exaFLOP of AI performance to enable researchers and developers to train and deploy custom LLMs and other AI solutions at scale.</p>
<p>“MITRE’s purchase of a DGX SuperPOD will help turbocharge the U.S. federal government’s development of its AI initiatives,” said Anthony Robbins, vice president of public sector at NVIDIA. “AI has enormous potential to improve government services for citizens and solve big challenges, like transportation and cybersecurity.”</p>
<p>The supercomputing initiative comes as the White House <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/partnership-universities-teach-ai-skills/">recently unveiled plans</a>, which include NVIDIA, for a $110 million partnership to help universities teach AI skills.</p>
