										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA today was named the world’s most innovative company by <i>Fast Company</i> magazine.</p>
<p>The accolade comes on the heels of company founder and CEO Jensen Huang being inducted into the U.S. National Academy of Engineering.</p>
<p>A team of several dozen journalists at <i>Fast Company</i> — a business media brand launched in 1995 by two <i>Harvard Business Review</i> editors — ranked NVIDIA the leader in its <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/list">2024 list</a> of the world’s 50 most innovative companies.</p>
<h2><b>“Putting AI to Work”</b></h2>
<p>“Nvidia isn’t just in the business of providing ever-more-powerful computing hardware and letting everybody else figure out what to do with it,” <i>Fast Company</i> wrote in <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91033514/nvidia-most-innovative-companies-2024">an article</a> detailing its selection.</p>
<p>“Across an array of industries, the company’s technologies, platforms, and partnerships are doing much of the heavy lifting of putting AI to work,” citing advances in automotive, drug discovery, gaming and retail announced in one recent week.</p>
<p>The article noted the central role of the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/about-cuda">CUDA</a> compute platform. It also shared an eye-popping experience using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> to interact with a digital twin of a Nissan Z sport coupe.</p>
<h2><b>In a League With Giants</b></h2>
<p>“Even for AI’s titans, building on what Nvidia has created — the more ambitiously, the better — is often how progress happens,” the article concluded.</p>
<p>Last year, OpenAI led the list for ChatGPT, the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models">large language model</a> that started a groundswell in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>. In 2021, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech topped the ranking for rapidly developing a Covid vaccine.</p>
<p><i>Fast Company</i> bases its ranking on four criteria: innovation, impact, timeliness and relevance. Launched in 2008, the annual list recognizes organizations that have introduced groundbreaking products, fostered positive social impact and reshaped industries.</p>
<p>NVIDIA invented the GPU in 1999, redefining computer graphics and igniting the era of modern AI. NVIDIA is now driving the platform shift to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/">accelerated computing</a> and generative AI, transforming the world’s largest industries.</p>
<h2><b>Fueling an AI Revolution</b></h2>
<p>Last month, Huang was elected to the National Academy of Engineering (<a href="https://www.nae.edu/">NAE</a>) for contributions in “high-powered graphics processing units, fueling the artificial intelligence revolution.”</p>
<p>Academy membership honors those who have made outstanding contributions such as pioneering new fields of technology. Founded in 1964, the NAE provides a trusted source of engineering advice for creating a healthier, more secure and sustainable world.</p>
<p>“Jensen Huang’s induction into the National Academy of Engineering is a testament to his enduring contributions to our industry and world,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft.</p>
<p>“His visionary leadership has forever transformed computing, from the broad adoption of advanced 3D graphics to today’s GPUs — and, more importantly, has driven foundational innovations across every sector, from gaming and productivity, to digital biology and healthcare. All of us at Microsoft congratulate Jensen on this distinction, and we are honored to partner with him and the entire NVIDIA team on defining this new era of AI,” he added.</p>
<p>“Jensen’s election is incredibly well deserved,” said John Hennessy, president emeritus of Stanford University and an NAE member since 1992.</p>
<p>“His election recognizes both his transformative technical contributions, as well as his incredible leadership of NVIDIA for almost 30 years. I have seen many NAE nominations over the past 30 years, Jensen’s was one of the best!”</p>
<p>Morris Chang, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and an NAE member since 2002, added his congratulations.</p>
<p>“Jensen is one of the most visionary engineers and charismatic business leaders I have had the pleasure to work with in the last three decades,” he said.</p>
<p>Huang is also a recipient of the Semiconductor Industry Association’s highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award, as well as honorary doctorate degrees from Taiwan’s National Chiao Tung University, National Taiwan University and Oregon State University.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Generative AI promises to revolutionize every industry it touches — all that’s been needed is the technology to meet the challenge.</p>
<p>NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang on Monday introduced that technology — the company’s new Blackwell computing platform — as he outlined the major advances that increased computing power can deliver for everything from software to services, robotics to medical technology and more.</p>
<p>“Accelerated computing has reached the tipping point — general purpose computing has run out of steam,” Huang told more than 11,000 GTC attendees gathered in-person — and many tens of thousands more online — for his keynote address at Silicon Valley’s cavernous SAP Center arena.</p>
<p>“We need another way of doing computing — so that we can continue to scale so that we can continue to drive down the cost of computing, so that we can continue to consume more and more computing while being sustainable. Accelerated computing is a dramatic speedup over general-purpose computing, in every single industry.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70552" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1365" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-400x267.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-672x448.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-675x450.jpg 675w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-323x215.jpg 323w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-1280x853.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>
<p>Huang spoke in front of massive images on a 40-foot tall, 8K screen the size of a tennis court to a crowd packed with CEOs and developers, AI enthusiasts and entrepreneurs, who walked together 20 minutes to the arena from the San Jose Convention Center on a dazzling spring day.</p>
<p>Delivering a massive upgrade to the world’s AI infrastructure, Huang introduced the NVIDIA Blackwell platform to unleash real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models.</p>
<p>Huang presented NVIDIA NIM — a reference to NVIDIA inference microservices — a new way of packaging and delivering software that connects developers with hundreds of millions of GPUs to deploy custom AI of all kinds.</p>
<p>And bringing AI into the physical world, Huang introduced Omniverse Cloud APIs to deliver advanced simulation capabilities.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y2F8yisiS6E?si=b9Y8b7x-sTGY4n-J" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Huang punctuated these major announcements with powerful demos, partnerships with some of the world’s largest enterprises and more than a score of announcements detailing his vision.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/">GTC</a> — which in 15 years has grown from the confines of a local hotel ballroom to the world’s most important AI conference — is returning to a physical event for the first time in five years.</p>
<p>This year’s has over 900 sessions — including a panel discussion on transformers moderated by Huang with the eight pioneers who first developed the technology, more than 300 exhibits and 20-plus technical workshops.</p>
<p>It’s an event that’s at the intersection of AI and just about everything. In a stunning opening act to the keynote, Refik Anadol, the world&#8217;s leading AI artist, showed a massive real-time AI data sculpture with wave-like swirls in greens, blues, yellows and reds, crashing, twisting and unraveling across the screen.</p>
<p>As he kicked off his talk, Huang explained that the rise of multi-modal AI — able to process diverse data types handled by different models — gives AI greater adaptability and power. By increasing their parameters, these models can handle more complex analyses.</p>
<p>But this also means a significant rise in the need for computing power. And as these collaborative, multi-modal systems become more intricate — with as many as a trillion parameters — the demand for advanced computing infrastructure intensifies.</p>
<p>“We need even larger models,” Huang said. “We’re going to train it with multimodality data, not just text on the internet, we’re going to train it on texts and images, graphs and charts, and just as we learned watching TV, there’s going to be a whole bunch of watching video.”</p>
<h2>The Next Generation of Accelerated Computing</h2>
<p>In short, Huang said “we need bigger GPUs.” The Blackwell platform is built to meet this challenge. Huang pulled a Blackwell chip out of his pocket and held it up side-by-side with a Hopper chip, which it dwarfed.</p>
<p>Named for David Harold Blackwell — a University of California, Berkeley mathematician specializing in game theory and statistics, and the first Black scholar inducted into the National Academy of Sciences — the new architecture succeeds the NVIDIA Hopper architecture, launched two years ago.</p>
<p>Blackwell delivers 2.5x its predecessor’s performance in FP8 for training, per chip, and 5x with FP4 for inference. It features a fifth-generation NVLink interconnect that’s twice as fast as Hopper and scales up to 576 GPUs.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/">NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip</a> connects two Blackwell <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/b200/">NVIDIA B200 Tensor Core GPUs</a> to the NVIDIA Grace CPU over a 900GB/s ultra-low-power NVLink chip-to-chip interconnect.</p>
<p>Huang held up a board with the system. “This computer is the first of its kind where this much computing fits into this small of a space,” Huang said. “Since this is memory coherent, they feel like it’s one big happy family working on one application together.”</p>
<p>For the highest AI performance, GB200-powered systems can be connected with the NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand and Spectrum-X800 Ethernet platforms, also <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/networking-switches-gpu-computing-ai">announced today</a>, which deliver advanced networking at speeds up to 800Gb/s.</p>

<p>“The amount of energy we save, the amount of networking bandwidth we save, the amount of wasted time we save, will be tremendous,” Huang said. “The future is generative &#8230; which is why this is a brand new industry. The way we compute is fundamentally different. We created a processor for the generative AI era.”</p>
<p>To scale up Blackwell, NVIDIA built a new chip called NVLink Switch. Each can connect four NVLink interconnects at 1.8 terabytes per second and eliminate traffic by doing in-network reduction.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Switch and GB200 are key components of what Huang described as “one giant GPU,” the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-gb200-nvl72-delivers-trillion-parameter-llm-training-and-real-time-inference/">NVIDIA GB200 NVL72</a>, a multi-node, liquid-cooled, rack-scale system that harnesses Blackwell to offer supercharged compute for trillion-parameter models, with 720 petaflops of AI training performance and 1.4 exaflops of AI inference performance in a single rack.</p>
<p>“There are only a couple, maybe three exaflop machines on the planet as we speak,” Huang said of the machine, which packs 600,000 parts and weighs 3,000 pounds. “And so this is an exaflop AI system in one single rack. Well let’s take a look at the back of it.”</p>
<p>Going even bigger, NVIDIA today also announced its next-generation AI supercomputer — the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod-gb200/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD powered by NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips</a> — for processing trillion-parameter models with constant uptime for superscale generative AI training and inference workloads.</p>
<p>Featuring a new, highly efficient, liquid-cooled rack-scale architecture, the new DGX SuperPOD is built with NVIDIA DG GB200 systems and provides 11.5 exaflops of AI supercomputing at FP4 precision and 240 terabytes of fast memory — scaling to more with additional racks.</p>
<p>“In the future, data centers are going to be thought of &#8230; as AI factories,” Huang said. “Their goal in life is to generate revenues, in this case, intelligence.”</p>
<p>The industry has already embraced Blackwell.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing">press release announcing Blackwell</a> includes endorsements from Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Dell CEO Michael Dell, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, and Tesla and xAI CEO Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Blackwell is being adopted by every major global cloud services provider,  pioneering AI companies, system and server vendors, and regional cloud service providers and telcos all around the world.</p>
<p>“The whole industry is gearing up for Blackwell,” which Huang said would be the most successful launch in the company’s history.</p>
<h2>A New Way to Create Software</h2>
<p>Generative AI changes the way applications are written, Huang said.</p>
<p>Rather than writing software, he explained, companies will assemble AI models, give them missions, give examples of work products, review plans and intermediate results.</p>
<p>These packages — NVIDIA NIMs — are built from NVIDIA’s accelerated computing libraries and generative AI models, Huang explained.</p>
<p>“How do we build software in the future? It is unlikely that you’ll write it from scratch or write a whole bunch of Python code or anything like that,” Huang said. “It is very likely that you assemble a team of AIs.”</p>
<p>The microservices support industry-standard APIs so they are easy to connect, work across NVIDIA’s large CUDA installed base, are re-optimized for new GPUs, and are constantly scanned for security vulnerabilities and exposures.</p>
<p>Huang said customers can use NIM microservices off the shelf, or NVIDIA can help build proprietary AI and copilots, teaching a model specialized skills only a specific company would know to create invaluable new services.</p>
<p>“The enterprise IT industry is sitting on a goldmine,” Huang said. “They have all these amazing tools (and data) that have been created over the years. If they could take that goldmine and turn it into copilots, these copilots can help us do things.”</p>
<p>Major tech players are already putting it to work. Huang detailed how NVIDIA is already helping Cohesity, NetApp, SAP, ServiceNow and Snowflake build copilots and virtual assistants. And industries are stepping in, as well.</p>
<p>In telecom, Huang announced the NVIDIA 6G Research Cloud, a generative AI and Omniverse-powered platform to advance the next communications era. It’s built with NVIDIA’s Sionna neural radio framework, NVIDIA Aerial CUDA-accelerated radio access network and the NVIDIA Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin for 6G.</p>
<p>In semiconductor design and manufacturing, Huang announced that, in collaboration with TSMC and Synopsys, NVIDIA is bringing its breakthrough computational lithography platform, cuLitho, to production. This platform will accelerate the most compute-intensive workload in semiconductor manufacturing by 40-60x.</p>
<p>Huang also announced the NVIDIA Earth Climate Digital Twin. The cloud platform — available now — enables interactive, high-resolution simulation to accelerate climate and weather prediction.</p>
<p>The greatest impact of AI will be in healthcare, Huang said, explaining that NVIDIA is already in imaging systems, in gene sequencing instruments and working with leading surgical robotics companies.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is launching a new type of biology software. NVIDIA today launched more than <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/generative-ai-microservices-for-developers">two dozen new microservices</a> that allow healthcare enterprises worldwide to take advantage of the latest advances in generative AI from anywhere and on any cloud. They offer advanced imaging, natural language and speech recognition, and digital biology generation, prediction and simulation.</p>
<h2>Omniverse Brings AI to the Physical World</h2>
<p>The next wave of AI will be AI learning about the physical world, Huang said.</p>
<p>“We need a simulation engine that represents the world digitally for the robot so that the robot has a gym to go learn how to be a robot,” he said. “We call that virtual world Omniverse.”</p>
<p>That’s why NVIDIA today announced that <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud</a> will be available as APIs, extending the reach of the world’s leading platform for creating industrial digital twin applications and workflows across the entire ecosystem of software makers.</p>
<p>The five new Omniverse Cloud application programming interfaces enable developers to easily integrate core Omniverse technologies directly into existing design and automation software applications for digital twins, or their simulation workflows for testing and validating autonomous machines like robots or self-driving vehicles.</p>
<p>To show how this works, Huang shared a demo of a robotic warehouse — using multi-camera perception and tracking — watching over workers and orchestrating robotic forklifts, which are driving autonomously with the full robotic stack running.</p>
<p>Huang also announced that NVIDIA is bringing Omniverse to Apple Vision Pro, with the new Omniverse Cloud APIs letting developers stream interactive industrial digital twins into the VR headsets.</p>

<p>Some of the world’s largest industrial software makers are embracing Omniverse Cloud APIs, including Ansys, Cadence, Dassault Systèmes for its 3DEXCITE brand, Hexagon, Microsoft, Rockwell Automation, Siemens and Trimble.</p>
<h2>Robotics</h2>
<p>Everything that moves will be robotic, Huang said. The automotive industry will be a big part of that. NVIDIA computers are already in cars, trucks, delivery bots and robotaxis.</p>
<p>Huang announced that BYD, the world’s largest autonomous vehicle company, has selected NVIDIA’s next-generation computer for its AV, building its next-generation EV fleets on DRIVE Thor.</p>
<p>To help robots better see their environment, Huang also announced the Isaac Perceptor software development kit with state-of-the-art multi-camera visual odometry, 3D reconstruction and occupancy map, and depth perception.</p>
<p>And to help make manipulators, or robotic arms, more adaptable, NVIDIA is announcing Isaac Manipulator — a state-of-the-art robotic arm perception, path planning and kinematic control library.</p>
<p>Finally, Huang announced Project GR00T, a general-purpose foundation model for humanoid robots, designed to further the company’s work driving breakthroughs in robotics and embodied AI.</p>
<p>Supporting that effort, Huang unveiled a new computer, Jetson Thor, for humanoid robots based on the NVIDIA Thor system-on-a-chip and significant upgrades to the NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform.</p>
<p>In his closing minutes, Huang brought on stage a pair of diminutive NVIDIA-powered robots from Disney Research.</p>
<p>“The soul of NVIDIA — the intersection of computer graphics, physics, artificial intelligence,” he said. “It all came to bear at this moment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>With nearly two dozen world records to its name, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/cuopt/">NVIDIA cuOpt</a> now holds the top spot for 100% of the largest routing benchmarks in the last three years. And this means the route optimization engine allows industries to hop on board for all kinds of cost-saving efficiencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://global.kawasaki.com/">Kawasaki Heavy Industries</a> and SyncTwin are among the companies that are riding cuOpt for logistics improvements.</p>
<p>Today at GTC 2024, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced that cuOpt is moving into general availability.</p>
<p>“With cuOpt, NVIDIA is reinventing logistics management and operations research. It is NVIDIA’s pre-quantum computer, driving transformational operational efficiencies for deliveries, service calls, warehouses and factories, and supply chains,” he said.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA cuOpt microservice, part of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform, makes accelerated optimization for real-time dynamic rerouting, factory optimization and robotic simulations available to any organization.</p>
<p>Companies can embed cuOpt into the advanced 3D tools, applications and USD-based workflows they develop with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a software platform for developing and deploying advanced 3D applications and pipelines based on OpenUSD.</p>
<p>Implemented together, cuOpt, Omniverse and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/metropolis-for-factories">NVIDIA Metropolis for Factories</a> can help optimize and create safe environments in logistics-heavy facilities that rely on complex automation, precise material flow and human-robot interaction, such as automotive factories, semiconductor fabs and warehouses.</p>
<p>cuOpt has been continuously tested against the best-known solutions on the most studied benchmarks for route optimization, with results up to 100x faster than CPU-based implementations. With 15 records from the Gehring &amp; Homberger vehicle routing benchmark and eight from the Li &amp; Lim pickup and delivery benchmark, cuOpt has demonstrated the world’s best accuracy with the fastest times.</p>
<p>AI promises to deliver logistics efficiencies spanning from transportation networks to manufacturing and much more.</p>
<h2><b>Delivering Cost-Savings for Inspections With cuOpt</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://global.kawasaki.com/">Kawasaki Heavy Industries</a> is a manufacturing company that&#8217;s been building large machinery for more than a hundred years. The Japanese company partnered with Slalom and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/case-studies/reinventing-maintenance-operations-with-ai/">used cuOpt to create routing efficiencies</a> for the development of its AI-driven <a href="https://global.kawasaki.com/">Kawasaki Track Maintenance Platform</a>.</p>
<p>Railroad track maintenance is getting an <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/autonomous-trains-deep-learning-dgx-drive/">AI makeover worldwide</a>. Traditionally, track inspections and maintenance are time-consuming and difficult to manage to keep trains running on time. But track maintenance is critical for safety and transportation service. Railway companies are automating track inspections with AI and machine learning paired with digital cameras, lasers and gyrometric sensors.</p>
<p><a href="https://global.kawasaki.com/">Kawasaki</a> is harnessing the edge computing of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin</a> to develop track inspections on its Track Maintenance Platform for running onboard trains. The platform enables customers to improve vision models with the data collected on tracks for advances in the inspection capability of the edge-based AI system.</p>
<p>The platform provides maintenance teams data on track conditions that allows them to prioritize repairs, creating increased safety and reliability of operations.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://global.kawasaki.com/">Kawasaki</a>, it’s estimated that such an AI-driven system can save $218 million a year for seven companies from automating their track inspections.</p>
<h2><b>Creating Manufacturing Efficiencies With cuOpt and Omniverse</b></h2>
<p>A worldwide leader in automotive seating manufacturing has adopted SyncTwin’s digital twin capability, which is driven by Omniverse and cuOpt, to improve its operations with AI.</p>
<p>The global automotive seating manufacturer has a vast network of loading docks for the delivery of raw materials, and forklifts for unloading and transporting them to storage and handling areas to ensure a steady supply to production lines. SyncTwin’s connection to cuOpt delivers routing efficiencies that optimize all of these moving parts — from vehicles to robotic pallet jacks.</p>
<p>As the SyncTwin solution was developed on top of Omniverse and USD, manufacturers can ensure that their various factory planning tools can contribute to the creation of a rich <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-twin/">digital twin</a> environment. Plus, they eliminate tedious manual data collection and gain new insights from their previously disconnected data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Cars of the future will be more than just modes of transportation; they’ll be intelligent companions, seamlessly blending technology and comfort to enhance driving experiences, and built for safety, inside and out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/">NVIDIA GTC</a>, running this week at the San Jose Convention Center, will spotlight the groundbreaking work NVIDIA and its partners are doing to bring the transformative power of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20enables%20users%20to,or%20other%20types%20of%20data.">generative AI</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language models</a> and visual language models to the mobility sector.</p>
<p>At its booth, NVIDIA will showcase how it’s building automotive assistants to enhance driver safety, security and comfort through enhanced perception, understanding and generative capabilities powered by deep learning and transformer models.</p>
<h2><b>Talking the Talk</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/large-language-models/">LLMs</a>, a form of generative AI, largely represent a class of deep-learning architectures known as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-transformer-model/">transformer models</a>, which are neural networks adept at learning context and meaning.</p>
<p>Vision language models are another derivative of generative AI, that offer image processing and language understanding capabilities. Unlike traditional or multimodal LLMs that primarily process and generate text-based data, VLMs can analyze and generate text via images or videos.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generations</a> allows manufacturers to access knowledge from a specific database or the web to assist drivers.</p>
<p>These technologies together enable <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine</a>, or ACE, and multimodal language models to work together with the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/drive">NVIDIA DRIVE</a> platform to let automotive manufacturers develop their own intelligent in-car assistants.</p>
<p>For example, an Avatar configurator can allow designers to build unique, brand-inspired personas for their cars, complete with customized voices and emotional attributes. These AI-animated avatars can engage in natural dialogue, providing real-time assistance, recommendations and personalized interactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, AI-enhanced surround visualization enhances vehicle safety using 360-degree camera reconstruction, while the intelligent assistant sources external information, such as local driving laws, to inform decision-making.</p>
<p>Personalization is paramount, with AI assistants learning driver and passenger habits and adapting its behavior to suit occupants’ needs.</p>
<h2><b>Generative AI for Automotive in Full Force at GTC </b></h2>
<p>Several NVIDIA partners at GTC are also showcasing their latest generative AI developments using NVIDIA’s edge-to-cloud technology:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cerence’s</b> CaLLM is an automotive-specific LLM that serves as the foundation for the company’s next-gen in-car computing platform, running on NVIDIA DRIVE. The platform, unveiled late last year, is the future of in-car interaction, with an automotive- and mobility-specific assistant that provides an integrated in-cabin experience. Cerence is collaborating with NVIDIA engineering teams for deeper integration of CaLLM with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/">NVIDIA AI Foundation Models</a>. Through joint efforts, Cerence is harnessing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a> as the development platform, applying guardrails for enhanced performance, and leveraging <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> to optimize inference. NVIDIA and Cerence will continue to partner and pioneer this solution together with several automotive OEMs this year.</li>
<li><b>Wavye</b> is helping usher in the new era of Embodied AI for autonomy, their next-generation AV2.0 approach is characterized by a large Embodied AI foundation model that learns to drive self-supervised using AI end-to-end —from sensing, as an input, to outputting driving actions. The British startup has already unveiled its GAIA-1, a generative world model for AV development running on NVIDIA; alongside LINGO-1, a closed-loop driving commentator that uses natural language to enhance the learning and explainability of AI driving models.</li>
<li><b>Li Auto</b> unveiled its multimodal cognitive model, Mind GPT, in June. Built on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a>, an open-source library, it serves as the basis for the electric vehicle maker’s AI assistant, Lixiang Tongxue, for scene understanding, generation, knowledge retention and reasoning capabilities. Li Auto is currently developing DriveVLM to enhance autonomous driving capabilities, enabling the system to understand complex scenarios, particularly those that are challenging for traditional AV pipelines, such as unstructured roads, rare and unusual objects, and unexpected traffic events. This advanced model is trained on the NVIDIA GPUs and utilizes TensorRT-LLM and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/triton-inference-server">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a> for data generation in the data center. With inference optimized by NVIDIA DRIVE and TensorRT-LLM, DriveVLMs perform efficiently on embedded systems.</li>
<li><b>NIO</b> launched its NOMI GPT, which offers a number of functional experiences, including NOMI Encyclopedia Q&amp;A, Cabin Atmosphere Master and Vehicle Assistant. With the capabilities enabled by LLMs and an efficient computing platform powered by NVIDIA AI stacks, NOMI GPT is capable of basic speech recognition and command execution functions and can use deep learning to understand and process more complex sentences and instructions inside the car.</li>
<li><b>Geely</b> is working with NVIDIA to provide intelligent cabin experiences, along with accelerated edge-to-cloud deployment. Specifically, Geely is applying generative AI and LLM technology to provide smarter, personalized and safer driving experiences, using natural language processing, dialogue systems and predictive analytics for intelligent navigation and voice assistants. When deploying LLMs into production, Geely uses NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM to achieve highly efficient inference. For more complex tasks or scenarios requiring massive data support, Geely plans to deploy large-scale models in the cloud.</li>
<li><b>Waabi</b> is building AI for self-driving and will use the generative AI capabilities afforded by NVIDIA DRIVE Thor for its breakthrough autonomous trucking solutions, bringing safe and reliable autonomy to the trucking industry.</li>
<li><b>Lenovo</b> is unveiling a new AI acceleration engine, dubbed UltraBoost, which will run on NVIDIA DRIVE, and features an AI model engine and AI compiler tool chains to facilitate the deployment of LLMs within vehicles.</li>
<li><b>SoundHound AI</b> is using NVIDIA to run its in-vehicle voice interface — which combines both real-time and generative AI capabilities — even when a vehicle has no cloud connectivity. This solution also offers drivers access to SoundHound’s Vehicle Intelligence product, which instantly delivers settings, troubleshooting and other information directly from the car manual and other data sources via natural speech, as opposed to through a physical document.</li>
<li><b>Tata Consultancy Services</b> (part of the TATA Group), through its AI-based technology and engineering innovation, has built its automotive GenAI suite powered by NVIDIA GPUs and software frameworks. It accelerates the design, development, and validation of software-defined vehicles, leveraging the various LLMs and VLMs for in-vehicle and cloud-based systems.</li>
<li><b>MediaTek</b> is announcing four automotive systems-on-a-chip within its Dimensity Auto Cockpit portfolio, offering powerful AI-based in-cabin experiences for the next generation of intelligent vehicles that span from premium to entry level. To support deep learning capabilities, the Dimensity Auto Cockpit chipsets integrate NVIDIA’s next-gen GPU-accelerated AI computing and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a>-powered graphics to run LLMs in the car, allowing vehicles to support chatbots, rich content delivery to multiple displays, driver alertness detection and other AI-based safety and entertainment applications.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Designing, simulating and bringing up modern data centers is incredibly complex, involving multiple considerations like performance, energy efficiency and scalability.</p>
<p>It also requires bringing together a team of highly skilled engineers across compute and network design, computer-aided design (CAD) modeling, and mechanical, electrical and thermal design.</p>
<p>NVIDIA builds the world’s most advanced AI supercomputers and at GTC unveiled its latest — a large cluster based on the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 liquid-cooled system. It consists of two racks, each containing 18 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-cpu/">NVIDIA Grace CPUs</a> and 36 <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing">NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs</a>, connected by fourth-generation <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/">NVIDIA NVLink</a> switches.</p>
<p>On the show floor, NVIDIA demoed this fully operational data center as a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-twin/">digital twin</a> in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform for connecting and building generative AI-enabled 3D pipelines, tools, applications and services.</p>
<p>To bring up new data centers as fast as possible, NVIDIA first built its digital twin with software tools connected by Omniverse. Engineers unified and visualized multiple CAD datasets in full physical accuracy and photorealism in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description</a> (OpenUSD) using the <a href="https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cadence</a> Reality digital twin platform, powered by NVIDIA Omniverse APIs.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Accelerating Data Center Design With Digital Twins" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h68kXLIRilM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Design, Simulate and Optimize With Enhanced Efficiency and Accuracy</b></h2>
<p>The new GB200 cluster is replacing an existing cluster in one of NVIDIA’s legacy data centers. To start the digital build-out, technology company <a href="https://kinetic-vision.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinetic Vision</a> scanned the facility using the <a href="https://www.navvis.com/vlx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NavVis VLX wearable lidar scanner</a> to produce highly accurate point cloud data and panorama photos.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="https://www.prevu3d.com/solutions/realitymesh-omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prevu3D</a> software was used to remove the existing clusters and convert the point cloud to a 3D mesh. This provided a physically accurate 3D model of the facility, in which the new digital data center could be simulated.</p>
<p>Engineers combined and visualized multiple CAD datasets with enhanced precision and realism by using the Cadence Reality platform. The platform’s integration with Omniverse provided a powerful computing platform that enabled teams to develop OpenUSD-based 3D tools, workflows and applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/omniverse-cloud-apis-industrial-digital-twin">Omniverse Cloud APIs</a> also added interoperability with more tools, including PATCH MANAGER and NVIDIA Air. With PATCH MANAGER, the team designed the physical layout of their cluster and networking infrastructure, ensuring that cabling lengths were accurate and routing was properly configured.</p>
<p>The team used Cadence’s Reality Digital Twin solvers, accelerated by <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus">NVIDIA Modulus</a> APIs and NVIDIA Grace Hopper, to simulate airflows, as well as the performance of the new liquid-cooling systems from partners like Vertiv and Schneider Electric. The integrated cooling systems in the GB200 trays were simulated and optimized using solutions from Ansys, which brought simulation data into the digital twin.</p>
<p>The demo showed how digital twins can allow users to fully test, optimize and validate data center designs before ever producing a physical system. By visualizing the performance of the data center in the digital twin, teams can better optimize their designs and plan for what-if scenarios.</p>
<p>Users can also enhance data center and cluster designs by balancing disparate sets of boundary conditions, such as cabling lengths, power, cooling and space, in an integrated manner — enabling engineers and design teams to bring clusters online much faster and with more efficiency and optimization than before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>A sharp increase in generative AI deployments is driving business innovation for enterprises across industries. But it’s also posing significant challenges for their IT teams, as slowdowns from long and complex infrastructure deployment cycles prevent them from quickly spinning up AI workloads using their own data.</p>
<p>To help overcome these barriers, NVIDIA has introduced a storage partner validation program for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/platform/ovx/">NVIDIA OVX computing systems</a>. The high-performance storage systems leading the way in completing the NVIDIA OVX storage validation are DDN, Dell PowerScale, NetApp, <a href="https://www.purestorage.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/pure-and-nvidia-accelerate-enterprise-ai-adoption-to-meet-growing-demands.html">Pure Storage</a> and WEKA.</p>
<p>NVIDIA OVX servers combine high-performance, GPU-accelerated compute with high-speed storage access and low-latency networking to address a range of complex AI and graphics-intensive workloads. Chatbots, summarization and search tools, for example, require large amounts of data, and high-performance storage is critical to maximize system throughput.</p>
<p>To help enterprises pair the right storage with NVIDIA-Certified OVX servers, the new program provides a standardized process for partners to validate their storage appliances. They can use the same framework and testing that’s needed to validate storage for the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/data-center/dgx-basepod/">NVIDIA DGX BasePOD</a> reference architecture.</p>
<p>To achieve validation, partners must complete a suite of NVIDIA tests measuring storage performance and input/out scaling across multiple parameters that represent the demanding requirements of various enterprise AI workloads. This includes combinations of different I/O sizes, varying numbers of threads, buffered I/O vs. direct I/O, random reads, re-reads and more.</p>
<p>Each test is run multiple times to verify the results and gather the required data, which is then audited by NVIDIA engineering teams to determine whether the storage system has passed.</p>
<p>The program offers prescriptive guidance to ensure optimal storage performance and scalability for enterprise AI workloads with NVIDIA OVX systems. But the overall design remains flexible, so customers can tailor their system and storage choices to fit their existing data center environments and bring accelerated computing to wherever their data resides.</p>
<p>Generative AI use cases have fundamentally different requirements than traditional enterprise applications, so IT teams must carefully consider their compute, networking, storage and software choices to ensure high performance and scalability.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/certified-systems/">NVIDIA-Certified Systems</a> are tested and validated to provide enterprise-grade performance, manageability, security and scalability for AI workloads. Their flexible reference architectures help deliver faster, more efficient and more cost-effective deployments than independently building from the ground up.</p>
<p>Powered by<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/l40s/"> NVIDIA L40S GPUs</a>, OVX servers include<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/"> NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/">NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand</a> or<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/spectrumx/"> NVIDIA Spectrum-X</a> Ethernet networking, as well as<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/data-processing-unit/"> NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs</a>. They’re optimized for generative AI workloads, including training for smaller LLMs (for example, Llama 2 7B or 70B), fine-tuning existing models and inference with high throughput and low latency.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/certification-programs/nvidia-certified-systems/index.html#nvidia-certified-systems-ovx-list">NVIDIA-Certified OVX servers</a> are now available and shipping from global system vendors, including GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-unveils-hybrid-ai-solutions-delivering-power-of-generative-ai-to-enterprises-with-nvidia">Lenovo</a>. Comprehensive, enterprise-grade support for these servers is provided by each system builder, in collaboration with NVIDIA.</p>
<h2><b>Availability </b></h2>
<p>Validated storage solutions for NVIDIA-Certified OVX servers are now available, and reference architectures will be published over the coming weeks by each of the storage and system vendors.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The latest advances in quantum computing include investigating molecules, deploying giant supercomputers and building the quantum workforce with a new academic program.</p>
<p>Researchers in Canada and the U.S. used a large language model to simplify quantum simulations that help scientists explore molecules.</p>
<p>“This new quantum algorithm opens the avenue to a new way of combining quantum algorithms with machine learning,” said Alan Aspuru-Guzik, a professor of chemistry and computer science at the University of Toronto, who led the team.</p>
<p>The effort used <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-q">CUDA-Q</a>, a hybrid programming model for GPUs, CPUs and the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-qpu/">QPUs</a> quantum systems use. The team ran its research on <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/eos/">Eos</a>, NVIDIA’s H100 GPU supercomputer.</p>
<p>Software from the effort will be made available for researchers in fields like healthcare and chemistry. Aspuru-Guzik will detail the work in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/session-catalog/?search=quantum&amp;tab.allsessions=1700692987788001F1cG&amp;search=quantum#/session/1696280074506001Ts8y">a talk</a> at GTC.</p>
<h2><b>Quantum Scales for Fraud Detection</b></h2>
<p>At HSBC, one of the world’s largest banks, researchers designed a quantum machine learning application that can detect fraud in digital payments.</p>
<p>The bank’s quantum machine learning algorithm simulated a whopping 165 qubits on NVIDIA GPUs. Research papers typically don’t extend beyond 40 of these fundamental calculating units quantum systems use.</p>
<p>HSBC used machine learning techniques implemented with CUDA-Q and<a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/latest/cutensornet/index.html"> cuTensorNet</a> software on NVIDIA GPUs to overcome challenges simulating quantum circuits at scale. Mekena Metcalf, a quantum computing research scientist at HSBC (pictured above), will present her work in a<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/session-catalog/?tab.allsessions=1700692987788001F1cG&amp;search=quantum#/session/1693079968998001x10J"> session at GTC</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Raising a Quantum Generation</b></h2>
<p>In education, NVIDIA is working with nearly two dozen universities to prepare the next generation of computer scientists for the quantum era. The collaboration will design curricula and teaching materials around CUDA-Q.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bridging the divide between traditional computers and quantum systems is essential to the future of computing,&#8221; said Theresa Mayer, vice president for research at Carnegie Mellon University. &#8220;NVIDIA is partnering with institutions of higher education, Carnegie Mellon included, to help students and researchers navigate and excel in this emerging hybrid environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>To help working developers get hands-on with the latest tools, NVIDIA co-sponsored QHack, a quantum hackathon in February.

<p>At GTC, HP and Shutterstock are showcasing a collaboration to enhance custom 3D printing using Edify 3D, providing designers with limitless prototype options.</p>
<p>Shutterstock’s 3D AI generator enables designers to rapidly iterate on concepts, creating digital assets that HP can convert to 3D printable models through automated workflows. HP 3D printers will then turn these models into physical prototypes to help inspire product designs.</p>
<p>Mattel is enabling 3D generative AI capabilities from Shutterstock that can accelerate the design ideation process. With AI tools, toy designers can visualize their ideas for new products with simple text descriptions. By lowering the technical barrier to creating high-fidelity concept design, designers can explore a broader pool of their ideas and iterate faster.</p>
<p>Shutterstock is also building Edify-based tools to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/shutterstock-generative-ai-picasso-360-hdri/">light 3D scenes</a> using 360 HDRi environments generated from text or image prompts.</p>
<p>Dassault Systèmes, through its leading 3DEXCITE applications for 3D content creation, and CGI studio Katana are incorporating Shutterstock generative 360 HDRi APIs into their workflows based on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a computing platform for developing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)</a>-based 3D workflows and applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2024/accenture-teams-with-nvidia-to-showcase-ai-powered-immersive-client-experiences-for-defender" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accenture Song</a>, the world’s largest tech-powered creative group, is using the Omniverse platform to generate high-fidelity Defender vehicles from computer-aided design data for marketing purposes. Coupled with generative AI microservices powered by Edify, Accenture Song is enabling the creation of cinematic, interactive 3D environments via conversational prompts. The result is a fully immersive 3D scene that harmonizes realistic generated environments with a digital twin of the Defender vehicle.</p>
<h2><b>Take Control: Turn Creative Vision Into Reality With Custom Fine-Tuning From Getty Images</b></h2>
<p>Getty Images continues to expand the capabilities offered through its commercially safe generative AI service, which provides users indemnification for the content they generate.</p>
<p>At January’s CES show, Getty Images released <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-picasso-istock-generative-ai/">Edify-powered APIs for inpainting</a>, to add, remove or replace objects in an image, and outpainting, to expand the creative canvas. Those features are now available on both Gettyimages.com and iStock.com.</p>
<p>Starting in May, Getty Images will also offer services to custom fine-tune the Edify foundation model to a company’s brand and visual style.</p>
<p>The services will feature a no-code, self-service method for companies to upload a proprietary dataset, review automatically generated tags, submit fine-tuning tasks and review the results before deploying to production.</p>
<p>As part of custom fine-tuning tools, Getty Images will release a collection of APIs that provide finer control over image output, one of the biggest challenges in generative AI.</p>
<p>Developers will soon be able to access Sketch, Depth and Segmentation features — which allow users to provide a sketch to guide the AI’s image generation; copy the composition of a reference image via depth map; and segment parts of an image to add, remove or retouch a character or object.</p>
<p>Getty Images’ API services are already being used by leading creatives and advertisers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dentsu Inc.</b>: The Japan-based ad agency is using Getty Images’ generative AI API service to power MAFA: Manga Anime For All, an app that can create manga and anime-style content for marketing use cases.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The journey to the future of secure communications is about to jump to warp drive.</p>
<p>NVIDIA cuPQC brings accelerated computing to developers working on cryptography for the age of quantum computing. The cuPQC library harnesses the parallelism of GPUs for their most demanding security algorithms.</p>
<h2><b>Refactoring Security for the Quantum Era  </b></h2>
<p>Researchers have known for years that quantum computers will be able to break the public keys used today to secure communications. As these systems approach readiness, government and industry initiatives have been ramping up to address this vital issue.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, for example, is expected to introduce the first standard algorithms for post-quantum cryptography as early as this year.</p>
<p>Cryptographers working on advanced algorithms to replace today’s public keys need powerful systems to design and test their work.</p>
<h2><b>Hopper Delivers up to 500x Speedups With cuPQC</b></h2>
<p>In its first benchmarks, cuPQC accelerated Kyber — an algorithm proposed as a standard for securing quantum-resistant keys — by up to 500x running on an <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-tensor-core">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU</a> compared with a CPU.</p>
<p>The speedups will be even greater with <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing">NVIDIA Blackwell architecture GPUs</a>, given Blackwell’s enhancements for the integer math used in cryptography and other high performance computing workloads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Securing data against quantum threats is a critically important problem, and we&#8217;re excited to work with NVIDIA to optimize post-quantum cryptography,&#8221; said Douglas Stebila, co-founder of the Open Quantum Safe project, a group spearheading work in the emerging field.</p>
<h2><b>Accelerating Community Efforts</b></h2>
<p>The project is a part of the newly formed Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance, hosted by the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p>The alliance funds open source projects to develop post-quantum libraries and applications. NVIDIA is a member of the alliance with seats on both its steering and technical committees.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is also collaborating with cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure on testing cuPQC.</p>
<p>In addition, leading companies in post-quantum cryptography such as evolutionQ, PQShield, QuSecure and SandboxAQ are collaborating with NVIDIA, many with plans to integrate cuPQC into their offerings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Different use cases will require a range of approaches for optimal acceleration,” said Ben Packman, a senior vice president at PQShield. &#8220;We are delighted to explore cuPQC with NVIDIA.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>AI — already used to connect, analyze and offer predictions based on operating room data — will be critical to the future of surgery, boosting operating room efficiency and clinical decision-making.</p>
<p>That’s why NVIDIA is working with <a href="https://www.jnjmedtech.com/en-US/news-events/johnson-johnson-medtech-working-nvidia-scale-ai-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson &amp; Johnson MedTech</a> to test new AI capabilities for the company’s connected digital ecosystem for surgery. It aims to enable open innovation and accelerate the delivery of real-time insights at scale to support medical professionals before, during and after procedures.</p>
<p>J&amp;J MedTech is in 80% of the world’s operating rooms and <a href="https://jnjinstitute.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trains more than 140,000 healthcare professionals</a> each year through its education programs.</p>
<p>Seeking to bring together its legacy and digital ecosystem in surgery with NVIDIA’s leading AI solutions — including the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/edge-computing/products/igx/">NVIDIA IGX</a> edge computing platform and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/holoscan/">NVIDIA Holoscan</a> edge AI platform for building medical devices — J&amp;J MedTech can accelerate the infrastructure needed to deploy AI-powered software applications for surgery. IGX and Holoscan can support secure, real-time processing from devices across the operating room to provide clinical insights and improve surgical outcomes.</p>
<p>Unveiled at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/">NVIDIA GTC</a>, the global AI conference taking place March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online, this work could also facilitate the deployment of third-party models and applications developed across the digital surgery ecosystem by providing a common AI compute platform.</p>
<p>“AI models are currently being created by experts in surgery in various parts of the world,” said Shan Jegatheeswaran, vice president and global head of digital at J&amp;J MedTech. “If we can create a trusted, open ecosystem that enables and accelerates coordination, it would create a flywheel of innovation where different groups can collaborate and connect at scale, improving access to advanced analytics across the surgical experience.”</p>
<h2><b>An Open Ecosystem for AI Innovation: Building on NVIDIA Holoscan and IGX </b></h2>
<p>J&amp;J MedTech is working with NVIDIA to test how industrial-grade edge AI capabilities purpose-built for medical environments could benefit surgery.</p>
<p>“Our connected digital ecosystem will help break down the traditional barriers to entry for developers seeking to build applications and deploy analytics in the operating room,” Jegatheeswaran said. “We’re making it simpler for those who want to participate in the surgical workflow by eliminating the heavy lifting of building a secure, enterprise-grade platform.”</p>
<p>NVIDIA Holoscan accelerates the development and deployment of real-time AI applications to process data streams.</p>
<p>Holoscan includes reference pipelines to build AI applications for a variety of medical use cases, including endoscopy, ultrasound and other sensors. It runs on NVIDIA IGX, which includes <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson Orin</a> modules, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a6000/">NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/ethernet-adapters/">NVIDIA ConnectX</a> networking technology to enable high-speed data streaming from medical devices or operating room video feeds.</p>
<p>NVIDIA supports the IGX software stack with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a>, the enterprise operating system for production-grade AI.</p>
<h2><b>Fueling Surgical AI With Device Data</b></h2>
<p>The J&amp;J MedTech team envisions the potential of NVIDIA-accelerated edge analytics behind its connected digital ecosystem as an enabler of AI-powered applications fueled by device, patient and other surgical data.</p>
<p>Developers could leverage continuous learning, where an algorithm improves based on data collected by the deployed device. Real-world footage collected by an endoscope, for example, could be used to refine an AI model that identifies organs, tissue and potential tumors in real time on an operating room display to support clinical decision-making.</p>
<p>“Surgical technologies will get more intelligent over time, bringing the power of advanced analytics to surgeons and hospitals,” said Jegatheeswaran. “A collection of AI models could act like driver-assistance technology for surgeons, amplifying their ability to deliver care while reducing cognitive load.”</p>
<p>One example is AI that removes personally identifiable information from surgical videos so they can be used downstream for research purposes — or, when processed in real time, enable hospitals to bring in external experts through telepresence to consult during a surgery while maintaining patient privacy.</p>
<p>Future applications could enable surgeons to interact with chatbots to gain insights about a patient’s medical history or best practices for handling certain complications. Other models could improve operating room efficiency by using video feeds to understand when a procedure is almost complete, alerting the next surgical team that a room will soon be available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Moving fast to accelerate its AI journey, <a href="https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en.html">BNY Mellon</a>, a global financial services company celebrating its 240th anniversary, revealed Monday that it has become the first major bank to deploy an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD</a> with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-h100">DGX H100 systems</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the strong collaborative relationship between <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/professional-services/">NVIDIA Professional Services</a> and BNY Mellon, the team was able to install and configure the DGX SuperPOD ahead of typical timelines.</p>
<p>The system, equipped with dozens of NVIDIA DGX systems and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/infiniband/">NVIDIA InfiniBand</a> networking and based on the DGX SuperPOD reference architecture, delivers computer processing performance that hasn’t been seen before at BNY Mellon.</p>
<p>“Key to our technology strategy is empowering our clients through scalable, trusted platforms and solutions,” said BNY Mellon Chief Information Officer <a href="https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/about-us/leadership/engle.html">Bridget Engle</a>. “By deploying NVIDIA’s AI supercomputer, we can accelerate our processing capacity to innovate and launch AI-enabled capabilities that help us manage, move and keep our clients’ assets safe.”</p>
<p>Powered by its new system, BNY Mellon plans to use <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise software</a> to support the build and deployment of AI applications and manage AI infrastructure.</p>
<h2>NVIDIA AI Software: A Key Component in BNY Mellon’s Toolbox</h2>
<p>Founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1784, BNY Mellon oversees nearly $50 trillion in assets for its clients and helps companies and institutions worldwide access the money they need, support governments in funding local projects, safeguard investments for millions of individuals and more.</p>
<p>BNY Mellon has long been at the forefront of AI and accelerated computing in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/finance/">financial services industry</a>. Its AI Hub has more than 20 AI-enabled solutions in production. These solutions support predictive analytics, automation and anomaly detection, among other capabilities.</p>
<p>While the firm recognizes that AI presents opportunities to enhance its processes to reduce risk across the organization, it is also actively working to consider and manage potential risks associated with AI through its robust risk management and governance processes.</p>
<p>Some of the use cases supported by DGX SuperPOD include deposit forecasting, payment automation, predictive trade analytics and end-of-day cash balances.</p>
<p>More are coming. The company identified more than 600 opportunities in AI during a firmwide exercise last year, and dozens are already in development using such NVIDIA AI Enterprise software as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/triton-inference-server/">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/base-command/">NVIDIA Base Command</a>.</p>
<p>Triton Inference Server is inference-serving software that streamlines AI inferencing or puts trained AI models to work.</p>
<p>Base Command powers the DGX SuperPOD, delivering the best of NVIDIA software that enables businesses and their data scientists to accelerate AI development.</p>
<p>NeMo is an end-to-end platform for developing custom generative AI, anywhere. It includes tools for training, and retrieval-augmented generation, guardrailing and toolkits, data curation tools, and pretrained models, offering enterprises an easy, cost-effective, and fast way to adopt generative AI.</p>
<h2>Fueling Innovation Through Top Talent</h2>
<p>With the new DGX SuperPOD, these tools will enable BNY Mellon to streamline and accelerate innovation within the firm and across the global financial system.</p>
<p>Hundreds of data scientists, solutions architects and risk, control and compliance professionals have been using the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-platform">NVIDIA DGX platform</a>, which delivers the world’s leading solutions for enterprise AI development at scale, for several years.</p>
<p>By leveraging their new NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD will help the company rapidly expand its on-premises AI infrastructure.</p>
<p>The new system also underscores the company’s commitment to adopting new technologies and attracting top talent across the world to help drive its innovation agenda forward.</p>
