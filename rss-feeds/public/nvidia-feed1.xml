					<description><![CDATA[NVIDIA Broadcast offers AI-powered features that improve audio and video quality for a variety of use cases.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/"><i>AI Decoded series</i></a><i>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.</i></p>
<p>AI has changed computing forever. The spotlight has most recently been on generative AI, but AI-accelerated, NVIDIA RTX-powered tools have also been key in improving gaming, content creation and productivity over the years.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/">NVIDIA Broadcast app</a> is one example, using Tensor Cores on a local RTX GPU to seamlessly improve audio and video quality. Paired with the NVIDIA encoder (<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-codec-sdk">NVENC</a>) built into GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs, the app makes it easy to get started as a livestreamer or to look professional during video conference calls.</p>
<h2><b>The Stream Dream</b></h2>
<p><iframe title="Broadcasting With NVIDIA GeForce RTX | NVENC vs x264 Quality Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/viWuC4MMXWc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>High-quality livestreaming traditionally required expensive hardware. Many livestreamers relied on software CPU encoding using the x264 software library, which often impacted gameplay quality. This led many to use a dual-PC setup, with one PC focused on gaming and content and the other on encoding the stream. It was complicated to assemble, difficult to troubleshoot and often cost-prohibitive for budding livestreamers.</p>
<p>NVENC is here to help. It’s a dedicated hardware video encoder on NVIDIA GPUs that processes the encoding, freeing up the rest of the system to focus on game and content performance. Industry-leading streaming apps like Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) are adding support for NVENC, paving the way for a new generation of broadcasters on popular platforms like Twitch and YouTube.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/maxine">NVIDIA Maxine</a> helps solve the issue of expensive equipment. It includes free, AI-powered features like virtual green screens and webcam-based augmented reality tracking that eliminate the need for special equipment like physical green screens or motion- capture suits. Broadcasters first got to experience the technology at TwitchCon 2019, where they tested OBS live on the show floor with an AI-accelerated green screen on a GeForce RTX 2080 GPU.</p>
<p>Maxine’s AI-powered effects debuted for RTX users in the RTX Voice beta, and moved into the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/">NVIDIA Broadcast</a> app.</p>
<h2><b>Now Showing: NVIDIA Broadcast</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA Broadcast offers AI-powered features that improve audio and video quality for a variety of use cases. It’s user-friendly, works in any app and is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/broadcast-app-setup-guide/#Quick-Start-Guide">breeze to set up</a>.</p>
<p>It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Noise and Acoustic Echo Removal:</b> AI eliminates unwanted background noise from both the mic and inbound audio at the touch of a button.</li>
<li><b>Virtual Backgrounds:</b> Features like Background Removal, Replacement and Blur help customize backgrounds without the need for expensive equipment or complex lighting setups.</li>
<li><b>Eye Contact: </b>AI helps make it appear as though a streamer is looking directly at the camera, even when they’re glancing off camera or taking notes.</li>
<li><b>Auto Frame: </b>Dynamically tracks movements in real time, automatically cropping and zooming moving objects regardless of their position.</li>
<li><b>Vignette:</b> AI applies a darkening effect to the corners of camera images, providing visual contrast to draw attention to the center of the video and adding stylistic flair.</li>
<li><b>Video Noise Removal:</b> Removes visual noise from low-light situations for a cleaner picture.</li>
</ul>
<p>NVIDIA Broadcast works by creating a virtual camera, microphone or speaker in Windows so that users can set up their devices once and use them in any broadcasting, video conferencing or voice chat apps, including Discord, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, OBS Studio, Slack, Webex and Zoom.</p>
<p>Those with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX, TITAN RTX, NVIDIA RTX or Quadro RTX GPU can use their GPU’s dedicated Tensor Cores to help the app’s AI networks run in real time.</p>
<p>The same AI-powered technology in NVIDIA Broadcast is also available to app developers as a software development kit. Audiovisual technology company Elgato includes Maxine’s AI audio noise removal technology in its <a target="_blank" href="https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/7665204543117-Wave-Link-How-to-use-NVIDIA-Broadcast-Noise-Removal-by-Elgato">Wave Link</a> software, while VTube Studio — a popular app for connecting a 3D model to a webcam for streaming as an animated character — offers an <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178540/VTube_Studio__NVIDIA_Broadcast_Tracker/">RTX-accelerated model tracker</a> plug-in as a free download. Independent developer Xaymar uses NVIDIA Maxine in his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xaymar.com/projects/voicefx/">VoiceFX</a> plug-in.</p>
<p>Content creators can use this plug-in or Elgato’s virtual studio technology (VST) filter to clean up noise and echo from recordings in post-processing in video editing suites like Adobe Premiere Pro or in digital audio workstations like Ableton Live and Adobe Audition.</p>
<h2><b>(Not) Hearing Is Believing</b></h2>
<p>Since its release, NVIDIA Broadcast has been used by millions.</p>
<p>“I’ve utilized the video noise removal and background replacement the most,” said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/mr_vudoo">Mr_Vudoo</a>, a Twitch personality and broadcaster. “The eye contact feature was very interesting and quite honestly took me by surprise at how well it worked.”</p>
<p>Unmesh Dinda, host of the YouTube channel <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@PiXimperfect/featured">PiXimperfect</a>, demonstrated NVIDIA Broadcast’s noise-canceling and echo-removal AI features in an extreme scenario. He set an electric fan whirring directly into his microphone and donned a helmet that was intensely hammered on. Even with these loud sounds in the background, Dinda could be heard crystal clear with Broadcast’s noise-removal feature turned on. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/ClTp4_Hp867/?hl=en">The video</a> has racked up more than 12 million views.</p>
<p><iframe title="Remove ALL Background Noise with One Click! #Shorts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEurXLfzXfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA Broadcast is also a useful tool for the growing remote workforce. In an article, Tom’s Hardware editor-in-chief Avram Piltch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-broadcast-tested">detailed his testing</a> of the app’s noise reduction features against noisy air conditioners, lawn-mowing neighbors and even a robot-wielding, tantrum-throwing child. Broadcast’s AI audio filters prevailed every time:</p>
<p>“I got my eight-year-old to fake throwing a fit right behind me and, once I enabled noise removal, every whine of ‘I’m not going to bed’ went silent (at least on the recording),” said Piltch. “To double the challenge, we had him throw a tantrum while carrying around a robot car with whirring treads. Once again, NVIDIA Broadcast removed all of the unwanted sound.”</p>
<p>Even everyday scenarios like video calls with a medical professional benefit from NVIDIA Broadcast’s AI-powered background removal.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today I was video calling my doctor and she complimented me on how good the background blurring on my webcam looked.</p>
<p>It caught me so off guard, I didn&#39;t know how to respond, so I just gave her a step by step tutorial on how to use NVIDIA Broadcast <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f629.png" alt="😩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Generative AI has revolutionized software development with prompt-based code generation — protein design is next.</p>
<p>EvolutionaryScale today announced the release of its ESM3 model, the third-generation ESM model, which simultaneously reasons over the sequence, structure and functions of proteins, giving protein discovery engineers a programmable platform.</p>
<p>The startup, which emerged from the Meta FAIR (Fundamental AI Research) unit, recently landed funding led by Lux Capital, Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, with investment from NVIDIA and Amazon.</p>
<p>At the forefront of programmable biology, EvolutionaryScale can assist researchers in engineering proteins that can help target cancer cells, find alternatives to harmful plastics, drive environmental mitigations and more.</p>
<p>EvolutionaryScale is pioneering the frontier of programmable biology with the scale-out model development of ESM3, which used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> for the most compute ever put into a biological foundation model. The 98 billion parameter ESM3 model uses roughly 25x more flops and 60x more data than its predecessor, ESM2.</p>
<p>The company, which developed a database of more than 2 billion protein sequences to train its AI model, offers technology that can provide clues applicable to drug development, disease eradication and, literally, how humans have evolved at scale as a species — as its name suggests — for drug discovery researchers.</p>
<h2><b>Accelerating In Silico Biological Research With ESM3</b></h2>
<p>With leaps in training data, EvolutionaryScale aims to accelerate protein discovery with ESM3.</p>
<p>The model was trained on almost 2.8 billion protein sequences sampled from organisms and biomes, allowing scientists to prompt the model to identify and validate new proteins with increasing levels of accuracy.</p>
<p>ESM3 offers significant updates over previous versions. The model is natively generative, and it is an “all to all” model, meaning structure and function annotations can be provided as input rather than just as output.</p>
<p>Once it’s made publicly available, scientists can fine-tune this base model to construct purpose-built models based on their own proprietary data. The boost in protein engineering capabilities due to ESM3’s large-scale generative training across enormous amounts of data offers a time-traveling machine for in silico biological research.</p>
<h2><b>Driving the Next Big Breakthroughs With NVIDIA BioNeMo</b></h2>
<p>ESM3 provides biologists and protein designers with a generative AI boost, helping improve their engineering and understanding of proteins. With simple prompts, it can generate new proteins with a provided scaffold, self-improve its protein design based on feedback and design proteins based on the functionality that the user indicates. These capabilities can be used in tandem in any combination to provide chain-of-thought protein design as if the user were messaging a researcher who had memorized the intricate three-dimensional meaning of every protein sequence known to humans and had learned the language fluently, enabling users to iterate back and forth.</p>
<p>“In our internal testing we’ve been impressed by the ability of ESM3 to creatively respond to a variety of complex prompts,” said Tom Sercu, co-founder and VP of engineering at EvolutionaryScale. “It was able to solve an extremely hard protein design problem to create a novel Green Fluorescent Protein. We expect ESM3 will help scientists accelerate their work and open up new possibilities — we’re looking forward to seeing how it will contribute to future research in the life sciences.”</p>
<p>EvolutionaryScale will be opening an API for closed beta today and code and weights are available for a small open version of ESM3 for non-commercial use. This version is coming soon to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a>, a generative AI platform for drug discovery. The full ESM3 family of models will soon be available to select customers as an <a target="_blank" href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.avanan.click%2Fv2%2F___https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fai%2F%2523referrer%3Dai-subdomain%3Fncid%3Dpa-srch-goog-772333%26_bt%3D697697685508%26_bk%3Dnvidia%2520nim%26_bm%3De%26_bn%3Dg%26_bg%3D165151891361%26gad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMI5pHT7fvjhgMVVXN_AB1KOQFuEAAYASAAEgKvWfD_BwE___.YXAzOm91dGNhc3Q6YTpvOjViNjRiMzE4MDU2MWMwZDcyNThmMmI4NWZhYTViNTJiOjY6NDI2ZTphZWVjMmY1N2JjMjFiM2NhODBiNmFmMjFiZTM2YTQyZWM1NDMwZTZhODdmZTYwOWEyZGRiODc2MWJlMGY2MzUxOmg6VA&amp;data=05%7C02%7Crkelleher%40nvidia.com%7C789b16235c954beed3a908dc8ff9ab8b%7C43083d15727340c1b7db39efd9ccc17a%7C0%7C0%7C638543549716443890%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=wD96MHFHOJjySVQjvo%2FqotZ6KMUZX7Lcr%2FMHAbyGW%2FU%3D&amp;reserved=0">NVIDIA NIM</a> microservice, run-time optimized in collaboration with NVIDIA, and supported by an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software license for testing at ai.nvidia.com.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Multi-die chips, known as three-dimensional integrated circuits, or 3D-ICs, represent a revolutionary step in semiconductor design. The chips are vertically stacked to create a compact structure that boosts performance without increasing power consumption.</p>
<p>However, as chips become denser, they present more complex challenges in managing electromagnetic and thermal stresses. To understand and address this, advanced 3D multiphysics visualizations become essential to design and diagnostic processes.</p>
<p>At this week’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dac.com/">Design Automation Conference</a>, a global event showcasing the latest developments in chips and systems, Ansys — a company that develops engineering simulation and 3D design software — will share how it’s using NVIDIA technology to overcome these challenges to build the next generation of semiconductor systems.</p>
<p>To enable 3D visualizations of simulation results for their users, Ansys uses <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform of application programming interfaces, software development kits, and services that enables developers to easily integrate <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)</a> and NVIDIA RTX rendering technologies into existing software tools and simulation workflows.</p>
<p>The platform powers visualizations of 3D-IC results from Ansys solvers so engineers can evaluate phenomena like electromagnetic fields and temperature variations to optimize chips for faster processing, increased functionality and improved reliability.</p>
<p>With Ansys Icepak on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform, engineers can simulate temperatures across a chip according to different power profiles and floor plans. Finding chip hot-spots can lead to better design of the chips themselves, as well as auxiliary cooling devices. However, these 3D-IC simulations are computationally intensive, limiting the number of simulations and design points users can explore.</p>
<p>Using <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus">NVIDIA Modulus, combined with</a> novel techniques for handling arbitrary power patterns in the Ansys RedHawk-SC electrothermal data pipeline and model training framework, the Ansys R&amp;D team is exploring the acceleration of simulation workflows with AI-based surrogate models. Modulus is an open-source AI framework for building, training and fine-tuning physics-ML models at scale with a simple Python interface.</p>
<p>With the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/modulus-v2209/user_guide/theory/architectures.html">NVIDIA Modulus Fourier neural operator </a>(FNO) architecture, which can parameterize solutions for a distribution of partial differential equations, Ansys researchers created an AI surrogate model that efficiently predicts temperature profiles for any given power profile and a given floor plan defined by system parameters like heat transfer coefficient, thickness and material properties. This model offers near real-time results at significantly reduced computational costs, allowing Ansys users to explore a wider design space for new chips.</p>
<figure id="attachment_72730" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72730" style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ansys-Copy.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-72730 size-full" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ansys-Copy.png" alt="" width="399" height="133" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ansys-Copy.png 399w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ansys-Copy-188x63.png 188w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-72730" class="wp-caption-text">Ansys uses a 3D FNO model to infer temperatures on a chip surface for unseen power profiles, a given die height and heat-transfer coefficient boundary condition.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Following a successful proof of concept, the Ansys team will explore integration of such AI surrogate models for its next-generation RedHawk-SC platform using NVIDIA Modulus.</p>
<p>As more surrogate models are developed, the team will also look to enhance model generality and accuracy through in-situ fine-tuning. This will enable RedHawk-SC users to benefit from faster simulation workflows, access to a broader design space and the ability to refine models with their own data to foster innovation and safety in product development.</p>
<p><i>To see the joint demonstration of 3D-IC multiphysics visualization using NVIDIA Omniverse APIs, </i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ansys.com/events/dac"><i>visit Ansys at the Design Automation Conference</i></a><i>, running June 23-27, in San Francisco at booth 1308 or watch the </i><a target="_blank" href="https://61dac.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=EF119&amp;sess=sess280"><i>presentation</i></a><i> at the Exhibitor Forum.</i></p>

<h2><b>How AI Workbench Helps Address AI Project Challenges</b></h2>
<p>Developing AI workloads can require manual, often complex processes, right from the start.</p>
<p>Setting up GPUs, updating drivers and managing versioning incompatibilities can be cumbersome. Reproducing projects across different systems can require replicating manual processes over and over. Inconsistencies when replicating projects, like issues with data fragmentation and version control, can hinder collaboration. Varied setup processes, moving credentials and secrets, and changes in the environment, data, models and file locations can all limit the portability of projects.</p>
<p>AI Workbench makes it easier for data scientists and developers to manage their work and collaborate across heterogeneous platforms. It integrates and automates various aspects of the development process, offering:<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ease of setup:</b> AI Workbench streamlines the process of setting up a developer environment that’s GPU-accelerated, even for users with limited technical knowledge.</li>
<li><b>Seamless collaboration: </b>AI Workbench integrates with version-control and project-management tools like GitHub and GitLab, reducing friction when collaborating.</li>
<li><b>Consistency when scaling from local to cloud:</b> AI Workbench ensures consistency across multiple environments, supporting scaling up or down from local workstations or PCs to data centers or the cloud.<b></b></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>RAG for Documents, Easier Than Ever</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA offers sample development <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/overview/projects.html">Workbench Projects</a> to help users get started with AI Workbench. The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/workbench-example-hybrid-rag">hybrid RAG Workbench Project</a> is one example: It runs a custom, text-based RAG web application with a user’s documents on their local workstation, PC or remote system.</p>
<p>Every Workbench Project runs in a “container” — software that includes all the necessary components to run the AI application. The hybrid RAG sample pairs a Gradio chat interface frontend on the host machine with a containerized RAG server — the backend that services a user’s request and routes queries to and from the vector database and the selected <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language model</a>.</p>
<p>This Workbench Project supports a wide variety of LLMs <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/workbench-example-hybrid-rag?tab=readme-ov-file#table-1-default-supported-models-by-inference-mode">available on NVIDIA’s GitHub page</a>. Plus, the hybrid nature of the project lets users select where to run inference.</p>
<figure id="attachment_72265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72265" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-72265" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-672x382.png" alt="" width="672" height="382" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-672x382.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-400x228.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-768x437.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-791x450.png 791w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-378x215.png 378w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-176x100.png 176w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-1280x728.png 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects.png 1413w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-72265" class="wp-caption-text">Workbench Projects let users version the development environment and code.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Developers can run the embedding model on the host machine and run inference locally on a Hugging Face Text Generation Inference server, on target cloud resources using NVIDIA inference endpoints like the <a target="_blank" href="http://build.nvidia.com">NVIDIA API catalog</a>, or with self-hosting microservices such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> or third-party services.</p>
<p>The hybrid RAG Workbench Project also includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Performance metrics:</b> Users can evaluate how RAG- and non-RAG-based user queries perform across each inference mode. Tracked metrics include Retrieval Time, Time to First Token (TTFT) and Token Velocity.</li>
<li><b>Retrieval transparency:</b> A panel shows the exact snippets of text — retrieved from the most contextually relevant content in the vector database — that are being fed into the LLM and improving the response’s relevance to a user’s query.</li>
<li><b>Response customization:</b> Responses can be tweaked with a variety of parameters, such as maximum tokens to generate, temperature and frequency penalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get started with this project, simply <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/">install AI Workbench</a> on a local system. The hybrid RAG Workbench Project can be brought from GitHub into the user’s account and duplicated to the local system.</p>
<p>More resources are available in the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/quickstart/example-projects.html">AI Decoded user guide</a>. In addition, community members provide helpful video tutorials, like the one from Joe Freeman below.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA AI Workbench Topology running on Windows, WSL and Linux  with an example" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTA3D4LJfc0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Customize, Optimize, Deploy</b></h2>
<p>Developers often seek to customize AI models for specific use cases. Fine-tuning, a technique that changes the model by training it with additional data, can be useful for style transfer or changing model behavior. AI Workbench helps with fine-tuning, as well.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/RTX-AI-Toolkit/blob/main/tutorial-llama3-finetune.md">Llama-factory AI Workbench Project</a> enables QLoRa, a fine-tuning method that minimizes memory requirements, for a variety of models, as well as model quantization via a simple graphical user interface. Developers can use public or their own datasets to meet the needs of their applications.</p>
<p>Once fine-tuning is complete, the model can be quantized for improved performance and a smaller memory footprint, then deployed to native Windows applications for local inference or to NVIDIA NIM for cloud inference. Find a complete tutorial for this project on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/RTX-AI-Toolkit">NVIDIA RTX AI Toolkit repository</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Truly Hybrid — Run AI Workloads Anywhere</b></h2>
<p>The Hybrid-RAG Workbench Project described above is hybrid in more than one way. In addition to offering a choice of inference mode, the project can be run locally on NVIDIA RTX workstations and GeForce RTX PCs, or scaled up to remote cloud servers and data centers.</p>
<p>The ability to run projects on systems of the user’s choice — without the overhead of setting up the infrastructure — extends to all Workbench Projects.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>The electric grid and the utilities managing it have an important role to play in the next industrial revolution that’s being driven by AI and accelerated computing, said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang Tuesday at the annual meeting of the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), an association of U.S. and international utilities.</p>
<p>“The future of digital intelligence is quite bright, and so the future of the energy sector is bright, too,” said Huang in a conversation before an audience of more than a thousand utility and energy industry executives.</p>
<p>Like other companies, utilities will apply AI to increase employee productivity, but “the greatest impact and return is in applying AI in the delivery of energy over the grid,” said Huang, in conversation with Pedro Pizarro, the chair of EEI and president and CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, one of the nation’s largest electric utilities.</p>
<p>For example, Huang described how grids will use AI-powered smart meters to let customers sell their excess electricity to neighbors.</p>
<p>“You will connect resources and users, just like Google, so your power grid becomes a smart network with a digital layer like an app store for energy,” he said.</p>
<p>“My sense is, like previous industrial revolutions, [AI] will drive productivity to levels that we’ve never seen,” he added.</p>
<h2><b>AI Lights Up Electric Grids</b></h2>
<p>Today, electric grids are mainly one-way systems that link a few big power plants to many users. They’ll increasingly become two-way, flexible and distributed networks with solar and wind farms connecting homes and buildings that sport solar panels, batteries and electric vehicle chargers.</p>
<p>It’s a big job that requires autonomous control systems that process and analyze in real time a massive amount of data — work well suited to AI and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/">accelerated computing</a>.</p>
<p>AI is being applied to use cases across electric grids, thanks to a wide ecosystem of companies using NVIDIA’s technologies.</p>
<p>In a recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s61864/">GTC session</a>, utility vendor Hubbell and startup Utilidata, a member of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a> program, described a new generation of smart meters using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a> platform that utilities will deploy to process and analyze real-time grid data using AI models at the edge. Deloitte <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deloitte-and-utilidata-establish-first-of-its-kind-collaboration-to-revolutionize-the-us-power-grid-for-a-sustainable-future-302175120.html">announced</a> today its support for the effort.</p>
<p>Siemens Energy detailed in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62524/">a separate GTC session</a> its work with AI and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> creating digital twins of transformers in substations to improve predictive maintenance, boosting grid resilience. And <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-energy-utilities/maximize-wind-energy">a video</a> reports on how Siemens Gamesa used Omniverse and accelerated computing to optimize turbine placements for a large wind farm.</p>
<p>“Deploying AI and advanced computing technologies developed by NVIDIA enables faster and better grid modernization and we, in turn, can deliver for our customers,” said Maria Pope, CEO of Portland General Electric in Oregon.</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA Delivers 45,000x Gain in Energy Efficiency</b></h2>
<p>The advances come as NVIDIA drives down the costs and energy needed to deploy AI.</p>
<p>Over the last eight years, NVIDIA increased <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/energy-efficiency/">energy efficiency</a> of running AI inference on state-of-the-art large language models a whopping 45,000x, Huang said in his recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKXDVsWZmUU">keynote</a> at COMPUTEX.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/">NVIDIA Blackwell architecture GPUs</a> will provide 20x greater energy efficiency than CPUs for AI and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/high-performance-computing/">high-performance computing</a>. If all CPU servers for these jobs transitioned to GPUs, users would save 37 terawatt-hours a year, the equivalent of 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and the electricity use of 5 million homes.</p>
<p>That’s why NVIDIA-powered systems swept the top six spots and took seven of the top 10 in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/green500-energy-efficient-supercomputers/">the latest ranking</a> of the <a target="_blank" href="https://top500.org/lists/green500/2024/06/">Green500</a>, a list of the world’s most energy-efficient supercomputers.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-energy-study/">a recent report</a> calls for governments to accelerate adoption of AI as a significant new tool to drive energy efficiency across many industries. It cited examples of utilities adopting AI to make the electric grid more efficient.</p>
<p>Learn more about how <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/energy/power-utilities/">utilities are deploying AI</a> and accelerated computing to improve operations, saving cost and energy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>NVIDIA researchers are at the forefront of the rapidly advancing field of visual generative AI, developing new techniques to create and interpret images, videos and 3D environments.</p>
<p>More than 50 of these projects will be showcased at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/cvpr/">Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)</a> conference, taking place June 17-21 in Seattle. Two of the papers — one on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NVlabs/edm2">training dynamics of diffusion models</a> and another on <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16439">high-definition maps for autonomous vehicles</a> — are finalists for CVPR’s Best Paper Awards.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is also the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/auto-research-cvpr-2024/">winner of the CVPR Autonomous Grand Challenge’s End-to-End Driving at Scale</a> track — a significant milestone that demonstrates the company’s use of generative AI for comprehensive self-driving models. The winning submission, which outperformed more than 450 entries worldwide, also received CVPR’s Innovation Award.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s research at CVPR includes a text-to-image model that can be easily customized to depict a specific object or character, a new model for object pose estimation, a technique to edit neural radiance fields (<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-decoded-instant-nerf/">NeRFs</a>) and a visual language model that can understand memes. Additional papers introduce domain-specific innovations for industries including automotive, healthcare and robotics.</p>
<p>Collectively, the work introduces powerful AI models that could enable creators to more quickly bring their artistic visions to life, accelerate the training of autonomous robots for manufacturing, and support healthcare professionals by helping process radiology reports.</p>
<p>“Artificial intelligence, and generative AI in particular, represents a pivotal technological advancement,” said Jan Kautz, vice president of learning and perception research at NVIDIA. “At CVPR, NVIDIA Research is sharing how we’re pushing the boundaries of what’s possible — from powerful image generation models that could supercharge professional creators to autonomous driving software that could help enable next-generation self-driving cars.”</p>
<p>At CVPR, NVIDIA also announced <a target="_blank" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/omniverse-microservices-physical-ai">NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX</a>, a set of microservices that enable physically accurate sensor simulation to accelerate the development of fully autonomous machines of every kind.</p>
<h2><b>Forget Fine-Tuning: JeDi Simplifies Custom Image Generation</b></h2>
<p>Creators harnessing diffusion models, the most popular method for generating images based on text prompts, often have a specific character or object in mind — they may, for example, be developing a storyboard around an animated mouse or brainstorming an ad campaign for a specific toy.</p>
<p>Prior research has enabled these creators to personalize the output of diffusion models to focus on a specific subject using fine-tuning — where a user trains the model on a custom dataset — but the process can be time-consuming and inaccessible for general users.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/jedi/">JeDi</a>, a paper by researchers from Johns Hopkins University, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago and NVIDIA, proposes a new technique that allows users to easily personalize the output of a diffusion model within a couple of seconds using reference images. The team found that the model achieves state-of-the-art quality, significantly outperforming existing fine-tuning-based and fine-tuning-free methods.</p>
<p>JeDi can also be combined with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, or RAG, to generate visuals specific to a database, such as a brand’s product catalog.</p>
<div style="width: 1452px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-72167-1" width="1452" height="680" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JeDi-cow-sculpture.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JeDi-cow-sculpture.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JeDi-cow-sculpture.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>New Foundation Model Perfects the Pose</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA researchers at CVPR are also presenting <a target="_blank" href="https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/">FoundationPose</a>, a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/">foundation model</a> for object pose estimation and tracking that can be instantly applied to new objects during inference, without the need for fine-tuning.</p>
<p>The model, which <a target="_blank" href="https://bop.felk.cvut.cz/leaderboards/pose-estimation-unseen-bop23/core-datasets/">set a new record</a> on a popular benchmark for object pose estimation, uses either a small set of reference images or a 3D representation of an object to understand its shape. It can then identify and track how that object moves and rotates in 3D across a video, even in poor lighting conditions or complex scenes with visual obstructions.</p>
<p>FoundationPose could be used in industrial applications to help autonomous robots identify and track the objects they interact with. It could also be used in augmented reality applications where an AI model is used to overlay visuals on a live scene.</p>

<h2><b>NeRFDeformer Transforms 3D Scenes With a Single Snapshot</b></h2>
<p>A NeRF is an AI model that can render a 3D scene based on a series of 2D images taken from different positions in the environment. In fields like robotics, NeRFs can be used to generate immersive 3D renders of complex real-world scenes, such as a cluttered room or a construction site. However, to make any changes, developers would need to manually define how the scene has transformed — or remake the NeRF entirely.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and NVIDIA have simplified the process with NeRFDeformer. The method, being presented at CVPR, can successfully transform an existing NeRF using a single RGB-D image, which is a combination of a normal photo and a depth map that captures how far each object in a scene is from the camera.</p>

<h2><b>VILA Visual Language Model Gets the Picture</b></h2>
<p>A CVPR research collaboration between NVIDIA and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is advancing the state of the art for vision language models, which are generative AI models that can process videos, images and text.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Making moves to accelerate self-driving car development, NVIDIA was today named an Autonomous Grand Challenge winner at the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/cvpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</a> (CVPR) conference, running this week in Seattle.</p>
<p>Building on last year’s win in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/autonomous-driving-challenge-cvpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3D Occupancy Prediction</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Research</a> topped the leaderboard this year in the <a href="https://opendrivelab.com/challenge2024/#end_to_end_driving_at_scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">End-to-End Driving at Scale category</a> with its Hydra-MDP model, outperforming more than 400 entries worldwide.</p>
<p>This milestone shows the importance of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> in building applications for physical AI deployments in autonomous vehicle (AV) development. The technology can also be applied to industrial environments, healthcare, robotics and other areas.</p>
<p>The winning submission received CVPR’s Innovation Award as well, recognizing NVIDIA’s approach to improving “any end-to-end driving model using learned open-loop proxy metrics.”</p>
<p>In addition, NVIDIA announced <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/omniverse-microservices-physical-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX</a>, a set of microservices that enable physically accurate sensor simulation to accelerate the development of fully autonomous machines of every kind.</p>
<h2><b>How End-to-End Driving Works</b></h2>
<p>The race to develop self-driving cars isn’t a sprint but more a never-ending triathlon, with three distinct yet crucial parts operating simultaneously: AI training, simulation and autonomous driving. Each requires its own accelerated computing platform, and together, the full-stack systems purpose-built for these steps form a powerful triad that enables continuous development cycles, always improving in performance and safety.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, a model is first trained on an AI supercomputer such as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DGX</a>. It’s then tested and validated in simulation — using the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platform and running on an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ovx/">NVIDIA OVX</a> system — before entering the vehicle, where, lastly, the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/products/agx-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DRIVE AGX</a> platform processes sensor data through the model in real time.</p>
<p>Building an autonomous system to navigate safely in the complex physical world is extremely challenging. The system needs to perceive and understand its surrounding environment holistically, then make correct, safe decisions in a fraction of a second. This requires human-like situational awareness to handle potentially dangerous or rare scenarios.</p>
<p>AV software development has traditionally been based on a modular approach, with separate components for object detection and tracking, trajectory prediction, and path planning and control.</p>
<p>End-to-end autonomous driving systems streamline this process using a unified model to take in sensor input and produce vehicle trajectories, helping avoid overcomplicated pipelines and providing a more holistic, data-driven approach to handle real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>Watch a video about the Hydra-MDP model, winner of the CVPR Autonomous Grand Challenge for End-to-End Driving:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA Research Wins CVPR Autonomous Grand Challenge for End-to-End Driving" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wfpLLSz5iWY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Navigating the Grand Challenge </b></h2>
<p>This year’s CVPR challenge asked participants to develop an end-to-end AV model, trained using the nuPlan dataset, to generate driving trajectory based on sensor data.</p>
<p>The models were submitted for testing inside the open-source NAVSIM simulator and were tasked with navigating thousands of scenarios they hadn’t experienced yet. Model performance was scored based on metrics for safety, passenger comfort and deviation from the original recorded trajectory.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Research’s winning end-to-end model ingests camera and lidar data, as well as the vehicle’s trajectory history, to generate a safe, optimal vehicle path for five seconds post-sensor input.</p>
<p>The workflow NVIDIA researchers used to win the competition can be replicated in high-fidelity simulated environments with NVIDIA Omniverse. This means AV simulation developers can recreate the workflow in a physically accurate environment before testing their AVs in the real world. NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX microservices will be available later this year. <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse/join" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sign up</a> for early access.</p>
<p>In addition, NVIDIA ranked second for its submission to the CVPR Autonomous Grand Challenge for <a href="https://opendrivelab.com/challenge2024/#driving_with_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Driving with Language</a>. NVIDIA’s approach connects vision language models and autonomous driving systems, integrating the power of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language models</a> to help make decisions and achieve generalizable, explainable driving behavior.</p>
<h2><b>Learn More at CVPR </b></h2>
<p>More than <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/cvpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 NVIDIA papers</a> were accepted to this year’s CVPR, on topics spanning automotive, healthcare, robotics and more. Over a dozen papers will cover NVIDIA automotive-related research, including:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>NVIDIA contributed the largest ever indoor synthetic dataset to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/cvpr/">Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)</a> conference’s annual <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aicitychallenge.org/">AI City Challenge</a> — helping researchers and developers advance the development of solutions for smart cities and industrial automation.</p>
<p>The challenge, garnering over 700 teams from nearly 50 countries, tasks participants to develop AI models to enhance operational efficiency in physical settings, such as retail and warehouse environments, and intelligent traffic systems.</p>
<p>Teams tested their models on the datasets that were generated using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform of application programming interfaces (APIs), software development kits (SDKs) and services that enable developers to build <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)</a>-based applications and workflows.</p>
<h2><b>Creating and Simulating Digital Twins for Large Spaces</b></h2>
<p>In large indoor spaces like factories and warehouses, daily activities involve a steady stream of people, small vehicles and future autonomous robots. Developers need solutions that can observe and measure activities, optimize operational efficiency, and prioritize human safety in complex, large-scale settings.</p>
<p>Researchers are addressing that need with computer vision models that can perceive and understand the physical world. It can be used in applications like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5M4sqaRd6w">multi-camera tracking</a>, in which a model tracks multiple entities within a given environment.</p>
<p>To ensure their accuracy, the models must be trained on large, ground-truth datasets for a variety of real-world scenarios. But collecting that data can be a challenging, time-consuming and costly process.</p>
<p>AI researchers are turning to physically based simulations — such as digital twins of the physical world — to enhance AI simulation and training. These virtual environments can help generate <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/use-cases/synthetic-data/">synthetic data</a> used to train AI models. Simulation also provides a way to run a multitude of “what-if” scenarios in a safe environment while addressing privacy and AI bias issues.</p>
<p>Creating synthetic data is important for AI training because it offers a large, scalable, and expandable amount of data. Teams can generate a diverse set of training data by changing many parameters including lighting, object locations, textures and colors.</p>
<h2><b>Building Synthetic Datasets for the AI City Challenge</b></h2>
<p>This year’s AI City Challenge consists of five computer vision challenge tracks that span traffic management to worker safety.</p>
<p>NVIDIA contributed datasets for the first track, Multi-Camera Person Tracking, which saw the highest participation, with over 400 teams. The challenge used a benchmark and the largest synthetic dataset of its kind — comprising 212 hours of 1080p videos at 30 frames per second spanning 90 scenes across six virtual environments, including a warehouse, retail store and hospital.</p>
<p>Created in Omniverse, these scenes simulated nearly 1,000 cameras and featured around 2,500 digital human characters. It also provided a way for the researchers to generate data of the right size and fidelity to achieve the desired outcomes.</p>
<p>The benchmarks were created using Omniverse Replicator in <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim">NVIDIA Isaac Sim</a>, a reference application that enables developers to design, simulate and train AI for robots, smart spaces or autonomous machines in physically based virtual environments built on NVIDIA Omniverse.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/replicator_tutorials/tutorial_replicator_omni_replicator_agent.html">Omniverse Replicator</a>, an SDK for building synthetic data generation pipelines, automated many manual tasks involved in generating quality synthetic data, including domain randomization, camera placement and calibration, character movement, and semantic labeling of data and ground-truth for benchmarking.</p>
<p>Ten institutions and organizations are collaborating with NVIDIA for the AI City Challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Australian National University, Australia</li>
<li>Emirates Center for Mobility Research, UAE</li>
<li>Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India</li>
<li>Iowa State University, U.S.</li>
<li>Johns Hopkins University, U.S.</li>
<li>National Yung-Ming Chiao-Tung University, Taiwan</li>
<li>Santa Clara University, U.S.</li>
<li>The United Arab Emirates University, UAE</li>
<li>University at Albany – SUNY, U.S.</li>
<li>Woven by Toyota, Japan</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Driving the Future of Generative Physical AI </b></h2>
<p>Researchers and companies around the world are developing infrastructure automation and robots powered by physical AI — which are models that can understand instructions and autonomously perform complex tasks in the real world.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYSfcgVv9-U">Generative physical AI</a> uses reinforcement learning in simulated environments, where it perceives the world using accurately simulated sensors, performs actions grounded by laws of physics, and receives feedback to reason about the next set of actions.</p>
<p>Developers can tap into developer SDKs and APIs, such as the NVIDIA Metropolis developer stack — which includes a <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimize-processes-for-large-spaces-with-the-multi-camera-tracking-workflow/">multi-camera tracking reference workflow</a> — to add enhanced perception capabilities for factories, warehouses and retail operations. And with <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/supercharge-robotics-workflows-with-ai-and-simulation-using-nvidia-isaac-sim-4-0-and-nvidia-isaac-lab/">the latest release of NVIDIA Isaac Sim</a>, developers can supercharge robotics workflows by simulating and training AI-based robots in physically based virtual spaces before real-world deployment.</p>
<p>Researchers and developers are also combining high-fidelity, physics-based simulation with advanced AI to bridge the gap between<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/closing-the-sim-to-real-gap-training-spot-quadruped-locomotion-with-nvidia-isaac-lab/"> simulated training and real-world application</a>. This helps ensure that synthetic training environments closely mimic real-world conditions for more seamless robot deployment.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is taking the accuracy and scale of simulations further with the recently <a target="_blank" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/omniverse-microservices-physical-ai">announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX</a>, a set of microservices that enable physically accurate sensor simulation to accelerate the development of fully autonomous machines.</p>
<p>This technology will allow autonomous systems, whether a factory, vehicle or robot, to gather essential data to effectively perceive, navigate and interact with the real world. Using these microservices, developers can run large-scale tests on sensor perception within realistic, virtual environments, significantly reducing the time and cost associated with real-world testing.</p>
<p>Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX microservices will be available later this year. <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse/join">Sign up</a> for early access.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang on Friday encouraged Caltech graduates to pursue their craft with dedication and resilience — and to view setbacks as new opportunities.</p>
<p>“I hope you believe in something. Something unconventional, something unexplored. But let it be informed, and let it be reasoned, and dedicate yourself to making that happen,” he said. “You may find your GPU. You may find your CUDA. You may find your generative AI. You may find your NVIDIA.”</p>
<p>Trading his signature leather jacket for black and yellow academic regalia, Huang addressed the nearly 600 graduates at their commencement ceremony in Pasadena, Calif., starting with the tale of the computing industry’s decades-long evolution to reach this pivotal moment of AI transformation.</p>
<p>“Computers today are the single most important instrument of knowledge, and it’s foundational to every single industry in every field of science,” Huang said. “As you enter industry, it’s important you know what’s happening.”</p>
<p>He shared how, over a decade ago, NVIDIA — a small company at the time — bet on deep learning, investing billions of dollars and years of engineering resources to reinvent every computing layer.</p>
<p>“No one knew how far deep learning could scale, and if we didn’t build it, we’d never know,” Huang said. Referencing the famous line from <i>Field of Dreams</i> — if you build it, he will come — he said, “Our logic is: If we don’t build it, they can’t come.”</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Huang said, the next wave of AI is robotics, a field where NVIDIA’s journey resulted from a series of setbacks.</p>
<p>He reflected on a period in NVIDIA’s past when the company each year built new products that “would be incredibly successful, generate enormous amounts of excitement. And then one year later, we were kicked out of those markets.”</p>
<p>These roadblocks pushed NVIDIA to seek out untapped areas — what Huang refers to as “zero-billion-dollar markets.”</p>
<p>“With no more markets to turn to, we decided to build something where we are sure there are no customers,” Huang said. “Because one of the things you can definitely guarantee is where there are no customers, there are also no competitors.”</p>
<p>Robotics was that new market. NVIDIA built the first robotics computer, Huang said, processing a deep learning algorithm. Over a decade later, that pivot has given the company the opportunity to create the next wave of AI.</p>
<p>“One setback after another, we shook it off and skated to the next opportunity. Each time, we gain skills and strengthen our character,” Huang said. “No setback that comes our way doesn’t look like an opportunity these days.”</p>
<p>Huang stressed the importance of resilience and agility as superpowers that strengthen character.</p>
<p>“The world can be unfair and deal you with tough cards. Swiftly shake it off,” he said, with a tongue-in-cheek reference to one of Taylor Swift’s biggest hits. “There’s another opportunity out there — or create one.”</p>
<p>Huang concluded by sharing a story from his travels to Japan, where, as he watched a gardener painstakingly tending to Kyoto’s famous moss garden, he realized that when a person is dedicated to their craft and prioritizes doing their life’s work, they always have plenty of time.</p>
<p>“Prioritize your life,” he said, “and you will have plenty of time to do the important things.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p dir="ltr">NVIDIA today announced Nemotron-4 340B, a family of open models that developers can use to generate synthetic data for training large language models (LLMs) for commercial applications across healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail and every other industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">High-quality training data plays a critical role in the performance, accuracy and quality of responses from a custom LLM — but robust datasets can be prohibitively expensive and difficult to access.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Through a uniquely permissive <a href="https://developer.download.nvidia.com/licenses/nvidia-open-model-license-agreement-june-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open model license</a>, Nemotron-4 340B gives developers a free, scalable way to generate synthetic data that can help build powerful LLMs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Nemotron-4 340B family includes base, instruct and reward models that form a pipeline to generate synthetic data used for training and refining LLMs. The models are optimized to work with <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, an open-source framework for end-to-end model training, including data curation, customization and evaluation. They’re also optimized for inference with the open-source <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a> library.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nemotron-4 340B can be downloaded now from the <a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/models?filters=&amp;orderBy=scoreDESC&amp;query=nemotron-4-340b">NVIDIA NGC</a> catalog and from <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-4-340b-666b7ebaf1b3867caf2f1911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugging Face</a>, where developers can also use the <a title="Original URL:
https://huggingface.co/blog/train-dgx-cloud

Click to follow link." target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/blog/train-dgx-cloud" data-outlook-id="5193062f-d639-42ed-b23f-b53853ee7065">Train on DGX Cloud</a> service to easily fine-tune open AI models. Developers will soon be able to access the models at <a href="http://ai.nvidia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ai.nvidia.com</a>, where they’ll be packaged as an <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-nim-offers-optimized-inference-microservices-for-deploying-ai-models-at-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA NIM</a> microservice with a standard application programming interface that can be deployed anywhere.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Navigating Nemotron to Generate Synthetic Data</h2>
<p dir="ltr">LLMs can help developers generate synthetic training data in scenarios where access to large, diverse labeled datasets is limited.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/nemotron-4-340b-instruct" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nemotron-4 340B Instruct</a> model creates diverse synthetic data that mimics the characteristics of real-world data, helping improve data quality to increase the performance and robustness of custom LLMs across various domains.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then, to boost the quality of the AI-generated data, developers can use the <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/nemotron-4-340b-reward" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nemotron-4 340B Reward</a> model to filter for high-quality responses. Nemotron-4 340B Reward grades responses on five attributes: helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity and verbosity. It’s currently first place on the <a target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/allenai/reward-bench">Hugging Face RewardBench leaderboard</a>, created by <a href="https://allenai.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI2</a>, for evaluating the capabilities, safety and pitfalls of reward models.</p>
<figure id="attachment_72168" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72168" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Synthetic-Data-Generation-Pipeline-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-72168 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Synthetic-Data-Generation-Pipeline-672x378.jpg" alt="nemotron synthetic data generation pipeline diagram" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Synthetic-Data-Generation-Pipeline-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Synthetic-Data-Generation-Pipeline-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Synthetic-Data-Generation-Pipeline-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Synthetic-Data-Generation-Pipeline-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Synthetic-Data-Generation-Pipeline-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Synthetic-Data-Generation-Pipeline-800x450.jpg 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Synthetic-Data-Generation-Pipeline-382x215.jpg 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Synthetic-Data-Generation-Pipeline-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Synthetic-Data-Generation-Pipeline-1280x720.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-72168" class="wp-caption-text">In this synthetic data generation pipeline, (1) the Nemotron-4 340B Instruct model is first used to produce synthetic text-based output. An evaluator model, (2) Nemotron-4 340B Reward, then assesses this generated text — providing feedback that guides iterative improvements and ensures the synthetic data is accurate, relevant and aligned with specific requirements.</figcaption></figure>
<p dir="ltr">Researchers can also create their own instruct or reward models by customizing the <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/nemotron-4-340b-base" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nemotron-4 340B Base</a> model using their proprietary data, combined with the included <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HelpSteer2 dataset</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Fine-Tuning With NeMo, Optimizing for Inference With TensorRT-LLM</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Using open-source NVIDIA NeMo and NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, developers can optimize the efficiency of their instruct and reward models to generate synthetic data and to score responses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All Nemotron-4 340B models are optimized with TensorRT-LLM to take advantage of tensor parallelism, a type of model parallelism in which individual weight matrices are split across multiple GPUs and servers, enabling efficient inference at scale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nemotron-4 340B Base, trained on 9 trillion tokens, can be customized using the NeMo framework to adapt to specific use cases or domains. This fine-tuning process benefits from extensive pretraining data and yields more accurate outputs for specific downstream tasks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A variety of customization methods are available through the NeMo framework, including supervised fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as low-rank adaptation, or LoRA.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To boost model quality, developers can align their models with <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeMo Aligner</a> and datasets annotated by Nemotron-4 340B Reward. Alignment is a key step in training LLMs, where a model’s behavior is fine-tuned using algorithms like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to ensure its outputs are safe, accurate, contextually appropriate and consistent with its intended goals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Businesses seeking enterprise-grade support and security for production environments can also access NeMo and TensorRT-LLM through the cloud-native <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform, which provides accelerated and efficient runtimes for generative AI foundation models.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Evaluating Model Security and Getting Started</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Nemotron-4 340B Instruct model underwent extensive safety evaluation, including adversarial tests, and performed well across a wide range of risk indicators. Users should still perform careful evaluation of the model’s outputs to ensure the synthetically generated data is suitable, safe and accurate for their use case.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For more information on model security and safety evaluation, read the model card.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>When she was five years old, Veronica Miller (née Teklai) and her family left their homeland of Eritrea, in the Horn of Africa, to escape an ongoing war with Ethiopia and create a new life in the U.S.</p>
<p>She grew up in East Orange, New Jersey, watching others judge her parents and turn them away from jobs they were qualified for because of their appearance, their accented English or their unfamiliar names.</p>
<p>After working in the shipping industry for 20 years, Miller’s dad eventually became a New York City cab driver, an often-dangerous job in the 1980s. Her mom, despite earning a computer science degree in the U.S., trained to become a home health aide, where jobs were more available.</p>
<p>“My parents’ resilience and courage made my life possible,” Miller said.<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF3787-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-72099 size-medium" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF3787-267x400.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="400" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF3787-267x400.jpg 267w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF3787-333x500.jpg 333w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF3787-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF3787-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF3787-scaled.jpg 1365w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF3787-300x450.jpg 300w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF3787-143x215.jpg 143w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF3787-67x100.jpg 67w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF3787-1280x1920.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" /></a></p>
<p>After graduating from Ramapo College of New Jersey with a degree in international business, Miller worked at large automotive companies in client support, production support and project management.</p>
<p>Now working as a technical program manager in product security at NVIDIA, she feels like her family’s journey has come full circle.</p>
<p>“It’s the honor of my life being here at NVIDIA: I’m the proudest refugee,” she said.</p>
<p>In her role, Miller functions like a conductor in an orchestra. She works with engineers to bridge gaps and understand challenges to define solutions — always trying to create opportunities to turn a “no” into a “yes” through collaboration.</p>
<p>At NVIDIA, Miller feels like she can be herself, helping her thrive. She no longer feels the pressure to conform to fit in, allowing her creativity to flow freely and solve problems.</p>
<p>“Previously in my career, I never wore my hair curly. After someone once asked to touch my curly hair, I believed it would be easier to make myself look like everyone else. I thought it was the best way to let my work be the focus instead of my hair,” she said. “NVIDIA is the first employer that encouraged me to bring my full self to work.”</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF4399-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-72105 size-medium" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF4399-400x267.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF4399-400x267.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF4399-672x448.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF4399-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF4399-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF4399-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF4399-675x450.jpg 675w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF4399-323x215.jpg 323w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF4399-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/webDSCF4399-1280x853.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>Outside of work, Miller and her husband, Nathan, are passionate about paying it forward and helping local youth in Trenton, New Jersey. Together, they’ve developed The Miller Family Foundation to help with community needs, including education. The foundation’s scholarship fund has donated $20,000 to low-income high school students to provide support for college tuition and career mentorship.</p>
<p>“I truly believe anyone could get here. There wasn’t anyone that showed me the path. It was belief in myself, a ton of research and endless hard work,” she said. “We’re in a special place where my husband and I can give the next generation some of the financial support and career guidance we didn’t have.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Accelerated computing is transforming data processing and analytics for enterprises, declared NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang Wednesday during an on-stage chat with Databricks cofounder and CEO Ali Ghodsi at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.databricks.com/dataaisummit">Databricks Data + AI Summit 2024</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every company’s business data is their gold mine,” Huang said, explaining that every company has enormous amounts of data, but extracting insights and distilling intelligence from it has been challenging.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SAsoWmMhX3Q?si=XL2clmsl3yIimqzn" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>Databricks Leverages NVIDIA’s Full Stack to Accelerate Generative AI Applications</h2>
<p>To unlock all that intelligence, Huang and Ghodsi announced the integration of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/">NVIDIA’s accelerated computing</a> with Databricks Photon, Databricks’ engine for fast data processing, designed to power Databricks SQL with top-tier performance and cost efficiency.</p>
<p>“This is a big announcement,” Huang said, adding that accelerated computing and generative AI are the two most important technological trends today. “NVIDIA and Databricks are going to partner to combine our skills in these areas and bring them to all of you.”</p>
<p>Huang shared that it’s taken NVIDIA five years to build a set of libraries that make it possible to accelerate Photon, allowing users to “wrangle data faster, more cost-effectively and consume a lot less energy.”</p>
<p>“We are super-excited to partner with you to use GPU acceleration on the Photon engine to enhance core data processing and get them to also run on NVIDIA GPUs,” Ghodsi said.</p>
<h2>Creating Generative AI Factories With NVIDIA NIM</h2>
<p>NVIDIA and Databricks also announced that Databricks’ open-source model DBRX is now available as an <a target="_blank" href="http://ai.nvidia.com">NVIDIA NIM</a> microservice hosted on the NVIDIA API catalog.</p>
<p>NVIDIA NIM inference microservices provide models as fully optimized, pre-built containers for deployment anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creating these endpoints is complicated,” Huang explained. “We optimized everything into a microservice, which runs on every cloud and on premises.”</p>
<p>Microservices dramatically increase enterprise developer productivity by providing a simple, standardized way to add generative AI models to applications.</p>
<p>Launched in March, DBRX was built entirely on top of Databricks, leveraging all the tools and techniques available to Databricks customers and partners, and was trained with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a>, a scalable end-to-end AI platform for developers.</p>
<p>Organizations can customize DBRX with enterprise data to create high-quality, organization-specific models or use it to build a custom DBRX-style mixture of expert models as a reference architecture.</p>
<p>Huang said that accelerating data processing is a huge opportunity, encouraging everyone to put accelerated computing and generative AI to work.</p>
<p>“Whatever you do, just start — you have to engage in this incredibly fast-moving train,” Huang said. “Remember, generative AI is growing exponentially — you don’t want to wait and observe an exponential trend, because in a couple of years, you’ll be so far behind.”</p>
<h2>Joining the Conversation</h2>
<p>Attendees at the summit are encouraged to participate in sessions and engage with NVIDIA experts to learn more about how NVIDIA and Databricks are driving the future of AI and data intelligence.</p>
<p>Key sessions, taking place June 13, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Development and Deployment of Generative AI with NVIDIA” at 12:30 p.m. PT</li>
<li>“Architecture Analysis for ETL Processing: CPU vs. GPU” at 4:30 p.m. PT;</li>
<li>“Spark RAPIDS ML: GPU Accelerated Distributed ML in Spark Clusters” at 1:30 p.m. PT</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>The full-stack NVIDIA accelerated computing platform has once again demonstrated exceptional performance in the latest MLPerf Training v4.0 benchmarks.</p>
<p>NVIDIA more than tripled the performance on the large language model (LLM) benchmark, based on GPT-3 175B, compared to the record-setting NVIDIA submission made last year. Using an AI supercomputer featuring 11,616 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> connected with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/">NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand</a> networking, NVIDIA  achieved this remarkable feat through larger scale — more than triple that of the 3,584 H100 GPU submission a year ago — and extensive full-stack engineering.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MLPerf-4-training-results-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-72193" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MLPerf-4-training-results-672x410.jpg" alt="NVIDIA Hopper GPUs lead MLPerf 4.0 results in AI training" width="672" height="410" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MLPerf-4-training-results-672x410.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MLPerf-4-training-results-400x244.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MLPerf-4-training-results-768x469.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MLPerf-4-training-results-1536x938.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MLPerf-4-training-results-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MLPerf-4-training-results-737x450.jpg 737w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MLPerf-4-training-results-352x215.jpg 352w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MLPerf-4-training-results-164x100.jpg 164w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MLPerf-4-training-results-1280x782.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>Thanks to the scalability of the NVIDIA AI platform, Eos can now train massive AI models like GPT-3 175B even faster, and this great AI performance translates into significant business opportunities. For example, in NVIDIA’s recent earnings call, we described how LLM service providers can turn a single dollar invested into seven dollars in just four years running the Llama 3 70B model on NVIDIA HGX H200 servers. This return assumes an LLM service provider serving Llama 3 70B at $0.60/M tokens, with an HGX H200 server throughput of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/meta-llama3-inference-acceleration/">24,000 tokens/second</a>.</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA</b> <b>H200 GPU Supercharges Generative AI and HPC </b></h2>
<p>The NVIDIA H200 Tensor GPU builds upon the strength of the Hopper architecture, with 141GB of HBM3 memory and over 40% more memory bandwidth compared to the H100 GPU. Pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI training, the NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPU extended the H100’s performance by up to 47% in its MLPerf Training debut.</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA Software Drives Unmatched Performance Gains</b></h2>
<p>Additionally, our submissions using a 512 H100 GPU configuration are now up to 27% faster compared to just one year ago due to numerous optimizations to the NVIDIA software stack. This improvement highlights how continuous software enhancements can significantly boost performance, even with the same hardware.</p>
<p>This work also delivered nearly perfect scaling. As the number of GPUs increased by 3.2x — going from 3,584 H100 GPUs last year to 11,616 H100 GPUs with this submission — so did the delivered performance.</p>
<p>Learn more about these optimizations on the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-sets-new-generative-ai-performance-and-scale-records-in-mlperf-training-v4-0/">NVIDIA Technical Blog</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Excelling at LLM Fine-Tuning</b></h2>
<p>As enterprises seek to customize pretrained large language models, LLM fine-tuning is becoming a key industry workload. MLPerf introduced a new LLM fine-tuning benchmark this round, based on the popular low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique applied to Meta Llama 2 70B.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA platform excelled at this task, scaling from eight to 1,024 GPUs, with the largest-scale NVIDIA submission completing the benchmark in a record 1.5 minutes.</p>
<h2><b>Accelerating Stable Diffusion and GNN Training</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA also accelerated Stable Diffusion v2 training performance by up to 80% at the same system scales submitted last round. These advances reflect numerous enhancements to the NVIDIA software stack, showcasing how software and hardware improvements go hand-in-hand to deliver top-tier performance.</p>
<p>On the new graph neural network (GNN) test based on R-GAT, the NVIDIA platform with H100 GPUs excelled at both small and large scales. The H200 delivered a 47% boost on single-node GNN training compared to the H100. This showcases the powerful performance and high efficiency of NVIDIA GPUs, which make them ideal for a wide range of AI applications.</p>
<h2><b>Broad Ecosystem Support</b></h2>
<p>Reflecting the breadth of the NVIDIA AI ecosystem, 10 NVIDIA partners submitted results, including ASUS, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Oracle, Quanta Cloud Technology, Supermicro and Sustainable Metal Cloud. This broad participation, and their own impressive benchmark results, underscores the widespread adoption and trust in NVIDIA’s AI platform across the industry.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://mlcommons.org/">MLCommons</a>’ ongoing work to bring benchmarking best practices to AI computing is vital. By enabling peer-reviewed comparisons of AI and HPC platforms, and keeping pace with the rapid changes that characterize AI computing, MLCommons provides companies everywhere with crucial data that can help guide important purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>And with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/">NVIDIA Blackwell</a> platform, next-level AI performance on trillion-parameter generative AI models for both training and inference is coming soon.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The era of the AI PC is here, and it’s powered by NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX technologies. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>AI Decoded series</i></a><i>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.</i></p>
<p>The era of the AI PC is here, and it’s powered by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/desktop-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX</a> technologies. With it comes a new way to evaluate performance for AI-accelerated tasks, and a new language that can be daunting to decipher when choosing between the desktops and laptops available.</p>
<p>While PC gamers understand frames per second (FPS) and similar stats, measuring AI performance requires new metrics.</p>
<h2><b>Coming Out on TOPS</b></h2>
<p>The first baseline is TOPS, or trillions of operations per second. Trillions is the important word here — the processing numbers behind <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> tasks are absolutely massive. Think of TOPS as a raw performance metric, similar to an engine’s horsepower rating. More is better.</p>
<p>Compare, for example, the recently announced Copilot+ PC lineup by Microsoft, which includes neural processing units (NPUs) able to perform upwards of 40 TOPS. Performing 40 TOPS is sufficient for some light AI-assisted tasks, like asking a local chatbot where yesterday’s notes are.</p>
<p>But many generative AI tasks are more demanding. NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX GPUs deliver unprecedented performance across all generative tasks — the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU offers more than 1,300 TOPS. This is the kind of horsepower needed to handle AI-assisted digital content creation, AI super resolution in PC gaming, generating images from text or video, querying local <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language models</a> (LLMs) and more.</p>
<h2><b>Insert Tokens to Play</b></h2>
<p>TOPS is only the beginning of the story. LLM performance is measured in the number of tokens generated by the model.</p>
<p>Tokens are the output of the LLM. A token can be a word in a sentence, or even a smaller fragment like punctuation or whitespace. Performance for AI-accelerated tasks can be measured in “tokens per second.”</p>
<p>Another important factor is batch size, or the number of inputs processed simultaneously in a single inference pass. As an LLM will sit at the core of many modern AI systems, the ability to handle multiple inputs (e.g. from a single application or across multiple applications) will be a key differentiator. While larger batch sizes improve performance for concurrent inputs, they also require more memory, especially when combined with larger models.</p>
<figure id="attachment_72118" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72118" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NV-chart.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-72118" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NV-chart-672x322.png" alt="" width="672" height="322" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NV-chart-672x322.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NV-chart-400x192.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NV-chart-768x368.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NV-chart-1536x737.png 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NV-chart-842x404.png 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NV-chart-406x195.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NV-chart-188x90.png 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NV-chart-1280x614.png 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NV-chart.png 1880w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-72118" class="wp-caption-text">The more you batch, the more (time) you save.</figcaption></figure>
<p>RTX GPUs are exceptionally well-suited for LLMs due to their large amounts of dedicated video random access memory (VRAM), Tensor Cores and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt#section-inference-for-llms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TensorRT-LLM</a> software.</p>
<p>GeForce RTX GPUs offer up to 24GB of high-speed VRAM, and NVIDIA RTX GPUs up to 48GB, which can handle larger models and enable higher batch sizes. RTX GPUs also take advantage of Tensor Cores — dedicated AI accelerators that dramatically speed up the computationally intensive operations required for deep learning and generative AI models. That maximum performance is easily accessed when an application uses the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA TensorRT</a> software development kit (SDK), which unlocks the highest-performance generative AI on the more than 100 million Windows PCs and workstations powered by RTX GPUs.</p>
<p>The combination of memory, dedicated AI accelerators and optimized software gives RTX GPUs massive throughput gains, especially as batch sizes increase.</p>
<h2><b>Text-to-Image, Faster Than Ever</b></h2>
<p>Measuring image generation speed is another way to evaluate performance. One of the most straightforward ways uses Stable Diffusion, a popular image-based AI model that allows users to easily convert text descriptions into complex visual representations.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Accelerate Stable Diffusion with NVIDIA RTX GPUs" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fUAEBoJCJW8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>With Stable Diffusion, users can quickly create and refine images from text prompts to achieve their desired output. When using an RTX GPU, these results can be generated faster than processing the AI model on a CPU or NPU.</p>
<p>That performance is <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-decoded-tensorrt-stable-diffusion-automatic1111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even higher</a> when using the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-TensorRT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TensorRT extension</a> for the popular Automatic1111 interface. RTX users can generate images from prompts up to 2x faster with the SDXL Base checkpoint — significantly streamlining Stable Diffusion workflows.</p>
<p>ComfyUI, another popular Stable Diffusion user interface, added <a href="https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI_TensorRT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TensorRT acceleration</a> last week. RTX users can now generate images from prompts up to 60% faster, and can even convert these images to videos using Stable Video Diffuson up to 70% faster with TensorRT.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Generate Images Faster with Stable Diffusion and RTX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/64QEVfbPHyg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>TensorRT acceleration can be put to the test in the new UL Procyon AI Image Generation benchmark, which delivers speedups of 50% on a GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER GPU compared with the fastest non-TensorRT implementation.</p>
<p>TensorRT acceleration will soon be released for Stable Diffusion 3 — Stability AI’s new, highly anticipated text-to-image model — boosting performance by 50%. Plus, the new <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerate-generative-ai-inference-performance-with-nvidia-tensorrt-model-optimizer-now-publicly-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TensorRT-Model Optimizer</a> enables accelerating performance even further. This results in a 70% speedup compared with the non-TensorRT implementation, along with a 50% reduction in memory consumption.</p>
<p>Of course, seeing is believing — the true test is in the real-world use case of iterating on an original prompt. Users can refine image generation by tweaking prompts significantly faster on RTX GPUs, taking seconds per iteration compared with minutes on a Macbook Pro M3 Max. Plus, users get both speed and security with everything remaining private when running locally on an RTX-powered PC or workstation.</p>
<h2><b>The Results Are in and Open Sourced</b></h2>
<p>But don’t just take our word for it. The team of AI researchers and engineers behind the open-source <a href="http://jan.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jan.ai</a> recently integrated <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TensorRT-LLM</a> into its local chatbot app, then <a href="https://jan.ai/post/benchmarking-nvidia-tensorrt-llm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested</a> these optimizations for themselves.</p>
<figure id="attachment_72112" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72112" style="width: 648px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chart.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-72112" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chart.png" alt="" width="648" height="437" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chart.png 648w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chart-400x270.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chart-319x215.png 319w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chart-148x100.png 148w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-72112" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Jan.ai</figcaption></figure>
<p>The researchers tested its implementation of TensorRT-LLM against the open-source llama.cpp inference engine across a variety of GPUs and CPUs used by the community. They found that TensorRT is “30-70% faster than llama.cpp on the same hardware,” as well as more efficient on consecutive processing runs. The team also included its methodology, inviting others to measure generative AI performance for themselves.</p>
<p>From games to generative AI, speed wins. TOPS, images per second, tokens per second and batch size are all considerations when determining performance champs.</p>
