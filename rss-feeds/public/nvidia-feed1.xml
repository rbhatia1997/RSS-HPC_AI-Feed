					<description><![CDATA[NVIDIA RTX technology-powered AI helps turn such an imagination into reality. Using Instant NeRF, creatives are transforming collections of still images into digital 3D scenes in just seconds.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><em>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </em><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/"><em>AI Decoded series</em></a><em>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and which showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.</em></p>
<p>Imagine a gorgeous vista, like a cliff along the water’s edge. Even as a 2D image, the scene would be beautiful and inviting. Now imagine exploring that same view in 3D – without needing to be there.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a> technology-powered AI helps turn such an imagination into reality. Using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/instant-nerf-research-3d-ai/">Instant NeRF</a>, creatives are <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/how-nerfs-helped-me-re-imagine-the-world/">transforming collections of still images into digital 3D scene</a>s in just seconds.</p>
<h2><strong>Simply Radiant</strong></h2>
<p>A NeRF, or neural radiance field, is an AI model that takes 2D images representing a scene as input and interpolates between them to render a complete 3D scene. The model operates as a neural network — a model that replicates how the brain is organized and is often used for tasks that require pattern recognition.</p>
<p>Using spatial location and volumetric rendering, a NeRF uses the camera pose from the images to render a 3D iteration of the scene. Traditionally, these models are computationally intensive, requiring large amounts of rendering power and time.</p>
<p>A recent NVIDIA AI research project changed that.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/getting-started-with-nvidia-instant-nerfs/">Instant NeRF</a> takes NeRFs to the next level, using AI-accelerated inverse rendering to approximate how light behaves in the real world. It enables researchers to construct a 3D scene from 2D images taken at different angles. Scenes can now be generated in seconds, and the longer the NeRF model is trained, the more detailed the resulting 3D renders.</p>
<p>NVIDIA researchers released four neural graphics primitives, or <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-pretrained-ai-model/">pretrained</a> datasets, as part of the <a href="https://nvlabs.github.io/instant-ngp/">Instant-NGP</a> training toolset at the SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference in 2022. The tools let anyone create NeRFs with their own data. The researchers won a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/instant-nerf-creators-siggraph/">best paper award</a> for the work, and <em>TIME Magazine</em> named Instant NeRF a <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/time-magazine-names-nvidia-instant-nerf-a-best-invention-of-2022/">best invention of 2022</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to speeding rendering for NeRFs, Instant NeRF makes the entire image reconstruction process accessible using NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX desktop and laptop GPUs. While the time it takes to render a scene depends on factors like dataset size and the mix of image and video source content, the AI training doesn’t require server-grade or cloud-based hardware.</p>
<p>NVIDIA RTX workstations and GeForce RTX PCs are ideally suited to meet the computational demands of rendering NeRFs. NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX GPUs feature Tensor Cores, dedicated AI hardware accelerators that provide the horsepower to run generative AI locally.</p>
<h2><strong>Ready, Set, Go</strong></h2>
<p>Get started with Instant NeRF to learn about radiance fields and experience imagery in a new way.</p>
<p>Developers and tech enthusiasts can download the source-code base to compile. Nontechnical users can download the Windows installers for <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp">Instant-NGP</a><a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp"> software, available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>While the installer is available for a wide range of RTX GPUs, the program performs best on the latest-architecture <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/">GeForce RTX 40 Series</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/ada-architecture/">NVIDIA RTX Ada Generation</a> GPUs.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/getting-started-with-nvidia-instant-nerfs/">“Getting Started With Instant NeRF”</a> guide walks users through the process, including loading one of the primitives, such as “NeRF Fox,” to get a sense of what’s possible. Detailed instructions and video walkthroughs — like the one above — demonstrate how to create NeRFs with custom data, including tips for capturing good input imagery and compiling codebases (if built from source). The guide also covers using the Instant NeRF graphical user interface, optimizing scene parameters and creating an animation from the scene.</p>
<p>The NeRF community also offers many tips and tricks to help users get started. For example, check out the livestream below and this technical <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/getting-started-with-nvidia-instant-nerfs/">blog post</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Show and Tell</strong></h2>
<p>Digital artists are composing beautiful scenes and telling fresh stories with NVIDIA Instant NeRF. The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/ai-art-gallery/instant-nerf/">Instant NeRF gallery</a> showcases some of the most innovative and thought-provoking examples, viewable as video clips in any web browser.</p>
<p>Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Through the Looking Glass” by Karen X. Cheng and James Perlman </strong>A pianist practices her song, part of her daily routine, though there’s nothing mundane about what happens next. The viewer peers into the mirror, a virtual world that can be observed but not traversed; it’s unreachable by normal means. Then, crossing the threshold, it’s revealed that this mirror is in fact a window into an inverted reality that can be explored from within. Which one is real?</li>
</ul>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-71152-1" width="1280" height="680" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/studio-ai-decoded-karenx-v9-1280x680-1.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/studio-ai-decoded-karenx-v9-1280x680-1.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/studio-ai-decoded-karenx-v9-1280x680-1.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Meditation” by Franc Lucent </strong>As soon as they walked into one of many rooms in Nico Santucci’s estate, Lucent knew they needed to turn it into a NeRF. Playing with the dynamic range and reflections in the pond, it presented the artist with an unknown exploration. They were pleased with the softness of the light and the way the NeRF elevates the room into what looks like something out of a dream — the perfect place to meditate. A NeRF can freeze a moment in a way that’s more immersive than a photo or video.</li>
</ul>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-71152-2" width="1280" height="680" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/studio-ai-decoded-franc-lucent-meditation-1280x680-1.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/studio-ai-decoded-franc-lucent-meditation-1280x680-1.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/studio-ai-decoded-franc-lucent-meditation-1280x680-1.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Zeus” by Hugues Bruyère </strong>These rendered 3D scenes with Instant NeRF use the data Bruyère previously captured for traditional photogrammetry using mirrorless digital cameras, smartphones, 360-degree cameras and drones. Instant NeRF gives him a powerful tool to help preserve and share cultural artifacts through online libraries, museums, virtual-reality experiences and heritage-conservation projects. This NeRF was trained using a dataset of photos taken with an iPhone at the Royal Ontario Museum.</li>
</ul>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-71152-3" width="1280" height="680" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/studio-ai-decoded-hugues-zeus-1280x680-1.mp4?_=3" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/studio-ai-decoded-hugues-zeus-1280x680-1.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/studio-ai-decoded-hugues-zeus-1280x680-1.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>From Image to Video to Reality</strong></h2>
<p>Transforming images into a 3D scene with AI is cool. Stepping into that 3D creation is next level.</p>
<p>Thanks to a recent Instant NeRF update, users can render their scenes from static images and virtually step inside the environments, moving freely within the 3D space. In virtual-reality (VR) environments, users can feel complete immersion into new worlds, all within their headsets.</p>
<p>The potential benefits are nearly endless.</p>
<p>For example, a realtor can create and share a 3D model of a property, offering virtual tours at new levels. Retailers can showcase products in an online shop, powered by a collection of images and AI running on RTX GPUs. These AI models power creativity and are helping drive the accessibility of 3D immersive experiences across other industries.</p>
<p>Instant NeRF comes with the capability to clean up scenes easily in VR, making the creation of high-quality NeRFs more intuitive than ever.

					<description><![CDATA[Amid a flurry of investments in higher education, NVIDIA founder Jensen Huang highlights potential for AI to serve as a “collaborator” as alma mater breaks ground on $213 million research complex. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>AI promises to bring the full benefits of the digital revolution to billions across the globe, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said Friday during a conversation with Oregon State University President Jayathi Murthy.</p>
<p>“I believe that artificial intelligence is the technology industry’s single greatest contribution to social elevation, to lift all of the people that have historically been left behind,” Huang told more than 2,000 faculty, students and staff gathered for his conversation with Murthy.</p>
<p>The talk was the highlight of a forum marking the groundbreaking for a new research building that will be named for Huang and his wife, Lori, both Oregon State alumni.</p>
<p>The facility positions Oregon State as a leader not just in the semiconductor industry but also at the intersection of high performance computing and a growing number of fields.</p>
<figure id="attachment_71079" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71079" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-71079 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groundbreaking-672x448.png" alt="" width="672" height="448" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groundbreaking-672x448.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groundbreaking-400x267.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groundbreaking-768x512.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groundbreaking-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groundbreaking-675x450.png 675w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groundbreaking-323x215.png 323w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groundbreaking-150x100.png 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groundbreaking-1280x853.png 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groundbreaking.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-71079" class="wp-caption-text">Friday’s event at Oregon State University followed the groundbreaking for the Jen-Hsun Huang and Lori Mills Huang Collaborative Innovation Complex. Image courtesy of Oregon State University.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those innovations have world-changing implications.</p>
<p>Huang said those who know a programming language such as C++ typically have greater opportunities.</p>
<p>“Because programming is so hard, the number of people who have benefitted from this, putting it to use for their economic prosperity, has been limited,” Huang said.</p>
<p>AI unlocks that and more.</p>
<p>“So you essentially have a collaborator with you at all times, essentially have a tutor at all times, and so I think the ability for AI to elevate all of the people left behind is quite extraordinary,” he added.</p>
<p>Huang’s appearance in Corvallis, Oregon, capped off a week of announcements underscoring NVIDIA’s commitment to preparing the future workforce with advanced AI, data science and high performance computing training.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, NVIDIA announced that it would participate in a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/partnership-universities-teach-ai-skills/">$110 million partnership between Japan and the United States</a>, which would include funding for university research.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://coe.gatech.edu/news/2024/04/georgia-tech-unveils-new-ai-makerspace-collaboration-nvidia">Georgia Tech announced a new NVIDIA-powered supercomputer</a> that will help prepare undergraduate students to solve complex challenges with AI and HPC.</p>
<p>And later this month, NVIDIA founder Chris Malachowsky will be inducted into the Hall of Fame for the University of Florida’s Department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, following the November inauguration of the university’s $150 million Malachowsky Hall for Data Science &amp; Information Technology.</p>
<h2>Educating Future Leaders for ‘New Industrial Revolution’</h2>
<p>NVIDIA has been investing in universities for decades, providing computing resources, advanced training curricula, donations and other support.</p>
<p>These contributions enable students and professors to access the high performance computing necessary for groundbreaking results at a key moment in the history of the industry.</p>
<p>“We’re at the beginning of a new industrial revolution, and the reason why I say that is because an industrial revolution produces something new that was impossible to produce in the past,” Huang said.</p>
<p>“And in this new world, you can apply electricity, and what’s going to come out of it is a whole bunch of floating-point numbers. We call them tokens, and those tokens are essentially artificial intelligence,” Huang said.</p>
<p>“And so this industrial revolution is going to be manufacturing intelligence at a very large scale,” Huang said.</p>
<h2>OSU Breaks Ground on $213 Million Research Complex</h2>
<p>Friday’s event in Oregon highlighted the Huangs’ commitment to education and reflected the couple’s deep personal ties to Oregon State, where the two met.</p>
<p>The conversation with Murthy followed the groundbreaking for the Jen-Hsun Huang and Lori Mills Huang Collaborative Innovation Complex, which took place Friday morning on the Corvallis campus.</p>
<p>When it opens in 2026, the 150,000-square-foot, $213 million complex — supported by a $50 million gift from the Huangs — will increase Oregon State’s support for the semiconductor and technology industry in Oregon and beyond.</p>
<p>Harnessing one of the nation’s most powerful NVIDIA supercomputers, the complex will bring together faculty and students to solve critical challenges facing the world in areas such as climate science, clean energy and water resources.</p>
<p>Huang sees the center — and AI — as helping put the benefits of computing at the service of people doing work across a broad range of disciplines.</p>
<p>Oregon State is one of the world’s premier schools in forestry, Huang said, adding that “let’s just face it, it’s very unlikely that somebody who was in forestry, it’s not impossible, but C++ is probably not your thing,” Huang said.</p>
<p>Thanks to ChatGPT, you can “now use a computer to apply it to your field of science and apply this computing technology to revolutionize your work.”</p>
<p>That makes learning how to think — and how to collaborate — more important than ever, Huang said. It’s “no different than if I gave you a partner to collaborate with you to solve problems,” Huang said.</p>
<p>“You still need to know how to collaborate, how to prompt, how to frame a problem, how to refine the solution, how to iterate on it and how to change your mind.”</p>
<h2>NVIDIA Joins $110 Million Partnership to Help Universities Teach AI Skills</h2>
<p>The groundbreaking at Oregon State is just one of several announcements highlighting NVIDIA’s global commitment to advancing the global technology industry.</p>
<p>Last week, the Biden Administration announced a new $110 million AI partnership between Japan and the United States, including an initiative to fund research through collaboration between the University of Washington and the University of Tsukuba.</p>
<p>As part of this, NVIDIA is committing $25 million to a collaboration with Amazon to bring the latest technologies to the University of Washington, in Seattle, and the University of Tsukuba, northeast of Tokyo.</p>
<h2>Georgia Tech Unveils New AI Makerspace in Collaboration With NVIDIA</h2>
<p>And on Wednesday, Georgia Tech’s College of Engineering established an AI supercomputing hub dedicated to teaching students.</p>
<p>The AI Makerspace was launched in collaboration with NVIDIA. College leaders call it a “digital sandbox” for students to understand and use AI. Initially focusing on undergraduates, the AI Makerspace aims to democratize access to computing resources typically reserved for researchers or technology companies.</p>
<p>Students will access the cluster online as part of their coursework. The Makerspace will also better position students after graduation as they work with AI professionals and help shape future applications.</p>
<h2>‘Beginning of a New World’</h2>
<p>To be sure, AI has limits, Huang explained. “It’s no different than when you work with teammates or lab partners; you’re guiding each other along because you know each other’s weaknesses and strengths,” he said.</p>
<p>However, Huang said now is a fantastic time to get an education and prepare for a career.</p>
<p>“This is the beginning of a new world and this is the best of times to go to school — the whole world is changing, right? New technology and new capabilities, new instruments and new ways to learn,” Huang said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Skyscrapers start with strong foundations. The same goes for apps powered by AI.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/"><i>AI Decoded series</i></a><i>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and which showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.</i></p>
<p>Skyscrapers start with strong foundations. The same goes for apps powered by AI.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/">foundation model</a> is an AI neural network trained on immense amounts of raw data, generally with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/supervised-unsupervised-learning/">unsupervised learning</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a type of artificial intelligence model trained to understand and generate human-like language. Imagine giving a computer a huge library of books to read and learn from, so it can understand the context and meaning behind words and sentences, just like a human does.</p>
<figure id="attachment_71041" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71041" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/foundation-model.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-71041 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/foundation-model-672x457.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="457" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/foundation-model-672x457.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/foundation-model-400x272.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/foundation-model-768x522.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/foundation-model-662x450.jpg 662w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/foundation-model-316x215.jpg 316w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/foundation-model-147x100.jpg 147w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/foundation-model.jpg 1054w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-71041" class="wp-caption-text">Foundation models.</figcaption></figure>
<p>A foundation model’s deep knowledge base and ability to communicate in natural language make it useful for a broad range of applications, including text generation and summarization, copilot production and computer code analysis, image and video creation, and audio transcription and speech synthesis.</p>
<p>ChatGPT, one of the most notable generative AI applications, is a chatbot built with OpenAI’s GPT foundation model. Now in its fourth version, GPT-4 is a large multimodal model that can ingest text or images and generate text or image responses.</p>
<p>Online apps built on foundation models typically access the models from a data center. But many of these models, and the applications they power, can now run locally on PCs and workstations with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/">NVIDIA GeForce</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a> GPUs.</p>
<h2><strong>Foundation Model Uses</strong></h2>
<p>Foundation models can perform a variety of functions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language processing: understanding and generating text</li>
<li>Code generation: analyzing and debugging computer code in many programming languages</li>
<li>Visual processing: analyzing and generating images</li>
<li>Speech: generating text to speech and transcribing speech to text</li>
</ul>
<p>They can be used as is or with further refinement. Rather than training an entirely new AI model for each generative AI application — a costly and time-consuming endeavor — users commonly fine-tune foundation models for specialized use cases.</p>
<p>Pretrained foundation models are remarkably capable, thanks to prompts and data-retrieval techniques like <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, or RAG. Foundation models also excel at <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-transfer-learning/">transfer learning</a>, which means they can be trained to perform a second task related to their original purpose.</p>
<p>For example, a general-purpose large language model (LLM) designed to converse with humans can be further trained to act as a customer service chatbot capable of answering inquiries using a corporate knowledge base.</p>
<p>Enterprises across industries are fine-tuning foundation models to get the best performance from their AI applications.</p>
<h2><strong>Types of Foundation Models</strong></h2>
<p>More than 100 foundation models are in use — a number that continues to grow. LLMs and image generators are the two most popular types of foundation models. And many of them are free for anyone to try — on any hardware — in the <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover">NVIDIA API Catalog</a>.</p>
<p>LLMs are models that understand natural language and can respond to queries. Google’s <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/google/gemma-7b">Gemma</a> is one example; it excels at text comprehension, transformation and code generation. When asked about the astronomer Cornelius Gemma, it shared that his “contributions to celestial navigation and astronomy significantly impacted scientific progress.” It also provided information on his key achievements, legacy and other facts.</p>
<p>Extending the collaboration <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/google-gemma-llm-rtx-ai-pc/">of the Gemma models</a>, accelerated with the NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM on RTX GPUs, <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/04/gemma-family-expands.html">Google’s CodeGemma</a> brings powerful yet lightweight coding capabilities to the community. CodeGemma models are available as 7B and 2B pretrained variants that specialize in code completion and code generation tasks.</p>
<p>MistralAI’s <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v2">Mistral</a> LLM can follow instructions, complete requests and generate creative text. In fact, it helped brainstorm the headline for this blog, including the requirement that it use a variation of the series’ name “AI Decoded,” and it assisted in writing the definition of a foundation model.</p>

<p>Meta’s <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/meta/llama2-70b">Llama 2</a> is a cutting-edge LLM that generates text and code in response to prompts.</p>
<p>Mistral and Llama 2 are available in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-ph/ai-on-rtx/chat-with-rtx-generative-ai/">NVIDIA ChatRTX</a> tech demo, running on RTX PCs and workstations. ChatRTX lets users personalize these foundation models by connecting them to personal content — such as documents, doctors’ notes and other data — through RAG. It’s accelerated by <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-decoded-tensorrt-stable-diffusion-automatic1111">TensorRT-LLM</a> for quick, contextually relevant answers. And because it runs locally, results are fast and secure.</p>
<p>Image generators like StabilityAI’s <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl">Stable Diffusion XL</a> and <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo">SDXL Turbo</a> let users generate images and stunning, realistic visuals. StabilityAI’s video generator, <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion">Stable Video Diffusion</a>, uses a generative diffusion model to synthesize video sequences with a single image as a conditioning frame.</p>
<p>Multimodal foundation models can simultaneously process more than one type of data — such as text and images — to generate more sophisticated outputs.</p>
<p>A multimodal model that works with both text and images could let users upload an image and ask questions about it. These types of models are quickly working their way into real-world applications like customer service, where they can serve as faster, more user-friendly versions of traditional manuals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Whether delivering live sports programming, streaming services, network broadcasts or content on social platforms, media companies face a daunting landscape.</p>
<p>Viewers are increasingly opting for interactive and personalized content. Virtual reality and augmented reality continue their drive into the mainstream. New video compression standards are challenging traditional computing infrastructure. And AI is having an impact across the board.</p>
<p>In a situation this dynamic, media companies will benefit most from AI-enabled media solutions that flexibly align with their changing development and delivery needs.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Holoscan for Media, available now, is a software-defined platform that enables developers to easily build live media applications, supercharge them with AI and then deploy them across media platforms.</p>
<h2><b>A New Approach to Media Application Development </b></h2>
<p>Holoscan for Media offers a new approach to development in live media. It simplifies application development by providing an internet protocol (IP)-based, cloud-native architecture that isn’t constrained by dedicated hardware, environments or locations. Instead, it integrates open-source and ubiquitous technologies and streamlines application delivery to customers, all while optimizing costs.</p>
<p>Traditional application development for the live media market relies on dedicated hardware. Because software is tied to that hardware, developers are constrained when it comes to innovating or upgrading applications.</p>
<p>Each deployment type, whether on premises or in the cloud, requires its own build, making development costly and inefficient. Beyond designing an application’s user interface and core functionalities, developers have to build out additional infrastructure services, further eating into research and development budgets.</p>
<p>The most significant challenge is incorporating AI, due to the complexity of building an AI software stack. This prevents many applications in pilot programs from moving to production.</p>
<p>Holoscan for Media eases the integration of AI into application development due to its underlying architecture, which enables software-defined video to be deployed on the same software stack as AI applications, including generative AI-based tools. This benefits vendors and research and development departments looking to incorporate AI apps into live video.</p>
<p>Since the platform is cloud-native, the same architecture can run independent of location, whether in the cloud, on premises or at the edge. Additionally, it’s not tied to a specific device, field-programmable gate array or appliance.</p>
<p>The Holoscan for Media architecture includes services like authentication, logging and security, as well as features that help broadcasters migrate to IP-based technologies, including the SMPTE ST 2110 transport protocol, the precision time protocol for timing and synchronization, and the NMOS controller and registry for dynamic device management.</p>
<h2><b>A Growing Ecosystem of Partners</b></h2>
<p>Beamr, Comprimato, Lawo, Media.Monks, Pebble, RED Digital Cinema, Sony Corporation and Telestream are among the early adopters already transforming live media with Holoscan for Media.</p>
<p>“We use Holoscan for Media as the core infrastructure for our broadcast and media workflow, granting us powerful scale to deliver interest-based content across a wide range of channels and platforms,” said Lewis Smithingham, senior vice president of innovation special operations at Media.Monks, a provider of software-defined production workflows.</p>
<p>“By compartmentalizing applications and making them interoperable, Holoscan for Media allows for easy adoption of new innovations from many different companies in one platform,” said Jeff Goodman, vice president of product management at RED Digital Cinema, a manufacturer of professional digital cinema cameras. “It takes much of the integration complexity out of the equation and will significantly increase the pace of innovation. We are very excited to be a part of it.”</p>
<p>“We believe NVIDIA Holoscan for Media is one of the paths forward to enabling the development of next-generation products and services for the industry, allowing the scaling of GPU power as needed,” said Masakazu Murata, senior general manager of media solutions business at Sony Corporation. “Our M2L-X software switcher prototype running on Holoscan for Media demonstrates how customers can run Sony’s solutions on GPU clusters.”</p>
<p>“Telestream is committed to transforming the media landscape, enhancing efficiency and content experiences without sacrificing quality or user-friendliness,” said Charlie Dunn, senior vice president and general manager at Telestream, a provider of digital media software and solutions. “We’ve seamlessly integrated the Holoscan for Media platform into our INSPECT IP video monitoring solution to achieve a clear and efficient avenue for ST 2110 compliance.”</p>
<h2><b>Experience Holoscan for Media at NAB Show</b></h2>
<p>These partners will showcase how they’re using NVIDIA Holoscan for Media at NAB Show, an event for the broadcast, media and entertainment industry, taking place April 13-17 in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>In this episode of NVIDIA’s <a href="https://soundcloud.com/theaipodcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Podcast</a>, recorded live at the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA GTC</a> global AI conference, host Noah Kravitz spoke with the Romanian startup’s founder and CEO, Cornel Amariei, about developing its flagship Dotlumen Glasses.</p>
<p>Equipped with sensors and powered by AI, the glasses compute a safely walkable path for visually impaired individuals and offer haptic — or tactile — feedback on how to proceed via corresponding vibrations. Amariei further discusses the process and challenges of developing assistive technology and its potential for enhancing accessibility.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Non-playable characters often play a crucial role in video game storytelling, but since they’re usually designed with a fixed purpose, they can get repetitive and boring — especially in vast worlds where there are thousands.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/"><i>AI Decoded series</i></a><i>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and which showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.</i></p>
<p>Digital characters are leveling up.</p>
<p>Non-playable characters often play a crucial role in video game storytelling, but since they’re usually designed with a fixed purpose, they can get repetitive and boring — especially in vast worlds where there are thousands.</p>
<p>Thanks in part to incredible advances in visual computing like ray tracing and DLSS, video games are more immersive and realistic than ever, making dry encounters with NPCs especially jarring.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, production microservices for the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine</a> launched, giving game developers and digital creators an ace up their sleeve when it comes to making lifelike NPCs. ACE microservices allow developers to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital avatars in games and applications. With ACE microservices, NPCs can dynamically interact and converse with players in-game and in real time.</p>
<p>Leading game developers, studios and startups are already incorporating ACE into their titles, bringing new levels of personality and engagement to NPCs and digital humans.</p>
<h2><b>Bring Avatars to Life With NVIDIA ACE</b></h2>
<p>The process of creating NPCs starts with providing them a backstory and purpose, which helps guide the narrative and ensures contextually relevant dialogue. Then, ACE subcomponents work together to build avatar interactivity and enhance responsiveness.</p>
<p>NPCs tap up to four AI models to hear, process, generate dialogue and respond.</p>
<p>The player’s voice first goes into <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/riva/">NVIDIA Riva</a>, a technology that builds fully customizable, real-time conversational AI pipelines and turns chatbots into engaging and expressive assistants using GPU-accelerated multilingual speech and translation microservices.</p>
<p>With ACE, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/riva/">Riva’s</a> automatic speech recognition (ASR) feature processes what was said and uses AI to deliver a highly accurate transcription in real time. Explore a Riva-powered <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/riva/#demos">demo of speech-to-text</a> in a dozen languages.</p>
<p>The transcription then goes into an LLM — such as Google’s Gemma, Meta’s Llama 2 or Mistral — and taps Riva’s neural machine translation to generate a natural language text response. Next, Riva’s Text-to-Speech functionality generates an audio response.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/audio2face/">NVIDIA Audio2Face</a> (A2F) generates facial expressions that can be synced to dialogue in many languages. With the microservice, digital avatars can display dynamic, realistic emotions streamed live or baked in during post-processing.</p>
<p>The AI network automatically animates face, eyes, mouth, tongue and head motions to match the selected emotional range and level of intensity. And A2F can automatically infer emotion directly from an audio clip.</p>
<p>Each step happens in real time to ensure fluid dialogue between the player and the character. And the tools are customizable, giving developers the flexibility to build the types of characters they need for immersive storytelling or worldbuilding.</p>
<h2><b>Born to Roll</b></h2>
<p>At GDC and GTC, developers and platform partners showcased demos leveraging NVIDIA ACE microservices — from interactive NPCs in gaming to powerful digital human nurses.</p>
<p>Ubisoft is exploring new types of interactive gameplay with dynamic NPCs. NEO NPCs, the product of its latest research and development project, are designed to interact in real time with players, their environment and other characters, opening up new possibilities for dynamic and emergent storytelling.</p>
<p>The capabilities of these NEO NPCs were showcased through demos, each focused on different aspects of NPC behaviors, including environmental and contextual awareness; real-time reactions and animations; and conversation memory, collaboration and strategic decision-making. Combined, the demos spotlighted the technology’s potential to push the boundaries of game design and immersion.</p>
<p>Using Inworld AI technology, Ubisoft’s narrative team created two NEO NPCs, Bloom and Iron, each with their own background story, knowledge base and unique conversational style. Inworld technology also provided the NEO NPCs with intrinsic knowledge of their surroundings, as well as interactive responses powered by Inworld’s LLM. NVIDIA A2F provided facial animations and lip syncing for the two NPCs real time.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA ACE | NVIDIA x Inworld AI - Pushing the Boundaries of Game Characters in Covert Protocol" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uryeFhnNzEs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Inworld and NVIDIA set GDC abuzz with a new technology demo called Covert Protocol, which showcased NVIDIA ACE technologies and the Inworld Engine. In the demo, players controlled a private detective who completed objectives based on the outcome of conversations with NPCs on the scene. Covert Protocol unlocked social simulation game mechanics with AI-powered digital characters that acted as bearers of crucial information, presented challenges and catalyzed key narrative developments. This enhanced level of AI-driven interactivity and player agency is set to open up new possibilities for emergent, player-specific gameplay.</p>
<p>Built on Unreal Engine 5, Covert Protocol uses the Inworld Engine and NVIDIA ACE, including NVIDIA Riva ASR and A2F, to augment Inworld’s speech and animation pipelines.</p>
<p>In the latest version of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psrXGPh80UM">NVIDIA Kairos</a> tech demo built in collaboration with Convai, which was shown at CES, Riva ASR and A2F were used to significantly improve NPC interactivity. Convai’s new framework allowed the NPCs to converse among themselves and gave them awareness of objects, enabling them to pick up and deliver items to desired areas. Furthermore, NPCs gained the ability to lead players to objectives and traverse worlds.</p>
<h2><b>Digital Characters in the Real World</b></h2>
<p>The technology used to create NPCs is also being used to animate avatars and digital humans. Going beyond gaming, task-specific generative AI is moving into healthcare, customer service and more.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Always Available, Real-Time Generative AI Healthcare Agents" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yg0m8eR7k24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA collaborated with Hippocratic AI at GTC to extend its healthcare agent solution, showcasing the potential of a generative AI healthcare agent avatar. More work underway to develop a super-low-latency inference platform to power real-time use cases.</p>
<p>“Our digital assistants provide helpful, timely and accurate information to patients worldwide,” said Munjal Shah, cofounder and CEO of Hippocratic AI. “NVIDIA ACE technologies bring them to life with cutting-edge visuals and realistic animations that help better connect to patients.”</p>
<p>Internal testing of Hippocratic’s initial AI healthcare agents is focused on chronic care management, wellness coaching, health risk assessments, social determinants of health surveys, pre-operative outreach and post-discharge follow-up.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sophie is a UneeQ digital human – and she&#039;s powered by Synanim and NVIDIA Audio2Face" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jK1Go1GVRLI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>UneeQ is an autonomous digital human platform focused on AI-powered avatars for customer service and interactive applications. UneeQ integrated the NVIDIA A2F microservice into its platform and combined it with its Synanim ML synthetic animation technology to create highly realistic avatars for enhanced customer experiences and engagement.</p>
<p>“UneeQ combines NVIDIA animation AI with our own Synanim ML synthetic animation technology to deliver real-time digital human interactions that are emotionally responsive and deliver dynamic experiences powered by conversational AI,” said Danny Tomsett, founder and CEO at UneeQ.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>From humble beginnings as a university spinoff to an acquisition by the leading global medtech company in its field, Odin Vision has been on an accelerated journey since its founding less than five years ago.</p>
<p>An alum of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/startups/?nvid=nv-int-tblg-295718-vt33">NVIDIA Inception</a> program for cutting-edge startups, Odin Vision builds cloud-connected AI software that helps clinicians detect and characterize areas of concern during endoscopy, a procedure where a tiny camera mounted on a tube is inserted into the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>Network-connected devices in the endoscopy room capture and stream real-time video data to the cloud, where powerful NVIDIA GPUs run AI inference. The models’ results are then streamed back to the endoscopy room so that clinicians can see the AI insights overlaid on the live video feed with minimal latency.</p>
<p>The startup was in 2022 acquired by Japanese medtech leader Olympus, which has a 70% global market share in gastrointestinal endoscopic equipment.</p>
<p>“We believe the acquisition brings us much closer to achieving our vision to revolutionize endoscopy through AI and cloud technology,” said Daniel Toth, cofounder and chief technology officer of Odin Vision. “Our software can reach Olympus’ global customer base, enabling us to bring our solutions to as many patients as possible.”</p>
<p>Olympus is also collaborating with NVIDIA on Olympus Office Hours, an advisory program that connects Inception startups with the medical device company’s experts, who will offer deep industry expertise and guidance to help the startups build AI solutions in key areas including gastroenterology, urology and surgery.</p>
<p>Eight leading AI startups have joined the inaugural cohort of the program — which is part of the NVIDIA Inception Alliance for Healthcare, an initiative that brings together medical AI startups with NVIDIA and its healthcare industry partners — to help accelerate their product development and go-to-market goals.</p>
<h2><b>An Extra Set of AIs for Clinicians</b></h2>
<p>Around <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ai-reduces-miss-rate-of-precancerous-polyps-in-colorectal-cancer-screening/#:~:text=The%20rate%20at%20which%20precancerous%20colorectal%20polyps%20is%20missed%20has,that%20had%20standard%20colonoscopy%20first." target="_blank" rel="noopener">a quarter of precancerous polyps are missed</a> during colonoscopies, a kind of endoscopy procedure that examines the lower digestive tract.</p>
<p>While some are missed because the endoscope doesn’t capture video footage of every angle, others remain undetected by clinicians. That’s where AI can help provide a second set of eyes to support clinical decision-making.</p>
<p>Seamless AI integration into the video feeds that medical professionals view during an endoscopy provides an extra data source that can help doctors detect and remove polyps sooner, helping prevent cancer development.</p>
<p>“Polyps develop slowly, and can take five or 10 years to appear as cancer,” Toth said. “If a clinician can detect and remove them in time, it can help save lives.”</p>
<p>CADDIE, the company’s AI software for detecting and classifying polyps, has received the CE Mark of regulatory approval in Europe and is deployed across hospitals in the U.K., Spain, Germany, Poland and Italy — with plans for use in the U.S as well.</p>
<p>Odin Vision also has AI software that has received the CE Mark to assist gastroscopy, where doctors inspect the esophagus for signs of throat cancer.</p>
<h2><b>Accelerated Inference for Real-Time Insights</b></h2>
<p>Odin Vision began as a research project by two professors and a Ph.D. student at University College London who were developing AI techniques for polyp detection. In 2019, they teamed with Toth and Odin’s CEO, Peter Mountney, both from Siemens Healthineers, to commercialize their work.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA GPUs were part of our work from the start — they’ve been essential to train our AI models and were part of our first product prototypes for inference, too,” Toth said. “Since moving to a cloud-based deployment, we’ve begun using the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server for dynamic processing in the cloud.”</p>
<p>The team uses <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/">NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs</a> for accelerated inference — most recently transitioning to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/l4/">NVIDIA L4 GPUs</a>. Adopting <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/triton-inference-server/">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a> software and the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt">NVIDIA TensorRT</a> software development kit enabled them to meet the low-latency threshold needed for real-time video-processing AI applications.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting doctors during specific procedures, Odin Vision plans to develop generative AI models that can automate a first draft of the clinical notes doctors prepare afterward — as well as models that can aggregate data across procedures. These would allow endoscopy teams to review analytics and assess how well a procedure is performed compared to clinical guidelines.</p>
<p>“Once you get to a point where there are dozens of AI models tracking different elements of these procedures, we can see if a healthcare professional is inspecting a particular area of the digestive tract for only three minutes, when it’s supposed to take six minutes,” Toth said. “The system can provide a nudge to remind the clinician to follow the guidelines.”</p>
<h2><b>Cloud-Connected Cancer Screening</b></h2>
<p>Membership in NVIDIA Inception provided the Odin Vision team access to technical expertise from NVIDIA and cloud credits through leading cloud service providers.</p>
<p>“Cloud credits helped us massively speed up our technology development and deployment, enabling us to release our products to market months earlier than initially planned,” Toth said. “NVIDIA experts also validated our product concept from a technology perspective and provided consultation about GPU and accelerated software optimizations.”</p>
<p>The team found that a cloud-based solution made it easier to push software updates over the air to deployments across hospital customers.</p>
<p>“Some AI companies are sending boxes that need to sit in clinical sites and require regular maintenance, which can prevent normal clinical workflows from running smoothly,” Toth said. “With network-connected devices, we can instead update a single server and the changes reach all end users at the same time.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>From designing dream cars to customizing clothing, 3D product configurators are ringing in a new era of hyper-personalization that will benefit retailers and consumers.</p>
<p>Developers are delivering innovative virtual product experiences and automated personalization using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description (aka OpenUSD)</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a> technologies from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs), and generative AI from <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/edify-3d-generative-ai-custom-fine-tuning/">NVIDIA Edify</a> models.</p>
<p>Together, these technologies enable developers to create configurator applications that deliver physically accurate, photoreal <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/">digital twins</a> of products, revolutionizing the way brands personalize buyer journeys at unprecedented scale.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://blog.3ds.com/brands/3dexcite/dassault-systemes-collaborates-with-nvidia-to-showcase-the-future-of-storytelling-with-generative-ai/">Dassault Systèmes’ 3DEXCITE</a> brand is adopting <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/omniverse-cloud-apis-industrial-digital-twin">Omniverse Cloud APIs</a> to enable interoperability with generative AI services, such as Shutterstock’s Edify3D or Edify 360, directly inside its web-based application.</p>
<p>By using NVIDIA Edify-powered models, trained by Shutterstock, Dassault Systèmes can generate stunning 3D environments from text prompts to instantly personalize scenes representing physically accurate products. And with Omniverse APIs, the company can supercharge the web-based app with real-time ray-traced rendering.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Future of Storytelling with Generative AI and NVIDIA" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h30brb7-taU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><a href="https://www.brickland.se/">Brickland</a>, another CGI studio, is developing real-time virtual experiences that allow users to customize clothing by choosing from predefined parameters such as color and material. Through their <a href="https://www.brickland.se/digitex/winter">Digitex initiative</a>, Brickland is expanding into digital textures and allowing consumers to visualize and interact with extreme levels of detail in their 3D assets thanks to RTX real-time rendering</p>
<p><a href="https://configit.com/">Configit</a> connected its powerful configurator logic tool Configit Ace to Omniverse and OpenUSD by streamlining the management of the complex rules system behind the creation of configurators and combining it with the rendering capabilities of Omniverse and RTX. This allows for rapid creation of articulated product configurators and enables the configurator developers to power real-time ray-traced rendering in their solutions.</p>
