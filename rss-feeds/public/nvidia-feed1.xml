<p><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</i> returns as a direct sequel to the record-breaking <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</i> and follows the story of Task Force 141 as they face off the ultimate threat.</p>
<p>Dig into the action-packed single-player campaign or head online to defeat the undead in an exciting open-world co-op experience that takes the Zombies mode that fans know and love to the next level. Those that prefer some multiplayer action can dip into a selection of Core Multiplayer maps from the 16 iconic launch maps of 2009’s <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</i> that are being brought over and modernized for <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</i>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Amazon Web Services and NVIDIA will bring the latest generative AI technologies to enterprises worldwide.</p>
<p>Combining AI and cloud computing, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang joined AWS CEO Adam Selipsky Tuesday on stage at AWS re:Invent 2023 at the Venetian Expo Center in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Selipsky said he was “thrilled” to announce the expansion of the partnership between AWS and NVIDIA with more offerings that will deliver advanced graphics, machine learning and generative AI infrastructure.</p>
<p>The two announced that AWS will be the first cloud provider to adopt the latest NVIDIA GH200 NVL32 Grace Hopper Superchip with new multi-node NVLink technology, that AWS is bringing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a> to AWS, and that AWS has integrated some of NVIDIA’s most popular software libraries.</p>
<p>Huang started the conversation by highlighting the integration of key NVIDIA libraries with AWS, encompassing a range from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> to <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuquantum-sdk">cuQuantum</a> to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/bionemo-on-aws-generative-ai-drug-discovery/">BioNeMo</a>, catering to domains like data processing, quantum computing and digital biology.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68437" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide1.png" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide1.png 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide1-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide1-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide1-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide1-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide1-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide1-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide1-1280x720.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>
<p>The partnership opens AWS to millions of developers and the nearly 40,000 companies who are using these libraries, Huang said, adding that it’s great to see AWS expand its cloud instance offerings to include NVIDIA’s new L4, L40S and, soon, H200 GPUs.</p>
<p>Selipsky then introduced the AWS debut of the NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, a significant advancement in cloud computing, and prompted Huang for further details.</p>
<p>“Grace Hopper, which is GH200, connects two revolutionary processors together in a really unique way,” Huang said. He explained that the GH200 connects NVIDIA’s Grace Arm CPU with its H200 GPU using a chip-to-chip interconnect called NVLink, at an astonishing one terabyte per second.</p>
<p>Each processor has direct access to the high-performance HBM and efficient LPDDR5X memory. This configuration results in 4 petaflops of processing power and 600GB of memory for each superchip.</p>
<p>AWS and NVIDIA connect 32 Grace Hopper Superchips in each rack using a new NVLink switch. Each 32 GH200 NVLink-connected node can be a single Amazon EC2 instance. When these are integrated with AWS Nitro and EFA networking, customers can connect GH200 NVL32 instances to scale to thousands of GH200 Superchips</p>
<p>“With AWS Nitro, that becomes basically one giant virtual GPU instance,” Huang said.</p>
<p>The combination of AWS expertise in highly scalable cloud computing plus NVIDIA innovation with Grace Hopper will make this an amazing platform that delivers the highest performance for complex generative AI workloads, Huang said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great to see the infrastructure, but it extends to the software, the services and all the other workflows that they have,&#8221; Selipsky said, introducing NVIDIA DGX Cloud on AWS.</p>
<p>This partnership will bring about the first DGX Cloud AI supercomputer powered by the GH200 Superchips, demonstrating the power of AWS’s cloud infrastructure and NVIDIA’s AI expertise.</p>
<p>Following up, Huang announced that this new DGX Cloud supercomputer design in AWS, codenamed Project Ceiba, will serve as NVIDIA’s newest AI supercomputer as well, for its own AI research and development.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68440" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide2.png" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide2.png 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide2-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide2-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide2-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide2-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide2-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide2-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Slide2-1280x720.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" /><br />
Named after the majestic Amazonian Ceiba tree, the Project Ceiba DGX Cloud cluster incorporates 16,384 GH200 Superchips to achieve 65 exaflops of AI processing power, Huang said.</p>
<p>Ceiba will be the world’s first GH200 NVL32 AI supercomputer built and the newest AI supercomputer in NVIDIA DGX Cloud, Huang said.</p>
<p>Huang described Project Ceiba AI supercomputer as “utterly incredible,” saying it will be able to reduce the training time of the largest language models by half.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s AI engineering teams will use this new supercomputer in DGX Cloud to advance AI for graphics, LLMs, image/video/3D generation, digital biology, robotics, self-driving cars, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/high-performance-computing/earth-2/">Earth-2 climate prediction</a> and more, Huang said.</p>
<p>“DGX is NVIDIA’s cloud AI factory,” Huang said, noting that AI is now key to doing NVIDIA’s own work in everything from computer graphics to creating digital biology models to robotics to climate simulation and modeling.</p>
<p>“DGX Cloud is also our AI factory to work with enterprise customers to build custom AI models,” Huang said. “They bring data and domain expertise; we bring AI technology and infrastructure.”</p>
<p>In addition, Huang also announced that AWS will be bringing four Amazon EC2 instances based on the NVIDIA GH200 NVL, H200, L40S, L4 GPUs, coming to market early next year.</p>
<p>Selipsky wrapped up the conversation by announcing that GH200-based instances and DGX Cloud will be available on AWS in the coming year.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Researchers and developers at leading pharmaceutical and techbio companies can now easily deploy <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/nvidia/hcls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Clara software and services</a> for accelerated healthcare through Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p><a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/aws-nvidia-strategic-collaboration-for-generative-ai">Announced today at AWS re:Invent</a>, the initiative gives healthcare and life sciences developers using AWS cloud resources the flexibility to integrate NVIDIA-accelerated offerings such as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/clara/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a> — a generative AI platform for drug discovery — coming to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a> on AWS, and currently available via the AWS ParallelCluster cluster management tool for high performance computing and the Amazon SageMaker machine learning service.</p>
<p>Thousands of healthcare and life sciences companies globally use AWS. They will now be able to access BioNeMo to build or customize digital biology foundation models with proprietary data, scaling up model training and deployment using NVIDIA GPU-accelerated cloud servers on AWS.</p>
<p>Techbio innovators including <a href="https://www.alchemab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alchemab Therapeutics</a>, <a href="https://www.basecamp-research.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basecamp Research</a>, <a href="https://www.characterbio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Character Biosciences</a>, <a href="https://www.evozyne.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evozyne</a>, <a href="https://www.etcembly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etcembly</a> and <a href="https://labgeni.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LabGenius</a> are among the AWS users already using BioNeMo for generative AI-accelerated drug discovery and development. This collaboration gives them more ways to rapidly scale up cloud computing resources for developing generative AI models trained on biomolecular data.</p>
<p>This announcement extends NVIDIA’s existing healthcare-focused offerings available on AWS — <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/monai/">NVIDIA MONAI</a> for medical imaging workflows and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/parabricks/">NVIDIA Parabricks</a> for accelerated genomics.</p>
<h2><b>New to AWS: NVIDIA BioNeMo Advances Generative AI for Drug Discovery</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/gpu-cloud/bionemo/">BioNeMo</a> is a domain-specific framework for digital biology generative AI, including pretrained large language models (LLMs), data loaders and optimized training recipes that can help advance computer-aided drug discovery by speeding target identification, protein structure prediction and drug candidate screening.</p>
<p>Drug discovery teams can use their proprietary data to build or optimize models with BioNeMo and run them on cloud-based high performance computing clusters.</p>
<p>One of these models, ESM-2 — a powerful LLM that supports protein structure prediction —  achieves almost linear scaling on 256 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. Researchers can scale to 512 H100 GPUs to complete training in a few days instead of a month, the training time published in the original paper.</p>
<p>Developers can train ESM-2 at scale using checkpoints of 650 million or 3 billion parameters. Additional AI models supported in the BioNeMo training framework include small-molecule generative model MegaMolBART and protein sequence generation model ProtT5.</p>
<p>BioNeMo’s pretrained models and optimized training recipes — which are available using self-managed services like AWS ParallelCluster and Amazon ECS as well as integrated, managed services through NVIDIA DGX Cloud and Amazon SageMaker — can help R&amp;D teams build foundation models that can explore more drug candidates, optimize wet lab experimentation and find promising clinical candidates faster.</p>
<h2><b>Also Available on AWS: NVIDIA Clara for Medical Imaging and Genomics</b></h2>
<p>Project MONAI, cofounded and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/monai/">enterprise-supported by NVIDIA</a> to support medical imaging workflows, has been downloaded more than 1.8 million times and is available for deployment on AWS. Developers can harness their proprietary healthcare datasets already stored on AWS cloud resources to rapidly annotate and build AI models for medical imaging.</p>
<p>These models, trained on NVIDIA GPU-powered <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon EC2 instances</a>, can be used for interactive annotation and fine-tuning for segmentation, classification, registration and detection tasks in medical imaging. Developers can also harness MRI image synthesis models available in MONAI to augment training datasets.</p>
<p>To accelerate genomics pipelines, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-apbngojlskcyq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parabricks</a> enables variant calling on a whole human genome in around 15 minutes, compared to a day on a CPU-only system. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/hpc/getting-started-with-nvidia-parabricks-on-aws-batch-using-aws-cloudformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On AWS</a>, developers can quickly scale up to process large amounts of genomic data across multiple GPU nodes.</p>
<p>More than a dozen <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/easily-run-nvidia-parabricks-ready2run-workflows-on-amazon-omics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parabricks workflows are available on</a> AWS HealthOmics as Ready2Run workflows, which enable customers to easily run pre-built pipelines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Developing more intelligent robots in the cloud is about to get a speed multiplier.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim">NVIDIA Isaac Sim</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/l40s/">NVIDIA L40S GPUs</a> are coming to Amazon Web Services, enabling developers to build and deploy accelerated robotics applications in the cloud. Isaac Sim, an extensible simulator for AI-enabled robots, is built on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> development platform for building and connecting <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">OpenUSD</a> applications.</p>
<p>Combining powerful AI compute with graphics and media acceleration, the L40S GPU is built to power the next generation of data center workloads. Based on the Ada Lovelace architecture, the L40S enables ultrafast real-time rendering delivering up to a 3.8x performance leap for Omniverse compared with the previous generation, boosting engineering and robotics teams.</p>
<p>The generational leap in acceleration results in 2x faster performance than the A40 GPU across a broad set of robotic simulations tasks when using Isaac Sim.</p>
<p>L40S GPUs can also be harnessed for generative AI workloads, from fine-tuning large language models within a matter of hours, to real-time inferencing for text-to-image and chat applications.</p>
<p>New Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) on the NVIDIA L40S in AWS Marketplace will enable roboticists to easily access preconfigured virtual machines to operate Isaac Sim workloads.</p>
<p>Robotics development in simulation is speeding the process of deploying applications, turbocharging industries such as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/isaac-jetson-robotics/">retail</a>, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/isaac-soft-robotics-simulation/">food processing</a>, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/bmw-group-nvidia-omniverse/">manufacturing</a>, logistics and more.</p>
<p>Revenue from mobile robots in warehouses worldwide is expected to explode, more than tripling from $11.6 billion in 2023 to $42.2 billion by 2030, according to ABI Research.</p>
<p>Robotics systems have played an important role across fulfillment centers to help meet the demands of online shoppers and provide a better workplace for employees. Amazon Robotics has deployed more than 750,000 robots in its warehouses around the world to improve the experience for employees supporting package fulfillment and its customers.</p>
<p>“Simulation technology plays a critical role in how we develop, test and deploy our robots.” said Brian Basile, head of virtual systems at Amazon Robotics. “At Amazon Robotics we continue to increase the scale and complexity of our simulations. With the new AWS L40S offering we will push the boundaries of simulation, rendering and model training even further.”</p>
<h2><b>Accelerated Robotics Development With Isaac Sim</b></h2>
<p>Robotics systems can demand large datasets for precision operation in deployed applications. Gathering these datasets and testing them in the real world is time-consuming, costly and impractical.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Everything about large language models is big — giant models train on massive datasets across thousands of NVIDIA GPUs.</p>
<p>That can pose a lot of big challenges for companies pursuing generative AI. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, a framework for building, customizing and running <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">LLMs</a>, helps overcome these challenges.</p>
<p>A team of experienced scientists and developers at Amazon Web Services creating <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/titan/">Amazon Titan</a> <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/">foundation models</a> for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/">Amazon Bedrock</a>, a generative AI service for foundation models, has been using NVIDIA NeMo for over the past several months.</p>
<p>“One key reason for us to work with NeMo is that it is extensible, comes with optimizations that allow us to run with high GPU utilization while also enabling us to scale to larger clusters so we can train and deliver models to our customers faster,” said Leonard Lausen, a senior applied scientist at AWS.</p>
<p style="margin: 12.0pt 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><b>Think Big, Really Big</b></p>
<p>Parallelism techniques in NeMo enable efficient LLM training at scale. When coupled with the Elastic Fabric Adapter from AWS, it allowed the team to spread its LLM across many GPUs to accelerate training.</p>
<p>EFA provides AWS customers with an UltraCluster Networking infrastructure that can directly connect more than 10,000 GPUs and bypass the operating system and CPU using <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect">NVIDIA GPUDirect</a>.</p>
<p>The combination allowed the AWS scientists to deliver excellent model quality — something that’s not possible at scale when relying solely on data parallelism approaches.</p>
<h2><b>Framework Fits All Sizes</b></h2>
<p>“The flexibility of NeMo,” Lausen said, “allowed AWS to tailor the training software for the specifics of the new Titan model, datasets and infrastructure.”</p>
<p>AWS’s innovations include efficient streaming from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to the GPU cluster. “It was easy to incorporate these improvements because NeMo builds upon popular libraries like PyTorch Lightning that standardize LLM training pipeline components,” Lausen said.</p>
<p>AWS and NVIDIA aim to infuse products like NVIDIA NeMo and services like Amazon Titan with lessons learned from their collaboration for the benefit of customers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This week’s talented In the NVIDIA Studio artist, Nourhan Ismail, created a literal NVIDIA studio.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of our weekly </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/in-the-nvidia-studio/"><i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/"><i>NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> technology improves creative workflows. </i></p>
<p>This week’s talented <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i> artist, Nourhan Ismail, created a literal NVIDIA studio.</p>
<p>Her piece, called <i>Creator by Day, Gamer by Night</i>, was crafted with the isometric art style and impressive graphical fidelity Ismail’s known for, rich with vibrant colors and playful details. It also captures her “work hard, play hard” mentality as a 3D artist, interior designer and game level designer.</p>
<p>The same art style is featured in the NVIDIA Studio Sessions YouTube miniseries led by Ismail, which provides step-by-step tutorials on how to create a low-poly bedroom, from inception to final render.</p>

<h2><b>Turning Pain Into Beauty</b></h2>
<p>Ismail’s creative journey began at age four as a form of escape from the armed conflict occurring in Syria, her homeland. During that time, Ismail’s family faced many difficulties, including the loss of their home.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, she looked to her father, an accomplished artist and fashion designer, as a source of inspiration.</p>
<p>“His encouragement propelled me to showcase the pinnacle of my abilities, reminding me that art has the power to transform pain into beauty,” she said.</p>
<p>That encouragement has guided and fueled Ismail’s creative journey, eventually giving rise to her signature, single-room isometric style, an homage to the power of resilience and finding beauty in adversity.</p>

<p>“Starting with a single room, I delve into interior design, crafting spaces that reflect the comfort and joy I yearned for during challenging times,” she said. “To me, overcoming adversity proves that even from the harshest circumstances, beauty can emerge.”</p>
<p>Ismail started as a self-taught 3D artist, driven by a passion to learn the intricacies of creating digital masterpieces.</p>
<p>“Posting my works became a personal gauge of improvement — not for validation, but as a record of my learning curve,” she said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68404" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68404" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-bathroom-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68404" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-bathroom-1280w-500x500.png" alt="" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-bathroom-1280w-500x500.png 500w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-bathroom-1280w-400x400.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-bathroom-1280w-150x150.png 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-bathroom-1280w-768x768.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-bathroom-1280w-450x450.png 450w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-bathroom-1280w-215x215.png 215w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-bathroom-1280w-100x100.png 100w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-bathroom-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68404" class="wp-caption-text">Beautifully conceived, masterfully executed.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Each of Ismail’s pieces is a testament to her evolving skills, dedication and love for sharing her craft, especially with her father.</p>
<p>In fact, she dedicated her first isometric house to her father. “That was the happiest moment, to create something inspiring and make someone happy,” she said.</p>
<h2><b>Isometric Art</b></h2>
<p>Ismail first collects reference material on Adobe Behance to gain inspiration on ways to mix different art styles.</p>
<p>She then opens Blender and starts sketching in 3D. Blender Cycles’ RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing, powered by her <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3080-3080ti/">GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU</a>, ensured smooth viewport movement.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68422" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68422" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-light-mode-1280w-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-68422 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-light-mode-1280w-672x378.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-light-mode-1280w-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-light-mode-1280w-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-light-mode-1280w-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-light-mode-1280w-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-light-mode-1280w-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-light-mode-1280w-800x450.jpg 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-light-mode-1280w-382x215.jpg 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-light-mode-1280w-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-light-mode-1280w-1280x720.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68422" class="wp-caption-text">A gorgeous work in progress.</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the models are still fairly rudimentary, Ismail calculates the angles that light should be coming in from.</p>
<p>“Lighting is an emotional element,” she said. “The lighting of each piece evokes different emotions and a certain idiosyncratic introspectiveness, making the experience unique to each person.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_68407" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68407" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-studio-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68407" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-studio-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-studio-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-studio-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-studio-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-studio-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-studio-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-studio-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-studio-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68407" class="wp-caption-text">The NVIDIA Studio has NVIDIA Canvas!</figcaption></figure>
<p>Her trick is to regularly switch between rich, colorful scenes and plain color models to measure the emotional weight and visual impact. She either creates the custom textures herself or downloads premade ones online when on a time crunch.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68410" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-desk-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68410" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-desk-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-desk-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-desk-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-desk-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-desk-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-desk-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-desk-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-desk-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68410" class="wp-caption-text">Ismail’s incredible detail on full display.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, she plays with camera angles to analyze depth shadows and lighting, setting up animations and sequence shots in Blender. There, Blender Cycles’ RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing delivered seamless viewport movement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA today launched a cloud service for medical imaging AI to further streamline and accelerate the creation of ground-truth data and training of specialized AI models through fully managed, cloud-based application programming interfaces.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/monai/">NVIDIA MONAI</a> cloud APIs — announced at the annual meeting of RSNA, the Radiological Society of North America, taking place this week in Chicago — provide an expedited path for developers and platform providers to integrate AI into their medical imaging offerings using pretrained foundation models and AI workflows for enterprises. The APIs are built on the open-source MONAI project founded by NVIDIA and King’s College London.</p>
<p>Medical imaging is critical across healthcare, making up approximately <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09104.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90% of healthcare data</a>. It’s used by radiologists and clinicians to do screening, diagnosis and intervention, by biopharma researchers to evaluate how clinical trial patients respond to new drugs and by medical device makers to provide real-time decision support.</p>
<p>The scale of work across each of these areas requires a medical imaging-specific AI factory — an enterprise-grade platform that delivers large-scale data management, creates ground-truth annotations, accelerates model development and establishes seamless AI application deployment.</p>
<p>With NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs, solution providers can more easily integrate AI into their medical imaging platforms, enabling them to provide supercharged tools for radiologists, researchers and clinical trial teams to build domain-specialized AI factories. The APIs are <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-monai-cloud-api-early-access-program">available in early access</a> through the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a> AI supercomputing service.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA MONAI cloud API is integrated into Flywheel, a leading medical imaging data and AI platform that supports end-to-end workflows for AI development. Developers at medical image annotation companies including <a href="https://redbrickai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RedBrick AI</a> and at machine learning operations (MLOps) platform providers including <a href="https://www.dataiku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dataiku</a> are poised to integrate NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs into their offerings.</p>
<h2><b>Easy-to-Deploy Annotation and Training for Medical Imaging</b></h2>
<p>Building efficient and cost-effective AI solutions requires a robust, domain-specialized development foundation that includes full-stack optimizations for software, scalable multi-node systems and state-of-the-art research. It also requires high-quality ground-truth data — which can be arduous and time-consuming to gather, particularly for 3D medical images that require a high level of expertise to annotate.</p>
<p>NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs feature interactive annotation powered by the VISTA-3D (Vision Imaging Segmentation and Annotation) foundation model. It’s purpose-built for continuous learning, a capability that improves AI model performance based on user feedback and new data.</p>
<p>Trained on a dataset of annotated images from 3D CT scans from more than 4,000 patients, spanning various diseases and parts of the body, VISTA-3D accelerates the creation of 3D segmentation masks for medical image analysis. With continuous learning, the AI model’s annotation quality improves over time.</p>
<p>To further accelerate AI training, this release includes APIs that make it seamless to build custom models based on MONAI pretrained models. NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs also include Auto3DSeg, which automates hyperparameter tuning and AI model selection for a given 3D segmentation task, simplifying the model development process.</p>
<p>NVIDIA researchers recently won four challenges at the MICCAI medical imaging conference using Auto3DSeg. These included AI models to analyze 3D CT scans of the kidneys and heart, brain MRIs and 3D ultrasounds of the heart.</p>
<h2><b>Solutions Providers, Platform Builders Embrace NVIDIA MONAI Cloud APIs</b></h2>
<p>Medical imaging solution providers and machine learning platforms are using NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs to deliver critically valuable AI insights to accelerate their customers’ work.</p>
<p>Flywheel has integrated MONAI through <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> and is now offering NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs to accelerate medical image curation, labeling analysis and training. The Minneapolis-based company’s centralized, cloud-based platform powers biopharma companies, life science organizations, healthcare providers and academic medical centers to identify, curate and train medical imaging data for the development of trustworthy AI.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs lower the cost of building high-quality AI models for radiology, disease research and the evaluation of clinical trial data,” said Dan Marcus, chief scientific officer at Flywheel. “With the addition of cloud APIs for interactive annotation and automated segmentation, customers of our medical imaging AI platform can accelerate AI model development to more quickly deliver innovative solutions.”</p>
<p>Annotation and viewer solution providers, including Redbrick AI, <a href="https://radicalimaging.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radical Imaging</a>, <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">V7 Labs</a> and <a href="https://centaurlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centaur Labs</a>, will also use NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs to bring AI-assisted annotation and training capabilities to market faster, without having to host and manage the AI infrastructure on their own.</p>
<p>RedBrick AI is integrating the VISTA-3D model available through NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs to deliver interactive cloud annotation for its medical device customers that support distributed teams of clinicians.</p>
<p>“VISTA-3D allows our clients to rapidly build models across different modalities and conditions,” said Shivam Sharma, CEO of RedBrick AI. “The foundation model is generalizable, making it easy to fine-tune for various clinical applications with accurate, reliable segmentation results.”</p>
<p>To streamline enterprise AI model development, MLOps platform builders including Dataiku, ClearML and Weight &amp; Biases are also investigating the use of NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs.</p>
<p>Dataiku plans to integrate NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs to further simplify AI model creation for medical imaging applications.</p>
<p>“With NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs, Dataiku users would be able to easily use Auto3DSeg, a low-code option to accelerate the development of state-of-the-art segmentation models, through Dataiku’s web interface connected to an NVIDIA-hosted, GPU-accelerated service,” said Kelci Miclaus, global head of AI health and life sciences solutions at Dataiku. “This democratizes AI in biomedical imaging by extending the power to create and apply AI-driven workflows to both data and domain experts.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>A calendar packed with meetings, calls and lab visits may sound like a typical workday for many — but for Luca Lofranco, whose greatest wish was to experience what it’s like to work at NVIDIA, it was a dream come true.</p>
<p>Eighteen-year-old Lofranco recently traveled from his hometown near Toronto, Canada, to spend the day at our Santa Clara campus, supported by Make-A-Wish, a nonprofit that grants life-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses. The wish from Lofranco, who has Hodgkin’s lymphoma, was the fifth NVIDIA has been a part of in the last decade.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA team kept the day’s agenda a secret — surprising Lofranco with tours of the demo room and robotics lab, a chat with the University Recruiting team, a ride in a self-driving car and a video call with NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. An aspiring computer science major, Lofranco was stoked for it all because, as his mom Cassandra shared, “NVIDIA is his Disneyland.”</p>

<h2><b>A Long-Time NVIDIA Fan </b></h2>
<p>After attending his first computer science summer camp when he was eight, Lofranco learned 3D modeling in Autodesk Maya, programming in Python, as well as 3D printing. His budding interest in tech grew and, soon enough, he was building his own gaming rigs.</p>
<p>NVIDIA quickly became Lofranco’s favorite tech company, he said, so much so that he carved the company logo out of a piece of wood using a computer numerical control machine.</p>
<p>For gaming, he enjoys using NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 and GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPUs. But Lofranco’s ultimate draw to NVIDIA wasn’t its products but its culture.</p>
<p>“Everyone is driven to see the same outcome and comes together to make it happen,” he said. “Everything is designed for collaboration.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_68324" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68324" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-68324 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-672x409.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="409" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-672x409.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-400x244.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-768x468.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-1536x935.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-739x450.jpg 739w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-353x215.jpg 353w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-164x100.jpg 164w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-1280x779.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68324" class="wp-caption-text">Lofranco in NVIDIA gear</figcaption></figure>
<h2><b>A VIP Experience</b></h2>
<p>Ahead of Lofranco’s visit, the NVIDIA team sent him a box of swag — including a hoodie, a hat and a custom NVIDIA badge.</p>
<p>Once he arrived on campus, NVIDIA volunteers welcomed and whisked Lofranco off on a campus tour, followed by a meeting with the solutions architect team, which includes NVIDIANs focused on healthcare, auto, AI, cloud service providers and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/">large language models</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68327 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-667x500.jpg" alt="" width="667" height="500" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-667x500.jpg 667w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-400x300.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-600x450.jpg 600w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-287x215.jpg 287w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-133x100.jpg 133w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p>Next, a visit to the robotics lab helped satisfy Lofranco’s “maker” curiosity. He saw an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/data-center/dgx-platform/">NVIDIA DGX Station</a> as well as test robots for developing the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a> edge AI platform, and was soon directing a robot arm to stack colored blocks.</p>
<p>After learning that Lofranco’s favorite foods include lobster, tiramisu and Kit Kat candy bars, the café team prepared a special menu for him and all employees in the office that day. Everyone enjoyed a lobster roll pop-up station in the campus park and tiramisu-flavored ice cream with assorted toppings, including Kit Kat pieces.</p>

<h2><b>Innovators</b></h2>
<p>On a visit to the demo room at NVIDIA’s Santa Clara site, Lofranco and his father revealed that they tinker with innovations themselves. They programmed their water heater in the family hot tub to maintain a comfortable temperature and decrease the time needed to warm it — all thanks to Python code and Raspberry Pi experimentation.</p>
<p>With so much to soak in, Lofranco described his wish day at NVIDIA as “unfathomable” — and that was before his video call with Huang, which stretched from a planned quarter hour to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>After a conversation that spanned NVIDIA’s origins, many near failures and innovation, Huang gifted Lofranco a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/">GeForce RTX 4090</a> Founders Edition GPU and shared some sound advice: “Keep playing video games — but make sure to prioritize your homework.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_68333" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68333" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-68333 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-672x448.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="448" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-672x448.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-400x267.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-675x450.jpg 675w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-322x215.jpg 322w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-1280x854.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68333" class="wp-caption-text">Lofranco with the surprise gift from Huang following their chat</figcaption></figure>
<p>Capping a packed day of fun-filled support from nearly 50 NVIDIANs was a visit to the auto lab and a spin in one of NVIDIA’s self-driving test cars.</p>
<p>How was it all? “Breathtaking,” said Lofranco, who learned firsthand from Huang that while NVIDIA has evolved from being the underdog to a leading tech company, it still feels “like a family.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Talk about going after low-hanging fruit. Afresh is an AI startup that helps grocery stores and retailers reduce food waste by making supply chains more efficient.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of NVIDIA’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/ai-podcast/">AI Podcast</a>, host Noah Kravitz spoke with the company’s cofounder and president, Nathan Fenner, about its mission, offerings and the greater challenge of eliminating food waste.</p>
<p>Most supply chain and inventory management offerings targeting grocers and retailers are outdated. Fenner and his team noticed those solutions, built for the nonperishable side of the business, didn’t work as well on the fresh side — creating enormous amounts of food waste and causing billions in lost profits.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1671268662%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-75QpZNVnAWT&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc; line-break: anywhere; word-break: normal; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif; font-weight: 100;"><a style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" title="The AI Podcast" href="https://soundcloud.com/theaipodcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The AI Podcast</a> · <a style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" title="AI-Powered Tech Company Helps Grocers Start Afresh in Supply Chain Management" href="https://soundcloud.com/theaipodcast/nathan-fenner-afresh/s-75QpZNVnAWT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI-Powered Tech Company Helps Grocers Start Afresh in Supply Chain Management</a></div>
<p>The team first sought to solve the store-replenishment challenge by developing a platform to help grocers decide how much fresh produce to order to optimize costs while meeting demand.</p>
<p>They created machine learning and AI models that could effectively use the data generated by fresh produce, which is messier than data generated by nonperishable goods because of factors like time to decay, greater demand fluctuation and unreliability caused by lack of barcodes, leading to incorrect scans at self-checkout registers.</p>
<p>The result was a fully integrated, machine learning-based platform that helps grocers make informed decisions at each node of the operations process.</p>
<p>The company also recently launched inventory management software that allows grocers to save time and increase data accuracy by intelligently tracking inventory. That information can be inputted back into the platform’s ordering solution, further refining the accuracy of inventory data.</p>
<p>It’s all part of Afresh’s greater mission to tackle climate change.</p>
<p>“The most impactful thing we can do is reduce food waste to mitigate climate change,” Fenner said. “It’s really one of the key things that brought me into the business: I think I’ve always had a keen eye to work in the climate space. It’s really motivating for a lot of our team, and it’s a key part of our mission.”</p>

<p>The collaboration will initially focus on optimizing Genentech’s drug discovery AI models in its “lab in a loop” framework. The goal: To allow its researchers to understand complex biomolecular patterns and relationships to truly disrupt drug development and improve the success rate of R&amp;D, and to empower scientists to deliver multiplicative, rather than linear or additive, benefits for patients and the broader healthcare ecosystem.</p>
<p>“Our collaboration with NVIDIA builds on our long history of successfully inventing and deploying technology in ways that were not initially apparent to others,” said Aviv Regev, executive vice president and head of Genentech Research &amp; Early Development (gRED). “We were the first biotech company to leverage molecular biology for drug discovery and development, which changed the world. We pioneered antibody therapeutics that became the paradigm of treatment. And now, we have brought AI, the lab and the clinic together to uncover otherwise inaccessible patterns in vast quantities of data, and to design experiments to test those patterns. Collaborating with NVIDIA, and introducing generative AI, has the power to turbocharge the discovery and design of therapeutics that will improve the lives of patients across the world.”</p>

<h2><b>Streamlining Drug Discovery With Computation  </b></h2>
<p>Drug discovery and development is currently a lengthy, complicated and costly process. Drug targets for novel medicines are difficult to predict, as is successfully developing a molecule as a potential therapeutic. AI can play a transformational role because generative and other AI models can help scientists rapidly identify potential drug molecules and interactions by training on large-scale datasets.</p>
<p>For Genentech, using AI helps bridge the gap between lab experiments and computational algorithms.</p>
<p>The company’s R&amp;D group, gRED, has already done significant work using AI — across multiple modalities — to discover and develop novel therapeutics while learning more about the building blocks of biology and diseases.</p>
<p>Teams from Genentech and NVIDIA will now work together to optimize Genentech’s custom-developed models to shorten this time-consuming process of drug discovery and development and lead to greater success.</p>
<h2><b>Putting AI in a Loop</b></h2>
<p>Genentech’s “lab in a loop” is an iterative framework for generating and exploring molecular designs with predicted properties. It aims to use experimental data to inform generative computational models and better optimize future molecular designs. NVIDIA will help Genentech optimize its framework by accelerating training and inference of Genentech’s drug discovery models.</p>
<p>Through this collaboration, NVIDIA AI experts will gain insights into AI-related challenges in drug discovery and development. NVIDIA plans to use these insights to improve its BioNeMo platform and others to further accommodate the requirements of models used by the biotech industry.</p>
<p>“AI can play a transformational role in accelerating drug discovery and development — as it has across many parts of healthcare and life sciences,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. “Together, NVIDIA and Genentech are unlocking scientific innovation by developing and implementing AI models and algorithms that enable us to rapidly iterate and unearth insights.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of our weekly </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/in-the-nvidia-studio/"><i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/"><i>NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> technology improves creative workflows. </i></p>
<p>It’s the season of gratitude: that time of year to give thanks for the people and small moments that make life so special.</p>
<p>This week’s featured <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i> artist, Ravissen Carpenen, is serving up a feast of mouthwateringly photorealistic 3D food renders to the dinner table.</p>
<p>His delectable time-lapse videos are featured on his YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Vs9hDHCD1pD85uCehjlAg">CG Realism</a> — presented with a side of upbeat music and a pinch of style.</p>
<p>Carpenen was one of several contributors to the food-themed Studio Standout video contest, alongside Roger Roque (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbFhGU0p5aEVnT2VHSU5IaHhuWDB3YURySWhtQXxBQ3Jtc0tsT196Ui14MWhNeHpTTmRzX2pNTFRWdlRld1VOVDNVaTQzbTljUV9xV1lWWXZDcW5kMVctcC1wWW9PVkloNjVpMXBLTHloUHVIa1FIZzZvNmZPbkdXWV9YVVFBUXExYXBWNU5yS0Y0aUNCeWFKREw5RQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Frogerroqueid%2F&amp;v=P1BIBbjntsM">@rogerroqueid</a>), Nicole Morena (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbmtuWHZKam1CUHB1VUd3aHBBZzRwZnhRTHZrQXxBQ3Jtc0tuX1NHQ3ZwZGpVcVZiS1RfMjRzR3VBd3Z5OTZIWnJPOVVKcS1UWTBLUFBtcENxYmdURy1QcjUzNU92aEFlMTJlZExuNjJINzBOaDJsNXZOLVB6cWt3OGpjRlNaQUZ5eDZHSnVxQjVjbEJUeXp1N0RyWQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fnicky.blender%2F&amp;v=P1BIBbjntsM">@nicky.blender</a>), Heloise Cart (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0l4ajNyVDBqV0Fta0xOOGhmXzZyNXJaM204Z3xBQ3Jtc0tsdUl4ZW5pZEdNMTUtblhkdW5QcjZpOTZvQkszMGVDdWlGM3Jva2p1eTlERkw5V0p2VjJBREVaSkRJVS1DQ1dWZ1o5Z0JyM3NZbFotUUFnRV9iYjZqYlhXR29zX0F5b3VQUHhJdzdQM25WQ1M0S2EzSQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fisoheell%2F&amp;v=P1BIBbjntsM">@isoheell</a>) and Kris Theroin (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbnRlYnpmR2pIY0pXQXp4Q2hieERxZm90dldyUXxBQ3Jtc0ttODhUdFRJRkJUOUVxRzE5SHE4cGM4dTVRa1FCX1JhYktoaUp6NGxwdE55QWc0MEpyQUdzbVFIN2lMX215WEdacEZ3OUphRDVJSkdpMmNjZlNGT3JEMC12MGJwZ3lyR0ptSFFOUXVOQ016M2NCbHlBYw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fkristheorin%2F&amp;v=P1BIBbjntsM">@kristheorin</a>).</p>

<h2><b>All About That Baste</b></h2>
<p>Carpenen’s wife, a pastry chef, inspired his photorealistic, food-centered works.</p>
<p>“My aim, one day, is to be able to create ultra-realistic renders that will be used in film and movies,” he said.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Happy Meal - Blender Timelapse" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vwA5CaYVPQQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>His projects begin with online research and reference gathering, mainly on Pinterest and Behance, which he then compiles into mood boards using the stand-alone image tracking program PureRef.</p>
<p>Before any modeling takes place, Carpenen lights the scene — but without textures.</p>
<p>“This is to tell the story of the artwork, as light intends to give artwork an emotional flow, alongside as well as color and materials,” he said.</p>
<p>Carpenen initially sculpts his models in ZBrush using customizable brushes to shape, texture and paint his virtual clay in a real-time environment with instant feedback.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68261-2" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Turkey-Blender-Timelapse-video.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Turkey-Blender-Timelapse-video.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Turkey-Blender-Timelapse-video.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He then browses the Quixel Megascans library for models that can further add realism, such as garlic cloves and rosemary garnishes for his turkey project.</p>
<h2><b>Rare-in for More</b></h2>
<p>Carpenen uses Marmoset Toolbag’s ambient occlusion, curvature, normal and thickness features to bake the ZBrush meshes from high-poly to low-poly models as 32-bit textures.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Medium Cooked Steak - 3D Timelapse" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c2NOK9eDRDA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The process saves memory space, minimizing lag time while allowing greater flexibility in the modeling stage.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68271" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68271" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w-672x372.png" alt="" width="672" height="372" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w-672x372.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w-400x221.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w-768x425.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w-814x450.png 814w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w-389x215.png 389w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w-181x100.png 181w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68271" class="wp-caption-text">Bake ZBrush meshes from high-poly to low-poly models as 32-bit textures in Marmoset Toolbag.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Carpenen’s GeForce RTX 3070 GPU-powered system with RTX acceleration instantly optimized his meshes. RTX-accelerated ray tracing and OptiX AI-powered denoising also enabled smoother viewport movement.</p>
<h2><b>Baking a Berry Good Pie</b></h2>
<p>Once the renders are ready, Carpenen imports them into Adobe Substance 3D Painter to apply custom colors and textures.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Blackberry Pie - Blender Timelapse" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xPA6-ZW293Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>There, Carpenen uses RTX-accelerated light and ambient occlusion baking — though not in the oven — to optimize his assets, such as this berry pie, in mere seconds.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68261-3" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Blackberry-Pie-Blender-Timelapse-video.mp4?_=3" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Blackberry-Pie-Blender-Timelapse-video.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Blackberry-Pie-Blender-Timelapse-video.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also had the option to set up a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/ecosystem/">live link</a> connection between 3D Painter and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/creators/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a development platform for connecting and building <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)</a>-based tools and applications, via the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/usd-composer/">USD Composer foundation app</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Adobe Substance 3D Painter Connector Overview with Omniverse USD Composer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_XRN2qAWJN0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The connection would allow Carpenen’s texture work in Substance 3D Painter to directly translate to USD Composer — eliminating the need for numerous file imports, exports and reformatting.</p>
<h2><b>Donut Hole in One</b></h2>
<p>Carpenen uses Blender to bring his scenes together with advanced model sculpting, animations and further lighting refinement.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Donut Fever - Blender Timelapse" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LESrdWIZgv0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>RTX GPUs allow smoother movement in the viewport thanks to Blender Cycles’ RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing.</p>

<p>And for exporting final files, RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in Blender Cycles delivers the fastest final-frame render.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68280" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68280" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68280" class="wp-caption-text">It doesn’t get any sweeter than this.</figcaption></figure>
<h2><b>Thanks to AI, This Work Is Toast</b></h2>
<p>Carpenen uses Adobe Photoshop Lightroom to put the finishing touches on his food scenes.</p>
<p>GPU-accelerated image processing enables dramatically more responsive adjustments on his 4K-resolution display.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Blender 2.92 - Toasty Morning" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHmrGJhm8-4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Carpenen had even more RTX-accelerated AI tools at his disposal in Lightroom. The “Raw Details” feature refines the fine color details of high-resolution RAW images. And “Super Resolution” uses AI to upscale images with higher quality than traditional methods.</p>
<p>According to Carpenen, putting in the work is key.</p>
<p>“It’s equivalent to practicing football — if you don’t get enough time daily to practice, you can’t hone skills,” he said. “It’s important to know how to tackle obstacles — and that knowledge can only be gained by experience.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>European startups will get a massive boost from a new generation of AI infrastructure, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said Friday in a fireside chat with iliad Group Deputy CEO Aude Durand — and it’s coming just in time.</p>
<p>“We’re now seeing a major second wave,” Huang said of the state of AI during a virtual appearance at Scaleway’s ai-PULSE conference in Paris for an audience of more than 1,000 in-person attendees.</p>
<p>Two elements are propelling this force, Huang explained in a conversation livestreamed from Station F, the world’s largest startup campus, which Huang joined via video conference from NVIDIA’s headquarters in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>First, “a recognition that every region and every country needs to build their sovereign AI,” Huang said. Second, the “adoption of AI in different industries,” as generative AI spreads throughout the world, Huang explained.</p>
<p>“So the types of breakthroughs that we’re seeing in language I fully expect to see in digital biology and manufacturing and robotics,” Huang said, noting this could create big opportunities for Europe with its rich digital biology and healthcare industries. “And of course, Europe is also home of some of the largest industrial manufacturing companies.”</p>
<h2><b>Praise for France’s AI Leadership</b></h2>
<p>Durand kicked off the conversation by asking Huang about his views on the European AI ecosystem, especially in France, where the government has invested millions of euros in AI research and development.</p>
<p>“Europe has always been rich in AI expertise,” Huang said, noting that NVIDIA works with 4,000 startups in Europe, more than 400 of them in France alone, pointing to Mistral, Qubit Pharmaceuticals and Poolside AI.</p>
<p>“At the same time, you have to really get the computing infrastructure going,” Huang said. “And this is the reason why Scaleway is so important to the advancement of AI in France” and throughout Europe, Huang said.</p>
<p>Highlighting the critical role of data in AI’s regional growth, Huang noted companies’ increasing awareness of the value of training AI with region-specific data. AI systems need to reflect the unique cultural and industrial nuances of each region, an approach gaining traction across Europe and beyond.</p>
<h2>NVIDIA and Scaleway: Powering Europe’s AI Revolution</h2>
<p>Scaleway, a subsidiary of iliad Group, a major European telecoms player, is doing its part to kick-start that second wave in Europe, offering cloud credits for access to its AI supercomputer cluster, which packs 1,016 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>.</p>
<p>As a regional cloud service provider, Scaleway also provides sovereign infrastructure that ensures access and compliance with EU data protection laws, which is critical for businesses with a European footprint.</p>
<p>Regional members of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception program</a>, which provides development assistance to startups, will also be able to access <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/scaleway-european-startups-inception">NVIDIA AI Enterprise software on Scaleway Marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>The software includes the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a> framework and pretrained models for building LLMs, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rapids">NVIDIA RAPIDS</a> for accelerated data science and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a> and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-supercharges-large-language-model-inference-on-nvidia-h100-gpus/">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a> for boosting inference.</p>
<h2>Revolutionizing AI With Supercomputing Prowess</h2>
<p>Recapping a month packed with announcements, Huang explained how NVIDIA is rapidly advancing high performance computing and AI worldwide to provide the infrastructure needed to power this second wave.</p>
<p>These systems are, in effect,  “supercomputers,” Huang said, with AI systems now among the world’s most powerful.</p>
<p>They include Scaleway’s newly available <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/news/scaleway-releases-the-details-of-its-offering-based-on-nabuchodonosor-its-dedicated-ai-supercomputer-built-on-nvidia-dgx-h100-infrastructure/">Nabuchodonosor</a> supercomputer, or “Nabu,” an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD</a> with 127 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-h100/?ncid=pa-srch-goog-560181&amp;_bt=676835775117&amp;_bk=dgx%20h100&amp;_bm=p&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=154931763096&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0NPi36mVggMV80lHAR0zigLiEAAYASAAEgJCF_D_BwE">NVIDIA DGX H100</a> systems, which will help startups in France and across Europe scale up AI workloads.</p>
<p>“As you know the Scaleway system that we brought online, Nabu, is not your normal computer,” Huang said. “In every single way, it’s a supercomputer.”</p>
<p>Such systems are underpinning powerful new services.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-introduces-generative-ai-foundry-service-on-microsoft-azure-for-enterprises-and-startups-worldwide">NVIDIA announced an AI Foundry service</a> on Microsoft Azure, aimed at accelerating the development of customized generative AI applications.</p>
<p>Huang highlighted NVIDIA AI foundry’s appeal to a diverse user base, including established enterprises such as Amdocs, Getty Images, SAP and ServiceNow.</p>
<p><a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-grace-hopper-superchip-powers-jupiter-defining-a-new-class-of-supercomputers-to-propel-ai-for-scientific-discovery">Huang noted that JUPITER, to be hosted at the Jülich facility, in Germany</a>, and poised to be Europe’s premier exascale AI supercomputer, will run on 24,000 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips, offering unparalleled computational capacity for diverse AI tasks and simulations.</p>
<p>Huang touched on NVIDIA’s just-announced HGX H200 AI computing platform, built on NVIDIA’s Hopper architecture and featuring the H200 Tensor Core GPU. Set for release in Q2 of 2024, it promises to redefine industry standards.</p>
<p>He also detailed NVIDIA’s strategy to develop ‘AI factories,’ advanced data centers that power diverse applications across industries, including electric vehicles, robotics, and generative AI services.</p>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>Finally, Durand asked Huang about the role of open source and open science in AI.</p>
<p>Huang said he’s a “huge fan” of open source. “Let’s acknowledge that without open source, how would AI have made the tremendous progress it has over the last decade,” Huang said.</p>
<p>“And so the ability for open source to energize the vibrancy and pull in the research and pull in the engagement of every startup, every researcher, every industry is really quite vital,” Huang said. “And you’re seeing it play out just presently, now going forward.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>How do you train an AI to understand clinical language with less clinical data? Train another AI to synthesize training data.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is changing the way medicine is done, and is increasingly being used in all sorts of clinical tasks.</p>
<p>This is fueled by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> and models like GatorTronGPT, a generative language model trained on the University of Florida’s HiPerGator AI supercomputer and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-023-00958-w">detailed in a paper published in Nature Digital Medicine Thursday</a>.</p>
<p>GatorTronGPT joins a growing number of large language models (<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/">LLMs</a>) trained on clinical data. Researchers trained the model using the GPT-3 framework, also used by ChatGPT.</p>
<p>They used a massive corpus of 277 billion words for this purpose. The training corpora included 82 billion words from de-identified clinical notes and 195 billion words from various English texts.</p>
<p>But there’s a twist: The research team also used GatorTronGPT to generate a synthetic clinical text corpus with over 20 billion words of synthetic clinical text, with carefully prepared prompts. The synthetic clinical text focuses on clinical factors and reads just like real clinical notes written by doctors.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/">synthetic data</a> was then used to train a BERT-based model called GatorTron-S.</p>
<p>In a comparative evaluation, GatorTron-S exhibited remarkable performance on clinical natural language understanding tasks like clinical concept extraction and medical relation extraction, beating the records set by the original BERT-based model, GatorTron-OG, which was trained on the 82-billion-word clinical dataset.</p>
<p>More impressively, it was able to do so using less data.</p>
<p>Both GatorTron-OG and GatorTron-S models were trained on 560 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> running NVIDIA’s Megatron-LM package on the University of Florida’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/university-of-florida-rankings-ai/">HiPerGator supercomputer</a>. Technology from the Megatron LM framework used in the project has since been incorporated with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a> framework, which has been central to more recent work on GatorTronGPT.</p>
<p>Using synthetic data created by LLMs addresses several challenges. LLMs require vast amounts of data, and there’s a limited availability of quality medical data.</p>
<p>In addition, synthetic data allows for model training that complies with medical privacy regulations, such as HIPAA.</p>
<p>The work with GatorTronGPT is just the latest example of how LLMs — which exploded onto the scene last year with the rapid adoption of ChatGPT — can be tailored to assist in a growing number of fields.</p>
<p>It’s also an example of the advances made possible by new AI techniques powered by accelerated computing.</p>
<p>The GatorTronGPT effort is the latest result of an <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/university-of-florida-nvidia-ai-supercomputer/">ambitious collaboration</a> announced in 2020, when the University of Florida and NVIDIA unveiled plans to erect the world’s fastest AI supercomputer in academia.</p>
<p>This initiative was driven by a $50 million gift, a fusion of contributions from NVIDIA founder Chris Malachowsky and NVIDIA itself.</p>
<p>Using AI to train more AI is just one example of HiPerGator’s impact, with the supercomputer promising to power more innovations in medical sciences and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/uf-health-syngatortron-ai-synthetic-clinical-data/">across disciplines</a> throughout the University of Florida system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Human analysts can no longer effectively defend against the increasing speed and complexity of cybersecurity attacks. The amount of data is simply too large to screen manually.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">Generative AI</a>, the most transformative tool of our time, enables a kind of digital jiu jitsu. It lets companies shift the force of data that threatens to overwhelm them into a force that makes their defenses stronger.</p>
<p>Business leaders seem ready for the opportunity at hand. In a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/c-suite-study/ceo">recent survey</a>, CEOs said cybersecurity is one of their top three concerns, and they see generative AI as a lead technology that will deliver competitive advantages.</p>
<p>Generative AI brings both risks and benefits. An earlier blog outlined <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-security-steps/">six steps to start the process of securing enterprise AI</a>.</p>
<p>Here are three ways generative AI can bolster cybersecurity.</p>
<h2><b>Begin With Developers</b></h2>
<p>First, give developers a security copilot.</p>
<p>Everyone plays a role in security, but not everyone is a security expert. So, this is one of the most strategic places to begin.</p>
<p>The best place to start bolstering security is on the front end, where developers are writing software. An AI-powered assistant, trained as a security expert, can help them ensure their code follows best practices in security.</p>
<p>The AI software assistant can get smarter every day if it’s fed previously reviewed code. It can learn from prior work to help guide developers on best practices.</p>
<p>To give users a leg up, NVIDIA is creating a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/ai-workflows/generative-ai-chatbots/">workflow for building such co-pilots or chatbots</a>. This particular workflow uses components from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, a framework for building and customizing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">large language models</a>.</p>
<p>Whether users customize their own models or use a commercial service, a security assistant is just the first step in applying generative AI to cybersecurity.</p>
<h2><b>An Agent to Analyze Vulnerabilities</b></h2>
<p>Second, let generative AI help navigate the sea of known software vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>At any moment, companies must choose among thousands of patches to mitigate known exploits. That’s because every piece of code can have roots in dozens if not thousands of different software branches and open-source projects.</p>
<p>An LLM focused on vulnerability analysis can help prioritize which patches a company should implement first. It’s a particularly powerful security assistant because it reads all the software libraries a company uses as well as its policies on the features and APIs it supports.</p>
<p>To test this concept, NVIDIA built a pipeline to analyze software containers for vulnerabilities. The agent identified areas that needed patching with high accuracy, speeding the work of human analysts up to 4x.</p>
<p>The takeaway is clear. It’s time to enlist generative AI as a first responder in vulnerability analysis.</p>
<h2><b>Fill the Data Gap</b></h2>
<p>Finally, use LLMs to help fill the growing data gap in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Users rarely share information about data breaches because they’re so sensitive. That makes it difficult to anticipate exploits.</p>
<p>Enter LLMs. Generative AI models can create <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/">synthetic data</a> to simulate never-before-seen attack patterns. Such synthetic data can also fill gaps in training data so machine-learning systems learn how to defend against exploits before they happen.</p>
<h2><b>Staging Safe Simulations</b></h2>
<p>Don’t wait for attackers to demonstrate what’s possible. Create safe simulations to learn how they might try to penetrate corporate defenses.</p>
<p>This kind of proactive defense is the hallmark of a strong security program. Adversaries are already using generative AI in their attacks. It’s time users harness this powerful technology for cybersecurity defense.</p>
<p>To show what’s possible, another <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/ai-workflows/spear-phishing/">AI workflow</a> uses generative AI to defend against spear phishing — the carefully targeted bogus emails that cost companies an estimated $2.4 billion in 2021 alone.</p>
<p>This workflow generated synthetic emails to make sure it had plenty of good examples of spear phishing messages. The AI model trained on that data learned to understand the intent of incoming emails through natural language processing capabilities in <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/morpheus-cybersecurity">NVIDIA Morpheus</a>, a framework for AI-powered cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The resulting model caught 21% more spear phishing emails than existing tools. Check out our <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-and-accelerated-computing-for-spear-phishing-detection/">developer blog</a> or watch the video below to learn more.</p>

<p>Wherever users choose to start this work, automation is crucial, given the shortage of cybersecurity experts and the thousands upon thousands of users and use cases that companies need to protect.</p>
<p>These three tools — software assistants, virtual vulnerability analysts and synthetic data simulations — are great starting points for applying generative AI to a security journey that continues every day.</p>
<p>But this is just the beginning. Companies need to integrate generative AI into all layers of their defenses.</p>
