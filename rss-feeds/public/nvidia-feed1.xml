										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The 96th Academy Awards nominees for Best Visual Effects are a testament to the incredible technological advancements pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in film.</p>
<p>Whether showcasing colossal destruction scenes, heart-pumping action sequences or interstellar adventures, each nominee demonstrates unique contributions in visual effects, or VFX — and they all used cutting-edge NVIDIA technologies in their workflows to bring their magic to the screen.</p>
<p>This year’s nominees include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>The Creator</i></b> (20th Century Studios) — Jay Cooper, Ian Comley, Andrew Roberts and Neil Corbould</li>
<li><b><i>Godzilla: Minus One</i></b> (Toho) — Takashi Yamazaki, Kiyoko Shibuya, Masaki Takahashi and Tatsuji Nojima</li>
<li><b><i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i></b> (Marvel Studios) — Stephane Ceretti, Alexis Wajsbrot, Guy Williams and Theo Bialek</li>
<li><b><i>Napoleon</i></b> (Apple Original Films/Sony Pictures) — Charley Henley, Luc-Ewen Martin-Fenouillet, Simone Coco and Neil Corbould</li>
<li><b><i>Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One</i></b> (Paramount Pictures) — Alex Wuttke, Simone Coco, Jeff Sutherland and Neil Corbould</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Reinventing the Monster Movie</b></h2>
<p><i>Godzilla: Minus One</i> presented a unique challenge: making a well-known giant monster, or kaijū, feel terrifying anew.</p>
<p>With a budget under $15 million, small by today’s standards, the film’s VFX team relied on rapid iterations with the director to eliminate long review cycles, along with a heavily detailed computer-generated imagery (CGI) model to bring Godzilla to life.</p>
<p>Godzilla was ready for its closeup, the monster’s head alone containing over 200 million polygons. The animators injected nuanced, lifelike behaviors into the creature to round out its performance.</p>
<p>In addition, the film’s destruction scenes used a sophisticated, memory-intensive physics engine, allowing for realistic simulations of crumbling buildings and landscapes under destruction to further immerse audiences in the chaos.</p>
<h2><b>A Cosmic Spectacle</b></h2>
<p><i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i> continued the series’s tradition of blending humor with breathtaking cosmic visuals. This installment pushed the envelope with its use of real-time rendering, enabling its artists to visualize complex space environments and characters on set.</p>
<p>The film brought together Wētā FX, Framestore and Sony Pictures Imageworks, among others, to create a whopping 3,000+ VFX shots. The dense, immersive 3D environments allowed for a seamless integration of live-action and CGI elements and characters, resulting in a visually stunning space opera that maintained the series’ signature style while exploring new visual territories.</p>
<p>One of <i>Guardians</i>’s greatest achievements is the hallway fight scene filmed at 120 frames per second and delivered as a single continuous shot with variable speed ramps and nonstop action.</p>
<h2><b>Epic Storytelling Through Detailed VFX</b></h2>
<p>The historical epic <i>Napoleon </i>was brought to life with meticulous attention to detail and scale. The film used various set extensions and practical effects to recreate the vast battlefields and period-specific architecture of early 19th-century Europe.</p>
<p>Advanced crowd simulation was used to depict the massive armies of Napoleon’s time, each soldier animated with individual behaviors to enhance the battle scenes’ realism. These touches, combined with high-resolution textures and dynamic lighting, created a visually compelling narrative grounded in reality.</p>
<h2><b>Exploring AI’s Boundaries</b></h2>
<p><i>The Creator</i> explored the themes of AI and virtual reality, requiring VFX that could realistically depict advanced technology and digital worlds.</p>
<p>The film made significant use of CG animation and visual effects to create environments both futuristic and plausible. Director Gareth Edwards, also known for <i>Rogue One</i> and <i>Godzilla (2014),</i> has been widely applauded for delivering a film with the look of an expensive summer blockbuster using a fraction of the typical budget.</p>
<p>The portrayal of AI entities involved a combination of motion-capture and procedural animation to create characters that moved and interacted with complexity and fluidity at human level. The VFX team developed custom software to simulate the intricate patterns of digital consciousness, blurring the lines between the virtual and the real.</p>
<h2><b>High-Octane Action Meets Precision VFX</b></h2>
<p>For <i>Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning Part One</i>, the visual effects team faced the challenge of enhancing the film’s signature action sequences without detracting from the series’s reputation for practical stunts. To achieve this, they took a hybrid approach, using CGI to seamlessly augment practical effects.</p>
<p>High-speed drone footage integrated with CG elements created breathtaking chase scenes, while advanced compositing techniques added layers of detail and depth to explosions and hand-to-hand combat scenes, elevating the film’s action to new heights.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>For some NVIDIANs, it’s always game day.</p>
<p>Our Santa Clara-based software quality assurance team boasts some of the world’s top gamers, whose search for bugs and errors is as strategic as their battle plans for toppling top-tier opponents in video games.</p>
<p>Two team members of the QA team — friendly colleagues in the office but fierce rivals in the esports arena — recently competed against one another at the finals of the Guildhouse Fighters tournament, a local circuit in Northern California.</p>
<p>Eduardo “PR Balrog” Perez-Frangie, a veteran <i>Street Fighter</i> player, fought his way to the Grand Final to face Miky “Samurai” Chea.</p>
<p>Perez-Frangie came out on top, but there was a twist: he’d brought to the contest his two-year-old son, who fell asleep on his father’s chest mid-match. “I played the rest of the game with a deadweight in my lap,” he said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_70005" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70005" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-70005" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4730_L-1-672x448.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="448" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4730_L-1-672x448.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4730_L-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4730_L-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4730_L-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4730_L-1-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4730_L-1-675x450.jpg 675w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4730_L-1-323x215.jpg 323w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4730_L-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4730_L-1-1280x853.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-70005" class="wp-caption-text">Perez-Frangie and Chea play at work — guess who won? QA team members Alyssa Ruiz and DaJuan McDaniel cheer them on.</figcaption></figure>
<h2><b>A Competitive Spirit</b></h2>
<p>Perez-Frangie has competed for 15 years in a series of fighting game titles, including <i>Marvel vs. Capcom</i>, <i>Killer Instinct</i> and <i>Mortal Kombat</i>. He was part of the Evil Geniuses esports organization when he joined NVIDIA almost a decade ago but now plays without a sponsor so he can enjoy more family time.</p>
<p>He’s played against Chea in esports events for years, and they’re just as competitive in the office as in the stadiums.</p>
<p>“Even when we’re in the test environment, when we’re looking for bugs, we are competitive,” Perez-Frangie said. “But Miky stays calm — he was a teacher, so he can put everyone in their place.”</p>
<p>Chea’s days teaching kindergarten through eighth grade in Fresno, California, are behind him, but the coaching aspect of his current gaming-related role reminds him of the classroom — a place to share insights and takeaways.</p>
<p>As new games are released and older ones updated, “the hardware and software stack needs to work in harmony,” Chea said. “Our pro gaming team is the last line of defense to ensure our customers have the best gaming experience possible.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_70008" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70008" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-70008" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NZ9_4939_L-1-672x448.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="448" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NZ9_4939_L-1-672x448.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NZ9_4939_L-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NZ9_4939_L-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NZ9_4939_L-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NZ9_4939_L-1-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NZ9_4939_L-1-675x450.jpg 675w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NZ9_4939_L-1-323x215.jpg 323w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NZ9_4939_L-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NZ9_4939_L-1-1280x853.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-70008" class="wp-caption-text">The QA team gathers to check out a new game.</figcaption></figure>
<p>QA team member DaJuan “Shroomed” McDaniel is a top-ranked <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> player whose signature characters are Sheik and Marth. He’s also widely considered to be the best <i>Dr. Mario</i> player of all time.</p>
<p>“Being a competitive gamer, visual fidelity is so important,” McDaniel said. “We can see and feel visual anomalies, frame discrepancies, general latency and anything that’s off in ways that others won’t see.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_70011" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70011" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-70011" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4554_L-1-672x448.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="448" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4554_L-1-672x448.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4554_L-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4554_L-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4554_L-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4554_L-1-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4554_L-1-675x450.jpg 675w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4554_L-1-323x215.jpg 323w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4554_L-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-NZ9_4554_L-1-1280x853.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-70011" class="wp-caption-text">McDaniel playing “Cyberpunk 2077.”</figcaption></figure>
<h2><b>A Winning Formula</b></h2>
<p>Alyssa Ruiz joined the QA team a year ago, initially testing drivers as part of the pro gaming team before switching to testing <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/dlss">NVIDIA DLSS</a>, a suite of neural rendering techniques that use deep learning to improve image quality and performance.</p>
<p>Introduced to gaming by her brothers through <i>Halo 3</i>, she later dedicated hours to <i>Fortnite</i> before deciding to stream the gameplay directly from her console. She posted the content to TikTok and began playing in online tournaments. By then, her game of choice was Riot Games’ <i>Valorant</i>.</p>
<p>“The game has a large female player base with visually appealing graphics and an engrossing storyline,” she said. “It can be more complex than a fighting game because it relies on a combination of abilities with strategies. It’s also a team game, so if someone isn’t pulling their weight, it’s a loss for all of us.”</p>
<p>That’s not unlike the team dynamic in the office.</p>
<figure id="attachment_70014" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70014" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-70014" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Team-crop1-672x378.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Team-crop1-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Team-crop1-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Team-crop1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Team-crop1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Team-crop1-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Team-crop1-800x450.jpg 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Team-crop1-382x215.jpg 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Team-crop1-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Team-crop1-1280x720.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-70014" class="wp-caption-text">Perez-Frangie, Ruiz, Chea and McDaniel.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Each member brings their own specialties to the testing environment, where they’re using their keen eyes to scrutinize DLSS technologies.</p>
<p>Their acute awareness of game latency and image fidelity — honed through hundreds of hours of gameplay — means the team can achieve better test coverage all around.</p>
<p>“We’re all very competitive, but there’s a real diversity that contributes to a stronger team,” Ruiz said. “And we all get along really well.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p dir="ltr">Artificial intelligence, like any transformative technology, is a work in progress — continually growing in its capabilities and its societal impact. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/trustworthy-ai/">Trustworthy AI initiatives</a> recognize the real-world effects that AI can have on people and society, and aim to channel that power responsibly for positive change.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What Is Trustworthy AI?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Trustworthy AI is an approach to AI development that prioritizes safety and transparency for those who interact with it. <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/tag/trustworthy-ai/">Developers of trustworthy AI</a> understand that no model is perfect, and take steps to help customers and the general public understand how the technology was built, its intended use cases and its limitations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to complying with privacy and consumer protection laws, trustworthy AI models are tested for safety, security and mitigation of unwanted bias. They’re also transparent — providing information such as accuracy benchmarks or a description of the training dataset — to various audiences including regulatory authorities, developers and consumers.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Principles of Trustworthy AI</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/trustworthy-ai/">Trustworthy AI principles</a> are foundational to NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI development. They have a simple goal: to enable trust and transparency in AI and support the work of partners, customers and developers.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Privacy: Complying With Regulations, Safeguarding Data</h3>
<p dir="ltr">AI is often described as data hungry. Often, the more data an algorithm is trained on, the more accurate its predictions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But data has to come from somewhere. To develop trustworthy AI, it’s key to consider not just what data is legally available to use, but what data is socially responsible to use.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Developers of AI models that rely on data such as a person’s image, voice, artistic work or health records should evaluate whether individuals have provided appropriate consent for their personal information to be used in this way.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For institutions like hospitals and banks, building AI models means balancing the responsibility of keeping patient or customer data private while training a robust algorithm. NVIDIA has created technology that enables <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-federated-learning/">federated learning</a>, where researchers develop AI models trained on data from multiple institutions without confidential information leaving a company’s private servers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/data-center/dgx-systems/">NVIDIA DGX systems</a> and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/flare">NVIDIA FLARE</a> software have enabled several federated learning projects in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/federated-learning-nature-medicine/">healthcare</a> and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/using-federated-learning-to-bridge-data-silos-in-financial-services/">financial services</a>, facilitating secure collaboration by multiple data providers on more accurate, generalizable AI models for <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/israel-medical-center-ai-startups-radiology/">medical image analysis</a> and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-fraud-detection-rapids-triton-tensorrt-nemo/">fraud detection</a>.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Safety and Security: Avoiding Unintended Harm, Malicious Threats</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Once deployed, AI systems have real-world impact, so it’s essential they perform as intended to preserve user safety.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The freedom to use publicly available AI algorithms creates immense possibilities for positive applications, but also means the technology can be used for unintended purposes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To help mitigate risks, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-chatbot-guardrails-nemo/">NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails</a> keeps AI language models on track by allowing enterprise developers to set boundaries for their applications. Topical guardrails ensure that chatbots stick to specific subjects. Safety guardrails set limits on the language and data sources the apps use in their responses. Security guardrails seek to prevent malicious use of a large language model that’s connected to third-party applications or application programming interfaces.</p>
<p dir="ltr">NVIDIA Research is working with the DARPA-run SemaFor program to <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3-detector" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help digital forensics experts identify AI-generated images</a>. Last year, researchers published a novel method for <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07371.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressing social bias using ChatGPT</a>. They’re also creating methods for <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/nxp/avatar-fingerprinting/">avatar fingerprinting</a> — a way to detect if someone is using an AI-animated likeness of another individual without their consent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To protect data and AI applications from security threats, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h200/">H200 Tensor Core GPUs</a> are built with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-confidential-computing/">confidential computing</a>, which ensures sensitive data is protected while in use, whether deployed on premises, in the cloud or at the edge. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/solutions/confidential-computing/">NVIDIA Confidential Computing</a> uses hardware-based security methods to ensure unauthorized entities can’t view or modify data or applications while they’re running — traditionally a time when data is left vulnerable.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Transparency: Making AI Explainable</h3>
<p dir="ltr">To create a trustworthy AI model, the algorithm can’t be a black box — its creators, users and stakeholders must be able to understand how the AI works to trust its results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Transparency in AI is a set of best practices, tools and design principles that helps users and other stakeholders understand how an AI model was trained and how it works. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-explainable-ai/">Explainable AI</a>, or XAI, is a subset of transparency covering tools that inform stakeholders how an AI model makes certain predictions and decisions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Transparency and XAI are crucial to establishing trust in AI systems, but there’s no universal solution to fit every kind of AI model and stakeholder. Finding the right solution involves a systematic approach to identify who the AI affects, analyze the associated risks and implement effective mechanisms to provide information about the AI system.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">Retrieval-augmented generation</a>, or RAG, is a technique that advances AI transparency by connecting generative AI services to authoritative external databases, enabling models to cite their sources and provide more accurate answers. NVIDIA is helping developers get started with a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/ai-workflows/generative-ai-chatbots/">RAG workflow</a> that uses the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a> framework for developing and customizing generative AI models.</p>
<p dir="ltr">NVIDIA is also part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute Consortium, or AISIC, to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/aisic-trustworthy-ai/">help create tools and standards for responsible AI development</a> and deployment. As a consortium member, NVIDIA will promote trustworthy AI by leveraging best practices for implementing AI model transparency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And on NVIDIA’s hub for accelerated software, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/">NGC</a>, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/enhancing-ai-transparency-and-ethical-considerations-with-model-card/">model cards</a> offer detailed information about how each AI model works and was built. NVIDIA’s Model Card ++ format describes the datasets, training methods and performance measures used, licensing information, as well as specific ethical considerations.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Nondiscrimination: Minimizing Bias</h3>
<p dir="ltr">AI models are trained by humans, often using data that is limited by size, scope and diversity. To ensure that all people and communities have the opportunity to benefit from this technology, it’s important to reduce unwanted bias in AI systems.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond following government guidelines and antidiscrimination laws, trustworthy AI developers mitigate potential unwanted bias by looking for clues and patterns that suggest an algorithm is discriminatory, or involves the inappropriate use of certain characteristics. Racial and gender bias in data are well-known, but other considerations include cultural bias and bias introduced during data labeling. To reduce unwanted bias, developers might incorporate different variables into their models.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Synthetic datasets offer one solution to reduce unwanted bias in training data used to develop AI for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/">autonomous vehicles</a> and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim">robotics</a>. If data used to train self-driving cars underrepresents uncommon scenes such as extreme weather conditions or traffic accidents, synthetic data can help augment the diversity of these datasets to better represent the real world, helping improve AI accuracy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Nations have long invested in domestic infrastructure to advance their economies, control their own data and take advantage of technology opportunities in areas such as transportation, communications, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.</p>
<p>AI, the most important technology of our time, is turbocharging innovation across every facet of society. It’s expected to generate trillions of dollars in economic dividends and productivity gains.</p>
<p>Countries are investing in sovereign AI to develop and harness such benefits on their own. Sovereign AI refers to a nation’s capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks.</p>
<h2><b>Why Sovereign AI Is Important</b></h2>
<p>The global imperative for nations to invest in sovereign AI capabilities has grown since the rise of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a>, which is reshaping markets, challenging governance models, inspiring new industries and transforming others — from gaming to biopharma. It’s also rewriting the nature of work, as people in many fields start using AI-powered “copilots.”</p>
<p>Sovereign AI encompasses both physical and data infrastructures. The latter includes sovereign foundation models, such as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language models</a>, developed by local teams and trained on local datasets to promote inclusiveness with specific dialects, cultures and practices.</p>
<p>For example, speech AI models can help <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/te-hiku-media-maori-speech-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preserve, promote and revitalize indigenous languages</a>. And <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LLMs</a> aren’t just for teaching AIs human languages, but for writing software code, protecting consumers from financial fraud, teaching robots physical skills and much more.</p>
<p>In addition, as artificial intelligence and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accelerated computing</a> become increasingly critical tools for <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-energy-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combating climate change</a>, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/energy-efficient-ai-industries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosting energy efficiency</a> and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-cybersecurity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protecting against cybersecurity threats</a>, sovereign AI has a pivotal role to play in equipping every nation to bolster its sustainability efforts.</p>
<h2><b>Factoring In AI Factories</b></h2>
<p>Comprising new, essential infrastructure for AI production are “AI factories,” where data comes in and intelligence comes out. These are next-generation data centers that host advanced, full-stack accelerated computing platforms for the most computationally intensive tasks.</p>
<p>Nations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models. Some are procuring and operating sovereign AI clouds in collaboration with state-owned <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/telecommunications/ai-factories/">telecommunications providers</a> or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public- and private-sector use.</p>
<p>“The AI factory will become the bedrock of modern economies across the world,” NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in a recent media Q&amp;A.</p>
<h2><b>Sovereign AI Efforts Underway</b></h2>
<p>Nations around the world are already investing in sovereign AI.</p>
<p>Since 2019, NVIDIA’s <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/global-public-sector/">AI Nations initiative</a> has helped countries spanning every region of the globe to build sovereign AI capabilities, including ecosystem enablement and workforce development, creating the conditions for engineers, developers, scientists, entrepreneurs, creators and public sector officials to pursue their AI ambitions at home.</p>
<p>France-based <a href="https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/iliad-strapi/DP_iliad_AI_260923_Eng_462ff3265c.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scaleway</a>, a subsidiary of the iliad Group, is building Europe’s most powerful cloud-native AI supercomputer. The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD</a> comprises 127 DGX H100 systems, representing 1,016 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> interconnected by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA NVLink technology</a> and the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform</a>. NVIDIA DGX systems also include <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software for secure, supported and stable AI development and deployment.</p>
<p>Swisscom Group, majority-owned by the Swiss government, recently announced its Italian subsidiary, <a href="https://www.thefastmode.com/technology-solutions/34250-fastweb-leverages-nvidia-dgx-supercomputer-to-develop-italian-genai-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fastweb</a>, will build Italy’s first and most powerful NVIDIA DGX-powered supercomputer — also using NVIDIA AI Enterprise software — to develop the first LLM natively trained in the Italian language.</p>
<p>With these NVIDIA technologies and its own cloud and cybersecurity infrastructures, Fastweb plans to launch an end-to-end system with which Italian companies, public-administration organizations and startups can develop generative AI applications for any industry.</p>
<p>The government of India has also announced sovereign AI initiatives promoting workforce development, sustainable computing and private-sector investment in domestic compute capacity. India-based <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/tata-partners-with-nvidia-to-build-large-scale-ai-infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tata Group</a>, for example, is building a large-scale AI infrastructure powered by the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip</a>, while <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/reliance-and-nvidia-partner-to-advance-ai-in-india-for-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reliance Industries</a> will develop a foundation LLM tailored for generative AI and trained on the diverse languages of the world’s most populous nation. NVIDIA is also working with India’s top universities to support and expand local researcher and developer communities.</p>
<p>Japan is going all in with sovereign AI, collaborating with NVIDIA to upskill its workforce, support Japanese language model development, and expand AI adoption for natural disaster response and climate resilience. These efforts include public-private partnerships that are incentivizing leaders like <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/softbank-telecom-data-centers-grace-hopper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoftBank Corp.</a> to collaborate with NVIDIA on building a generative AI platform for 5G and 6G applications as well as a network of distributed AI factories.</p>
<p>Finally, Singapore is fostering a range of sovereign AI programs, including by partnering with NVIDIA to upgrade its National Super Computer Center, or NSCC, with NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In addition, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/singtel-sovereign-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Singtel</a>, a leading communications services provider building energy-efficient AI factories across Southeast Asia, is accelerated by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/hopper-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Hopper architecture GPUs</a> and NVIDIA AI reference architectures.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[YouTube content creator Ralph Panebianco really, really loves video games. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of our weekly </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/in-the-nvidia-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/"><i>NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> technology improves creative workflows. We’re also deep diving on new </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/"><i>GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU</i></a><i> features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.</i></p>
<p>YouTube content creator Ralph Panebianco really, <i>really</i> loves video games.</p>
<p>Since getting an original Nintendo Entertainment System at the age of four, Panebianco, this week’s featured <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i> creator, has spent much of his free time playing video games. He pursued a career in gaming in his native country of Australia before pivoting to content creation, opening a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SkillUp">Skill Up</a>, where he reviews the latest video games.</p>
<p>“When I wasn’t playing video games, I was reading about them, and now I get to talk about them for a living,” he said.</p>
<p>And calling all art fans: the latest Studio Standouts video features film noir-themed artwork brought to life with dramatic, monochromatic flair.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Film Noir: A Community Digital Art Showcase | NVIDIA Studio Standouts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uzp-5r8DluY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Video Editing Skillz</b></h2>
<p>Panebianco works with his partner to create in-depth, insightful reviews of the latest video games on his Skill Up YouTube channel, which has garnered nearly 1 million subscribers. Below is a recent video reviewing <i>Pacific Drive, </i>a title available on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/">NVIDIA GeForce NOW</a> cloud gaming service, powered by GeForce RTX GPUs.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="I strongly recommend: Pacific Drive (Review)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXxJ_66ksD4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>“Creatively, we don’t view game reviews as functional buying guides with a list of pros and cons,” said Panebianco. “We view reviews as a chance to crack a game open and really show the audience what makes it tick. They’re sort of mini-essays on game design, delving deep into why specific game mechanics do or don’t work.”</p>
<p>The content creation process begins with booting up the game on his PC, powered by the recently launched <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4080-family/">GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER</a> graphics card. This allows the Skill Up team to tap <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">RTX ray tracing</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS</a> — breakthrough technologies that use AI to create additional frames and improve image quality.</p>
<p>He records video footage primarily using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/">GeForce Experience</a>, a companion to NVIDIA GeForce GPUs that enables users to capture assets, optimize game settings and keep drivers up to date, among other features.</p>
<p>When footage requires high-dynamic range, the team uses the OBS Studio open-source software with AV1 hardware encoding to achieve <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/av1-obs29-youtube/">40% more efficient encoding</a> on average than H.264 and deliver higher quality than competing GPUs.</p>
<p>“The AV1 encoder is ridiculously efficient in terms of file size,” he said.</p>

<p>Once the footage is ready, Panebianco writes a video script in Microsoft Word and then records himself, using Audacity. He uses the AI-powered <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/">NVIDIA Broadcast</a> app, free for RTX GPU owners, to eliminate background noise and achieve professional studio quality.</p>
<p>Panebianco then hands off the files to his editor for production in Adobe Premiere Pro, where a number of GPU-accelerated, AI-powered features such as Enhance Speech, Auto Reframe and Unsharp Mask help speed the video editing process.</p>

<p>“Almost my entire workflow was enhanced by NVIDIA’s hardware,” Panebianco shared. “It’s not just about the hardware making for efficient encoding or lightning-fast, hardware-enabled rendering — it’s about the end-to-end toolset.”</p>
<p>Panebianco has words of wisdom for aspiring content creators.</p>
<p>“Worry less about the numbers and more about the quality,” he said. “The metrics grind pays little in the way of dividends, but putting out truly excellent content is an almost failure-proof path to growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The spirit of software legend Grace Hopper will live on at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/">NVIDIA GTC</a>.</p>
<p>Accelerated systems using powerful processors — named in honor of the pioneer of programming — will be on display at the global AI conference running March 18-21, ready to take computing to the next level.</p>
<p>System makers will show more than 500 servers in multiple configurations across 18 racks, all packing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/">NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips</a>. They’ll form the largest display at NVIDIA’s booth in the San Jose Convention Center, filling the MGX Pavilion.</p>
<h2><b>MGX Speeds Time to Market</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/mgx/">NVIDIA MGX</a> is a blueprint for building accelerated servers with any combination of GPUs, CPUs and data processing units (<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/whats-a-dpu-data-processing-unit/">DPUs</a>) for a wide range of AI, high performance computing and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> applications. It’s a modular reference architecture for use across multiple product generations and workloads.</p>
<p>GTC attendees can get an up-close look at MGX models tailored for enterprise, cloud and telco-edge uses, such as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> inference, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/whats-a-recommender-system/">recommenders</a> and data analytics.</p>
<p>The pavilion will showcase accelerated systems packing single and dual GH200 Superchips in 1U and 2U chassis, linked via <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/data-processing-unit/">NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/">NVIDIA Quantum-2</a> 400Gb/s InfiniBand networks over <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/interconnect/">LinkX</a> cables and transceivers.</p>

<li>Wistron’s MGX servers are 4U GPU systems for AI inference and mixed workloads, supporting up to eight accelerators in one system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new servers are in addition to three accelerated systems using MGX<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/computex-keynote-generative-ai/"> announced at COMPUTEX</a> last May — Supermicro’s ARS-221GL-NR using the Grace CPU and QCT’s QuantaGrid S74G-2U and S74GM-2U powered by the GH200.</p>
<h2><b>Grace Hopper Packs Two in One</b></h2>
<p>System builders are adopting the hybrid processor because it packs a punch.</p>
<p>GH200 Superchips combine a high-performance, power-efficient Grace CPU with a muscular <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 GPU</a>. They share hundreds of gigabytes of memory over a fast <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink-c2c/">NVIDIA NVLink-C2C</a> interconnect.</p>
<p>The result is a processor and memory complex well-suited to take on today’s most demanding jobs, such as running <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language models</a>. They have the memory and speed needed to link generative AI models to data sources that can improve their accuracy using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, aka RAG.</p>
<h2><b>Recommenders Run 4x Faster</b></h2>
<p>In addition, the GH200 Superchip delivers greater efficiency and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/grace-hopper-recommender-systems/">up to 4x more performance</a> than using the H100 GPU with traditional CPUs for tasks like making recommendations for online shopping or media streaming.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/grace-hopper-inference-mlperf/">debut</a> on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/mlperf-benchmarks/">MLPerf</a> industry benchmarks last November, GH200 systems ran all data center inference tests, extending the already leading performance of H100 GPUs.</p>
<p>In all these ways, GH200 systems are taking to new heights a computing revolution their namesake helped start on the first mainframe computers more than seven decades ago.</p>

<p>A failed furniture-shopping trip turned into a business idea for Steven Gay, cofounder and CEO of company <a href="https://www.modemaisonlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mode Maison</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-69984 size-thumbnail" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo-400x400.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo-450x450.jpg 450w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo-215x215.jpg 215w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo-100x100.jpg 100w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo.jpg 495w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p>Gay grew up in Houston and studied at the University of Texas before working in New York as one of the youngest concept designers at Ralph Lauren. He was inspired to start his own company after a long day of trying — and failing — to pick out a sofa.</p>
<p>The experience illuminated how the luxury home-goods industry has traditionally lagged in adopting digital technologies, especially those for creating immersive, interactive experiences for consumers.</p>
<p>Gay founded Mode Maison in 2018 with the goal of solving this challenge and paving the way for scalability, creativity and a generative future in retail. Using the Universal Scene Description framework, aka <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">OpenUSD</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platform, Gay, along with Mode Maison Chief Technology Officer Jakub Cech and the Mode Maison team, are helping enhance and digitalize entire product lifecycle processes — from design and manufacturing to consumer experiences.</p>

<p>They developed a photometric scanning system, called <a href="https://www.tmac.dev/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Total Material Appearance Capture</a>, which offers an unbiased, physically based approach to digitizing the material world that’s enabled by real-world embedded sensors.</p>
<p>TMAC captures proprietary data and the composition of any material, then turns it into input that serves as a single source of truth, which can be used for creating a fully digitized retail model. Using the system, along with OpenUSD and NVIDIA Omniverse, Mode Maison customers can create highly accurate <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/">digital twins</a> of any material or product.</p>
<p>“By enabling this, we’re effectively collapsing and fostering a complete integration across the entire product lifecycle process — from design and production to manufacturing to consumer experiences and beyond,” said Gay.</p>

<h2><b>Streamlining Workflows and Enhancing Productivity With Digital Twins</b></h2>
<p>Previously, Mode Maison faced significant challenges in creating physically based, highly flexible and scalable digital materials. The limitations were particularly noticeable when rendering complex materials and textures, or integrating digital models into cohesive, multilayered environments.</p>
<p>Using Omniverse helped Gay and his team overcome these challenges by offering advanced rendering capabilities, physics simulations and extensibility for AI training that unlock new possibilities in digital retail.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-69990 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-672x378.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-768x431.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-801x450.jpg 801w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-383x215.jpg 383w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-1280x719.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>Before using Omniverse and OpenUSD, Mode Maison used disjointed processes for digital material capture, modeling and rendering, often leading to inconsistencies, the inability to scale and minimal interoperability. After integrating Omniverse, the company experienced a streamlined, coherent workflow where high-fidelity digital twins can be created with greater efficiency and interoperability.</p>
<p>The team primarily uses Autodesk 3ds Max for design, and they import the 3D data using Omniverse Connectors. Gay says OpenUSD is playing an increasingly critical role in its workflows, especially when developing composable, flexible, interoperable capabilities across asset creation.</p>
<p>This enhanced pipeline starts with capturing high-fidelity material data using TMAC. The data is then processed and formatted into OpenUSD for the creation of physically based, scientifically accurate, high-fidelity digital twins.</p>
<p>“OpenUSD allows for an unprecedented level of collaboration and interoperability in creating complex, multi-layered capabilities and advanced digital materials,” Gay said. “Its ability to seamlessly integrate diverse digital assets and maintain their fidelity across various applications is instrumental in creating realistic, interactive digital twins for retail.”</p>

<p>OpenUSD and Omniverse have sped Mode Maison and their clients’ ability to bring products to market, reduced costs associated with building and modifying digital twins, and enhanced productivity through streamlined creation.</p>
<p>“Our work represents a major step toward a future where digital and physical realities will be seamlessly integrated,” said Gay. “This shift enhances consumer engagement and paves the way for more sustainable business practices by reducing the need for physical prototyping while enabling more precise manufacturing.”</p>
<p>As for emerging technological advancements in digital retail, Gay says AI will play a central role in creating hyper-personalized design, production, sourcing and front-end consumer experiences — all while reducing carbon footprints and paving the way for a more sustainable future in retail.</p>

<p>And this week <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i>, filmmaker James Matthews shares his short film, <i>Dive</i>, which was created with an Adobe Premiere Pro-powered workflow supercharged by his ASUS ZenBook Pro <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/laptops-desktops/">NVIDIA Studio</a> laptop with a GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card.</p>
<h2><b>Going With the Flow</b></h2>
<p>Matthews’ goal with <i>Dive</i> was to create a visual and auditory representation of what it feels like to get swallowed up in the creative editing process.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69919" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69919" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69919" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-672x250.png" alt="" width="672" height="250" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-672x250.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-400x149.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-768x286.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-842x314.png 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-406x151.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-188x70.png 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69919" class="wp-caption-text">Talk about a dream content creation location.</figcaption></figure>
<p>“When I’m really deep into an edit, I sometimes feel like I’m fully immersed into the film and the editing process itself,” he said. “It’s almost like a flow state, where time stands still and you are one with your own creativity.”</p>
<p>To capture and visualize that feeling, Matthews used the power of his ASUS ZenBook Pro NVIDIA Studio laptop equipped with a GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card.</p>
<p>He started by brainstorming — listening to music and sketching conceptual images with pencil and paper. Then, Matthews added a song to his Adobe Premiere Pro timeline and created a shot list, complete with cuts and descriptions of focal range, speed, camera movement, lighting and other details.</p>
<p>Next, he planned location and shooting times, paying special attention to lighting conditions.</p>
<p>“I always have my Premiere Pro timeline up so I can really see and feel what I need to create from the images I originally drew while building the concept in my head,” Matthews said. “This helps get the pacing of each shot right, by watching it back and possibly adding it into the timeline for a test.”</p>
<p>Then, Matthews started editing the footage in Premiere Pro, aided by his Studio laptop. His dedicated GPU-based NVIDIA video encoder (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-codec-sdk">NVENC</a>) enabled buttery-smooth playback and scrubbing of his high-resolution and multi-stream footage, saving countless hours.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA Studio | RTX Accelerates Adobe Premiere Pro" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/poTeo7Ft3xk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Matthews’ RTX GPU accelerated a variety of <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/ai-video-editing.html">AI-powered Adobe video editing tools</a>, such as Enhance Speech, Scene Edit Detection and Auto Color, which applies color corrections with just a few clicks.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Real-Time Video Editing and Faster Rendering in Adobe Premiere Pro with NVIDIA RTX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnVsfZT1wHU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, Matthews added sound design before exporting the final files twice as fast thanks to NVENC’s dual AV1 encoders.</p>
<p>“The entire edit used GPU acceleration,” he shared. “Effects in Premiere Pro, along with the NVENC video encoders on the GPU, unlocked a seamless workflow and essentially allowed me to get into my flow state faster.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/news/"><i>Into the Omniverse</i></a><i>, a series focused on how artists, developers and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advances in </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>OpenUSD</i></a><i> and </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>NVIDIA Omniverse</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<p>The combination of powerful 3D tools and groundbreaking technologies can transform the way designers bring their visions to life — and Universal Scene Description, or <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">OpenUSD</a>, is helping enable that synergy. It’s the framework on which the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platform that enables the development of OpenUSD-based tools and 3D workflows is based.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhinoceros</a>, commonly known as Rhino, or Rhino 3D, is a powerful computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D modeling software used across industries — from education and jewelry design to architecture and marine modeling. The most recent software release includes support for OpenUSD export, among other updates, establishing it among the many applications embracing the new 3D standard.</p>
<h2><b>Turning Creativity Into CAD Reality</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tanjalanggner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tanja Langgner</a>, 3D artist and illustrator, grew up in Austria and now lives in a converted pigsty in the English countryside. With a background in industrial design, she’s had the opportunity to work with a slew of design agencies across Europe.</p>
<p>For the past decade, she’s undertaken freelance work in production and visualization, helping clients with tasks ranging from concept design and ideation to CAD and 3D modeling. Often doing industrial design work, Langgner relies on Rhino to construct CAD models,  whether for production evaluation or rendering purposes.</p>
<p>When faced with designs requiring intricate surface patterns, “Rhino’s Grasshopper, a parametric modeler, is excellent in creating complex parametric shapes,” she said.</p>
<p>Langgner is no stranger to OpenUSD. She uses it to transfer assets easily from one application to another, allowing her to visualize her work more efficiently. With the new Rhino update, she can now export OpenUSD files from Rhino, further streamlining her design workflow.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/mathew-schwartz-openusd-omniverse/">Mathew Schwartz</a>, an assistant professor in architecture and design at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, also uses Rhino and OpenUSD in his 3D workflows. Schwartz’s research and design lab, <a href="https://www.siborglab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SiBORG</a>, focuses on understanding and improving design workflows, especially with regard to accessibility, human factors and automation.</p>
<p>With OpenUSD, he can combine his research, Python code, 3D environments and renders, with his favorite tools in Omniverse.</p>
<p>Schwartz, along with Langgner, recently joined a community livestream, where he shared more details about his research — including how he&#8217;s made navigation graphs that show how someone can move in a space if they’re using a wheelchair or crutches in real-time. With his industrial design experience, he demonstrated computation using Rhino 3D and the use of generative AI for a seamless design process.</p>
<p>“With OpenUSD and Omniverse, we’ve been able to expand the scope of our research, as we can easily combine data analysis and visualization with the design process,” he said.</p>

<h2><b>Rhino 3D Updates Simplify 3D Collaboration</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/e-news/1223u1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhino 8</a>, available now, brings significant enhancements to the 3D modeling experience. It enables the export of meshes, mesh vertex colors, physically based rendering materials and textures so users can seamlessly share and collaborate on 3D designs with enhanced visual elements.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/8/new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhino 8</a> release also includes <a href="https://youtu.be/n-JNwmO61jY?si=VUYAoZUbOSPqtqmH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improvements</a> to:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Modeling</b>: New features, including PushPull direct editing, a <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/features/shrinkwrap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShrinkWrap</a> function for creating water-tight meshes around various geometries, enhanced control over subdivision surfaces with the SubD Crease control tool, and improved functionality for smoother surface fillets.</li>
<li><b>Drawing and illustration</b>: Precision-boosting enhancements to clipping and sectioning operations, a new feature for creating reflected ceiling plans, major improvements to linetype options and enhanced UV mapping for better texture coordination.</li>
<li><b>Operating systems</b>: A faster-than-ever experience for Mac users thanks to Apple silicon processors and Apple Metal display technology, along with significantly accelerated rendering with the updated Cycles engine.</li>
<li><b>Development</b>: New Grasshopper components covering annotations, blocks, materials and user data, accompanied by a new, enhanced script editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future Rhino updates will feature an expansion of export capabilities to include NURBS curves and surfaces, subdivision modeling and the option to <a href="https://github.com/mcneel/RhinoUSD/tree/rhino-8.x/import_USD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">import OpenUSD</a> content.</p>
<p>The Rhino team actively seeks user feedback on desired import platforms and applications, continually working to make OpenUSD files widely accessible and adaptable across 3D environments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA, in collaboration with Google, today launched optimizations across all NVIDIA AI platforms for <a href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-open-models/">Gemma</a> — Google’s state-of-the-art new lightweight <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/gemma-2b">2 billion</a>&#8211; and <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/gemma-7b">7 billion</a>-parameter open language models that can be run anywhere, reducing costs and speeding innovative work for domain-specific use cases.</p>
<p>Teams from the companies worked closely together to accelerate the performance of Gemma — built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models — with <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a>, an open-source library for optimizing large language model inference, when running on NVIDIA GPUs in the data center, in the cloud, and locally on workstations with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a> GPUs or PCs with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/">GeForce RTX</a> GPUs.</p>
<p>This allows developers to target the installed base of over 100 million NVIDIA RTX GPUs available in high-performance AI PCs globally.</p>
<p>Developers can also run Gemma on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud, including on Google Cloud’s A3 instances based on the H100 Tensor Core GPU and soon, NVIDIA’s <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-supercharges-hopper-the-worlds-leading-ai-computing-platform">H200 Tensor Core GPUs</a> — featuring 141GB of HBM3e memory at 4.8 terabytes per second — which Google will deploy this year.</p>
<p>Enterprise developers can additionally take advantage of NVIDIA’s rich ecosystem of tools — including <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo">NeMo framework</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM">TensorRT-LLM</a> — to fine-tune Gemma and deploy the optimized model in their production applications.</p>
<p>Learn more about how <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-revs-up-inference-for-google-gemma/">TensorRT-LLM is revving up inference for Gemma</a>, along with additional information for developers. This includes several model checkpoints of Gemma and the FP8-quantized version of the model, all optimized with TensorRT-LLM.</p>
<p>Experience <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/gemma-2b">Gemma 2B</a> and <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/gemma-7b">Gemma 7B</a> directly from your browser on the NVIDIA AI Playground.</p>
<h2><b>Gemma Coming to Chat With RTX</b></h2>
<p>Adding support for Gemma soon is <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/chat-with-rtx-available-now/">Chat with RTX</a>, an NVIDIA tech demo that uses <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a> and TensorRT-LLM software to give users generative AI capabilities on their local, RTX-powered Windows PCs.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Create A Personalized AI Chatbot with Chat With RTX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gdsRJZT3IJw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The Chat with RTX lets users personalize a chatbot with their own data by easily connecting local files on an RTX PC to a large language model.</p>
<p>Since the model runs locally, it provides results fast, and user data stays on the device. Rather than relying on cloud-based LLM services, Chat with RTX lets users process sensitive data on a local PC without the need to share it with a third party or have an internet connection.</p>
