										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>In the latest ranking of the world’s most energy-efficient supercomputers, known as the <a href="https://top500.org/lists/green500/2024/06/">Green500</a>, NVIDIA-powered systems swept the top three spots, and took seven of the top 10.</p>
<p>The strong showing demonstrates how accelerated computing represents the most energy-efficient method for high-performance computing.</p>
<p>The top three systems were all powered by the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/">NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip</a>, showcasing the widespread adoption and efficiency of NVIDIA’s Grace Hopper architecture.</p>
<p>Leading the pack was the JEDI system, at Germany’s <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de">Forschungszentrum Jülich</a>, which achieved an impressive 72.73 GFlops per Watt.</p>
<p>More’s coming. The ability to do more work using less power is driving the construction of more Grace Hopper supercomputers around the world.</p>
<h2><strong>Accelerating the Green Revolution in Supercomputing</strong></h2>
<p>Such achievements underscore NVIDIA’s pivotal role in advancing the global agenda for sustainable high-performance computing over the past decade.</p>
<p>Accelerated computing has proven to be the cornerstone of energy efficiency, with the majority of systems on the Green500 list — including 40 of the top 50 — now featuring this advanced technology.</p>
<p>Pioneered by NVIDIA, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/#:~:text=Accelerated%20computing%20uses%20parallel%20processing,analytics%20to%20simulations%20and%20visualizations.">accelerated computing</a> uses GPUs that optimize throughput — getting a lot done at once — to perform complex computations faster than systems based on CPUs alone.</p>
<p>And the Grace Hopper architecture is proving to be a game-changer by enhancing computational speed and dramatically increasing energy efficiency across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>For example, the GH200 chip embedded within the Grace Hopper systems offers over 1,000x more energy efficiency on mixed precision and AI tasks than previous generations.</p>
<h2><strong>Redefining Efficiency in Supercomputing</strong></h2>
<p>This capability is crucial for accelerating tasks that address complex scientific challenges, speeding up the work of researchers across various disciplines.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s supercomputing technology excels in traditional benchmarks — and it’s set new standards in energy efficiency.</p>
<p>For instance, the Alps system, at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS), is equipped with NVIDIA Grace Hopper GH200. The CSCS submission optimized for the Green500, dubbed preAlps,It recorded 270 petaflops on the High-Performance Linpack benchmark, used for solving complex linear equations.</p>
<p>The Green500 rankings highlight platforms that provide highly efficient FP64 performance, which is crucial for accurate simulations used in scientific computing. This result underscores NVIDIA&#8217;s commitment to powering supercomputers for tasks across a full range of capabilities.</p>
<p>This metric demonstrates substantial system performance, leading to its high ranking on the TOP500 list of the world&#8217;s fastest supercomputers. The high position on the Green500 list indicates that this scalable performance does not come at the cost of energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Such performance shows how the Grace Hopper architecture introduces a new era in processing technology, merging tightly coupled CPU and GPU functionalities to enhance not only performance but also significantly improve energy efficiency.</p>
<p>This advancement is supported by the incorporation of an optimized high-efficiency link that moves data between the CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s upcoming <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing">Blackwell platform</a> is set to build on this by offering the computational power of the Titan supercomputer launched 10 years ago — a $100 million system the size of a tennis court — yet be efficient enough to be powered by a wall socket just like a typical home appliance.</p>
<p>In short, over the past decade, NVIDIA innovations have enhanced the accessibility and sustainability of high-performance computing, making scientific breakthroughs faster, cheaper and greener.</p>
<h2><strong>A Future Defined by Sustainable Innovation</strong></h2>
<p>As NVIDIA continues to push the boundaries of what’s possible in high-performance computing, it remains committed to enhancing the energy efficiency of global computing infrastructure.</p>
<p>The success of the Grace Hopper supercomputers in the Green500 rankings highlights NVIDIA’s leadership and its commitment to more sustainable global computing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of our </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/in-the-nvidia-studio/"><i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/"><i>NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> technology improves creative workflows. We’re also deep diving on new </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/"><i>GeForce RTX GPU</i></a><i> features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.</i></p>
<p>A superbloom of creative app updates, included in the May Studio Driver, is ready for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/">download</a> today.</p>
<p>New GPU-accelerated and AI-powered apps and features are now available, backed by the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/">NVIDIA Studio</a> platform.</p>
<p>And this week’s featured<i> In the NVIDIA Studio </i>artist, Yao Chan, created the whimsical, spring-inspired 3D scene <i>By the Window</i> using her <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/desktop-graphics/">NVIDIA RTX GPU</a>.</p>
<h2><b>May’s Creative App Rundown</b></h2>
<p>RTX Video is a collection of AI enhancements that improves the quality of video played on apps like YouTube, Prime Video and Disney+. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-video-super-resolution/">RTX Video Super Resolution</a> (VSR) upscales video for cleaner, crisper imagery, while <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-video-hdr-remix-studio-driver/">RTX Video HDR</a> transforms standard dynamic range video content to high-dynamic range (HDR10), improving its visibility, details and vibrancy.</p>
<p>Mozilla Firefox, the third most popular PC browser, has added support for RTX VSR and HDR, including AI-enhanced upscaling, de-artifacting and HDR effects for most streamed videos.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx-remix/">NVIDIA RTX Remix</a> allows modders to easily capture game assets, automatically enhance materials with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> tools and create stunning RTX remasters with full ray tracing. RTX Remix recently added DLSS 3.5 support featuring Ray Reconstruction, an AI model that creates higher-quality images for intensive ray-traced games and apps, to the modding toolkit.</p>
<p><iframe title="RTX Remix - Remaster the Classics with RTX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/27LkeFtuq48?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Game developers interested in creating their own ray-traced mod for a classic game can <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx-remix/">download the RTX Remix Beta</a> and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4w6jm6S2lzvgJ97T1_VbLGBR_l6zzOUm">tutorial videos</a> to get a head start.</p>
<p>Maxon’s Cinema 4D modeling software empowers 3D video effects artists and motion designers to create complex scenes with ease. The integration of the software’s Version 2024.4 with C4D’s Unified Simulation systems now enables control of emission fields to modify behaviors more precisely.</p>
<p><iframe title="Maxon One Spring 2024 Release" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ySqAzYSRms?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This integration unlocks the ability to orchestrate object interactions with different simulation types, including Pyro, Cloth, soft bodies and rigid bodies. These simulations run considerably faster depending on the RTX GPU in use.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/audio2face/">NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face</a> app for iClone 8 uses AI to produce expressive facial animations solely from audio input. In addition to generating natural lip-sync animations for multilingual dialogue, the latest standalone release supports multilingual lip-sync and singing animations, as well as full-spectrum editing with slider controls and a keyframe editor.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Audio2Face - AI-Powered Facial &amp; Lip Sync Animation | iClone" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ScMb1f1M9yU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Along with accurate lip-sync, facial animations are significantly enhanced by nuanced facial expressions. Pairing Audio2Face with the iClone AccuFACE plug-in, powered by NVIDIA Maxine, Reallusion provides a flexible and multifaceted approach to facial animation, laying the groundwork with audio tracks and adding subtle expressions with webcams.</p>
<p>These latest AI-powered tools and creative app power ups are available for NVIDIA and GeForce RTX GPU owners.</p>
<h2><b>All Things Small, Bright and Beautiful</b></h2>
<p>China-based 3D visual effects artist Yao Chan finds inspiration and joy in the small things in life.</p>
<p>“As the weather gradually warms up, everything is rejuvenating and flowers are blooming,” said Chan. “I want to create an illustration that captures the warm and bright atmosphere of spring.”</p>
<p>Her 3D scene <i>By the Window</i> closely resembles a corner of her home filled with various succulent plants, pots and neatly arranged gardening tools.</p>
<p>“I think everyone has a place or moment that warms their heart in one way or another, and that&#8217;s an emotion I want to share with my audience,” said the artist.</p>
<p>Chan usually first sketches out her ideas in Adobe Photoshop, but with her real-life reference already set, she dove right into blocking out the scene in Blender.</p>
<p>Since she wanted to use a hand-painted texture style for modeling the vases and pots, Chan added Blender&#8217;s displace modifier and used a Voronoi texture to give the shapes a handcrafted effect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>AI heralds a new era of innovation for every business in every industry, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said Monday during an appearance at Dell Technologies World.</p>
<p>“We now have the ability to manufacture intelligence,” Huang said during an on-stage conversation with Dell CEO Michael Dell. “The last Industrial Revolution was the manufacturing of software; previously, it was manufacturing electricity — now we are manufacturing intelligence.”<br />
<i><br />
</i>Together with Michael Dell, ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott and Samsung SDS President and CEO Hwang Sung-woo, Huang shared his insights on the transformative impact of generative AI on the global economy and various industries.</p>

<p>This includes the Dell PowerEdge XE9680L server with liquid cooling and eight NVIDIA Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs, the industry’s densest, energy-efficient rack-scale solutions for large Blackwell GPU deployments.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-71758" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dell-AI-Factory-672x302.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="302" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dell-AI-Factory-672x302.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dell-AI-Factory-400x180.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dell-AI-Factory-768x346.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dell-AI-Factory-1536x691.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dell-AI-Factory-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dell-AI-Factory-842x379.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dell-AI-Factory-406x183.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dell-AI-Factory-188x85.jpg 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dell-AI-Factory-1280x576.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></p>
<p>The Dell NativeEdge platform will automate the delivery of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software, helping developers and IT operators easily deploy AI applications and solutions at the edge. Advancements also include the ability to simplify AI application development for faster time to value with the integration of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> inference microservices, deployment automation and more.</p>
<p>Huang discussed the concept of an AI factory, likening it to the factories of the last Industrial Revolution that used water to produce electricity. In the current Industrial Revolution, data centers act as AI factories, transforming data and electricity into valuable data tokens distributed globally.</p>
<p>“What has happened is instead of just producing software, we’re now producing intelligence — that intelligence is formulated in the form of tokens that can then be expressed in any information modality that we’d like it to be,” Huang explained.</p>
<p>Huang underscored the importance of full-stack accelerated computing to enable this, noting NVIDIA’s advancements.</p>
<p>Together, NVIDIA and Dell are providing the world’s industries with a full-stack offering — including computing, networking, storage, services and software — that drives copilots, coding assistants, virtual customer service agents and industrial digital twins.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/corporate/newsroom/announcements/detailpage.press-releases~usa~2024~05~20240520-dell-technologies-expands-dell-ai-factory-with-nvidia-to-turbocharge-ai-adoption.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1716246952240677&amp;usg=AOvVaw239ghwfccj07Z8HHelPXR6">Michael Dell introduced the latest innovations for the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA</a>, emphasizing their ability to simplify and accelerate customers’ AI journeys.</p>
<p>“We are unleashing this super genius power. Everyone is going to have access to this technology — and it&#8217;s gonna get smarter,” Dell said.</p>
<p>The Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA, announced earlier this year, offers a full stack of AI solutions from data center to edge, enabling organizations to quickly adopt and deploy AI at scale.</p>
<p>This platform integrates Dell’s AI capabilities with NVIDIA’s cutting-edge technologies, providing customers with an expansive AI portfolio and an open ecosystem of technology partners.</p>
<p>The Dell AI Factory, based on the NVIDIA partnership, will help establish <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-sovereign-ai/">AI sovereignty</a> for countries by enabling strong data security and customized AI service development.</p>
<p>Together, Dell and NVIDIA will bring these capabilities to companies, help stand it up, and help develop new applications that enterprises can deploy, Huang said.</p>
<p>“Our partnership between us is really about that, literally from the ground up building AI factories and delivering it to the world’s enterprises as a solution,” Huang said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Senior executives from NVIDIA, Siemens and Teradyne Robotics gathered this week in Odense, Denmark, to mark the launch of Teradyne Robotics’ new headquarters and discuss the massive advances coming to the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/robotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robotics industry</a>.</p>
<p>One of Denmark’s oldest cities and known as the city of robotics, Odense is home to over 160 robotics companies with 3,700 employees and contributes profoundly to the industry’s progress.</p>
<p>Teradyne Robotics’ new hub there, which includes cobot company Universal Robots (UR) and autonomous mobile robot (AMR) company MiR, is set to help employees maximize collaborative efforts, foster innovation and provide an environment to revolutionize advanced robotics and autonomous machines.</p>
<p>The grand opening showcased the latest AI robotic applications and featured a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llKhAC5ncfs">panel discussion</a> on the future of advanced robotics. Speakers included Ujjwal Kumar, group president at Teradyne Robotics; Rainer Brehm, CEO of Siemens Factory Automation; and Deepu Talla, vice president of robotics and edge computing at NVIDIA.</p>
<p>“The advent of generative AI coupled with simulation and digital twins technology is at a tipping point right now, and that combination is going to change the trajectory of robotics,” commented Talla.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Future of Advanced Robotics feat. NVIDIA, SIEMENS and TERADYNE" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/llKhAC5ncfs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>The Power of Partnerships</b></h2>
<p>The discussion comes as the global robotics market continues to grow rapidly. The <a href="https://statzon.com/insights/global-collaborative-robot-market">cobots market in Europe</a> was valued at $286 million in 2022 and is projected to reach $6.7 billion by 2032, at a yearly growth rate of more than 37%.</p>
<p>Panelists discussed why teaming up is key to innovation for any company — whether a startup or an enterprise — and how physical AI is being used across businesses and workplaces, stressing the game-changing impact of advanced robotics.</p>
<p>The alliance between NVIDIA and Teradyne Robotics, which includes an AI-based intra-logistics solution alongside Siemens, showcases the strength of collaboration across the ecosystem. NVIDIA’s prominent role as a physical AI hardware provider is boosting the cobot and AMR sectors with accelerated computing, while its collaboration with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/industrial-sector/siemens/">Siemens</a> is transforming industrial automation.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA provides all the core AI capabilities that get integrated into the hundreds and thousands of companies building robotic platforms and robots, so our approach is 100% collaboration,” Talla said.</p>
<p>“What excites me most about AI and robots is that collaboration is at the core of solving our customers’ problems,” Kumar added. “No one company has all the technologies needed to address these problems, so we must work together to understand and solve them at a very fast pace.”</p>
<h2><b>Accelerating Innovation With AI </b></h2>
<p>AI has already made huge strides across industries and plays an important role in enhancing advanced robotics. Leveraging machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing, AI gives robots the cognitive capability to understand, learn and make decisions.</p>
<p>“For humans, we have our senses, but it’s not that easy for a robot, so you have to build these AI capabilities for autonomous navigation,” Talla said. “<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA’s Isaac platform</a> is enabling increased autonomy in robotics with rapid advancements in simulation, generative AI, foundation models and optimized edge computing.”</p>
<p>NVIDIA is working closely with the UR team to infuse AI into UR’s robotics software technology. In the case of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/isaac-amr-nova-orin-autonomous-mobile-robots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">autonomous mobile robots</a> that move things from point A to B to C, it’s all about operating in unstructured environments and navigating autonomously.</p>
<p>Brehm emphasized the need to scale AI by industrializing it, allowing for automated deployment, inference and monitoring of models — making AI easily accessible on the shopfloor. He spoke about empowering customers to utilize AI effortlessly, even without AI expertise. “Our goal is to advance automation, moving towards a system that leverages skills-based automation in the future,” he said.</p>
<p>As a leading robotics company with one of the largest installed bases of collaborative and AMRs, Teradyne has identified a long list of industry problems and is working closely with NVIDIA to solve them.</p>
<p>“I use the term ‘physical AI’ as opposed to ‘digital AI’ because we are taking AI to a whole new level by applying it in the physical world,” said Kumar. “We see it helping our customers in three ways: adding new capabilities to our robots, making our robots smarter with advanced path planning and navigation, and further enhancing the safety and reliability of our collaborative robots.”</p>
<h2><b>The Impact of Real-World Robotics</b></h2>
<p>Autonomous machines, or AI robots, are already making a noticeable difference in the real world, from industries to our daily lives. Industries such as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/manufacturing/">manufacturing</a> are using advanced robotics to enhance efficiency, accuracy and productivity.</p>
<p>Companies want to produce goods close to where they are consumed, with sustainability being a key driver. But this often means setting up shop in high-cost countries. The challenge is twofold: producing at competitive prices and dealing with shrinking, aging workforces that are less available for factory jobs.</p>
<p>“The problem for large manufacturers is the same as what small and medium manufacturers have always faced: variability,” Kumar said. “High-volume industrial robots don’t suit applications requiring continuous design tweaks. Collaborative robots combined with AI offer solutions to the pain points that small and medium customers have lived with for years, and to the new challenges now faced by large manufacturers.”</p>
<p>Automation isn’t just about making things faster; it’s also about making the most of the workforce. In manufacturing, automation aids smoother processes, ramps up safety, saves time and relieves pressure on employees.</p>
<p>“Automation is crucial for solving problems and, to get there, AI is a game-changer. If you don’t have the people who want to work in the factory, and you don&#8217;t have the people to program the automation, you won’t have the flexibility to automate what you need in the future. And that’s what drives our customers,” Brehm said.</p>
<p>AI and computing technologies are set to redefine the robotics landscape, transforming robots from mere tools to intelligent partners capable of autonomy and adaptability across industries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>A collaboration between NVIDIA and academic researchers is prepping robots for surgery.</p>
<p>ORBIT-Surgical — developed by researchers from the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley, ETH Zurich, Georgia Tech and NVIDIA — is a simulation framework to train robots that could augment the skills of surgical teams while reducing surgeons’ cognitive load.</p>
<p>It supports more than a dozen maneuvers inspired by the training curriculum for laparoscopic procedures, aka minimally invasive surgery, such as grasping small objects like needles, passing them from one arm to another and placing them with high precision.</p>
<p>The physics-based framework was built using <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim">NVIDIA Isaac Sim</a>, a robotics simulation platform for designing, training and testing AI-based robots. The researchers trained reinforcement learning and imitation learning algorithms on NVIDIA GPUs and used <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform for developing and deploying advanced 3D applications and pipelines based on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description</a> (OpenUSD), to enable photorealistic rendering.</p>
<p>Using the community-supported da Vinci Research Kit, provided by the Intuitive Foundation, a nonprofit supported by robotic surgery leader Intuitive Surgical, the ORBIT-Surgical research team demonstrated how training a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-twin/">digital twin</a> in simulation transfers to a physical robot in a lab environment in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="ORBIT-Surgical: An Open-Simulation Framework for Learning Surgical Augmented Dexterity" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NA3xCRHcZsE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>ORBIT-Surgical will be <a href="https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/conferences/ICRA24/program/ICRA24_ContentListWeb_3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented Thursday at ICRA</a>, the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, taking place this week in Yokohama, Japan. The open-source code package is <a href="https://orbit-surgical.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2><b>A Stitch in AI Saves Nine</b></h2>
<p>ORBIT-Surgical is based on <a href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/isaac_gym_tutorials/ext_omni_isaac_orbit.html">Isaac Orbit</a>, a modular framework for robot learning built on Isaac Sim. Orbit includes support for various libraries for <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning-gpus-robotics/">reinforcement learning</a> and imitation learning, where AI agents are trained to mimic ground-truth expert examples.</p>
<p>The surgical framework enables developers to train robots like the da Vinci Research Kit robot, or dVRK, to manipulate both rigid and soft objects using reinforcement learning and imitation learning frameworks running on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/desktop-graphics/">NVIDIA RTX GPUs</a>.</p>
<p>ORBIT-Surgical introduces more than a dozen benchmark tasks for surgical training, including one-handed tasks such as picking up a piece of gauze, inserting a shunt into a blood vessel or lifting a suture needle to a specific position. It also includes two-handed tasks, like handing a needle from one arm to another, passing a threaded needle through a ring pole and reaching two arms to specific positions while avoiding obstacles.</p>
<div style="width: 1920px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-71604-1" width="1920" height="1080" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Shunt-Insertion_Real-Sim.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Shunt-Insertion_Real-Sim.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Shunt-Insertion_Real-Sim.mp4</a></video></div>
<p><em>One of ORBIT-Surgical&#8217;s benchmark tests is inserting a shunt — shown on left with a real-world robot and on right in simulation. </em></p>
<p>By developing a surgical simulator that takes advantage of GPU acceleration and parallelization, the team is able to boost robot learning speed by an order of magnitude compared to existing surgical frameworks. They found that the robot digital twin could be trained to complete tasks like inserting a shunt and lifting a suture needle in under two hours on a single NVIDIA RTX GPU.</p>
<p>With the visual realism enabled by rendering in Omniverse, ORBIT-Surgical also allows researchers to generate high-fidelity synthetic data, which could help train AI models for perception tasks such as segmenting surgical tools in real-world videos captured in the operating room.</p>
<p>A proof of concept by the team showed that combining simulation and real data significantly improved the accuracy of an AI model to segment surgical needles from images — helping reduce the need for large, expensive real-world datasets for training such models.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Mozilla Firefox, the popular open-source browser, is the latest partner to incorporate NVIDIA RTX Video, a technology that uses AI to improve video quality on Windows PCs and workstations. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><em>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </em><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>AI Decoded series</em></a><em>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and which showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.</em></p>
<p>Mozilla Firefox, the popular open-source browser, is the latest partner to incorporate NVIDIA RTX Video, a technology that uses AI to improve video quality on Windows PCs and workstations. The browser’s latest release taps local <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/desktop-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX GPUs</a> to make streaming and video better than ever.</p>
<h2><strong>Pixel Perfect</strong></h2>
<p>First announced at CES in January 2023, RTX Video is a collection of AI video enhancements that improve the quality of videos played on browsers through platforms like YouTube, Prime Video and Disney+. The technology makes videos streamed on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA GeForce RTX</a>-powered PCs and RTX-powered workstations appear sharper and more detailed without requiring a higher-resolution source.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Introducing RTX Video HDR: AI-Upscale Video to HDR Quality" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hlrk_qqqUNA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>RTX Video is made up of two parts. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-video-super-resolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Video Super Resolution</a> upscales low-resolution video for cleaner, crisper imagery. It works by analyzing the lower-resolution video and using deep learning to predict what the higher-resolution version should look like. The algorithm then combines this predicted image with a traditionally upscaled version to reduce or eliminate compression artifacts and sharpen the final output.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-video-hdr-remix-studio-driver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Video HDR</a> goes one step further: when enabled, it analyzes standard dynamic range (SDR) video content through AI neural networks to add high-dynamic range (HDR) information, improving visibility, details and vibrancy.</p>
<p>Since 90% of video online is 1080p or lower and SDR, enabling RTX Video is like pushing the “remaster” button on most of the content users watch everyday.</p>
<h2><strong>Pretty Foxy</strong></h2>
<p>Mozilla Firefox now supports RTX Video Super Resolution and HDR in its latest stable version (v126). It’s never been easier for users to access AI-enhanced upscaling, de-artifacting and HDR effects for online videos.</p>
<p>“Video is a core pillar of the modern web, and we are committed to delivering a great experience for our users,” said Bobby Holley, chief technology officer of Firefox at Mozilla. “Mozilla is integrating RTX Video into Firefox to improve video quality for our users with compatible GPUs.”</p>
<p>Firefox joins other Chromium-based browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, in supporting RTX Video. RTX Video Super Resolution is also supported in popular video players like VLC.</p>
<p>Enabling RTX Video is easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Update to the latest GeForce RTX Game Ready Driver, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/">NVIDIA Studio</a> or NVIDIA RTX Enterprise Driver.</li>
<li>Ensure Windows HDR features are enabled by navigating to System &gt; Display &gt; HDR.</li>
<li>Open the NVIDIA Control Panel and navigate to Adjust Video Image Settings &gt; RTX Video Enhancement.</li>
<li>Turn on “Super Resolution” and “High Dynamic Range.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that RTX Video HDR requires an NVIDIA GeForce RTX or RTX professional GPU connected to an HDR10-compatible monitor or TV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><span>Large language models that power generative AI are seeing intense innovation — models that handle multiple types of data such as text, image and sounds are becoming increasingly common. </span></p>
<p><span>However, building and deploying these models remains challenging. Developers need a way to quickly experience and evaluate models to determine the best fit for their use case, and then optimize the model for performance in a way that not only is cost-effective but offers the best performance.</span></p>
<p><span>To make it easier for developers to create AI-powered applications with world-class performance, NVIDIA and Google today announced three new collaborations at Google I/O ‘24. </span></p>
<h2><b>Gemma + NIM</b></h2>
<p><span>Using </span><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-supercharges-large-language-model-inference-on-nvidia-h100-gpus/"><span>TensorRT-LLM</span></a><span>, NVIDIA is working with Google to optimize two new models it introduced at the event: Gemma 2 and PaliGemma. These models are built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models, and each is focused on a specific area: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gemma 2 </b><span>is the next generation of Gemma models for a broad range of use cases and features a brand new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency.</span></li>
<li><b>PaliGemma</b><span> is an open vision language model (VLM) inspired by </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09199"><span>PaLI-3</span></a><span>. Built on open components including the SigLIP vision model and the Gemma language model, PaliGemma is designed for vision-language tasks such as image and short video captioning, visual question answering, understanding text in images, object detection and object segmentation. PaliGemma is designed for class-leading fine-tuning performance on a wide range of vision-language tasks and is also supported by </span><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/JAX-Toolbox"><span>NVIDIA JAX-Toolbox</span></a><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Gemma 2 and PaliGemma will be offered with </span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/"><span>NVIDIA NIM</span></a><span> inference microservices, part of the </span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/"><span>NVIDIA AI Enterprise</span></a><span> software platform, which simplifies the deployment of AI models at scale. NIM support for the two new models are available from the API catalog, starting with </span><a href="https://build.ngc.nvidia.com/google/google-paligemma"><span>PaliGemma</span></a><span> today; they soon will be released as containers on </span><a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/"><span>NVIDIA NGC</span></a><span> and GitHub. </span></p>
<h2><b>Bringing Accelerated Data Analytics to Colab</b></h2>
<p>Google also announced that <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/rapids-cudf-accelerates-pandas-nearly-150x-with-zero-code-changes/">RAPIDS cuDF, an open-source GPU dataframe library</a>, is now supported by default on Google Colab, one of the most popular developer platforms for data scientists. It now takes just a few seconds for <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/democratizing-access-to-ai-enabled-coding-with-colab/">Google Colab’s 10 million monthly users</a> to accelerate pandas-based Python workflows by up to 50x using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/l4/">NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, with zero code changes.</p>
<p>With RAPIDS cuDF, developers using Google Colab can speed up exploratory analysis and production data pipelines. While pandas is one of the world’s most popular data processing tools due to its intuitive API, applications often struggle as their data sizes grow. With even 5-10GB of data, many simple operations can take minutes to finish on a CPU, slowing down exploratory analysis and production data pipelines.</p>
<p>RAPIDS cuDF is designed to solve this problem by seamlessly accelerating pandas code on GPUs where applicable, and falling back to CPU-pandas where not. With RAPIDS cuDF available by default on Colab, all developers everywhere can leverage accelerated data analytics.</p>
<h2><b>Taking AI on the Road </b></h2>
<p>By employing AI PCs using NVIDIA RTX graphics, Google and NVIDIA also announced a Firebase Genkit collaboration that enables app developers to easily integrate generative AI models, like the new family of Gemma models, into their web and mobile applications to deliver custom content, provide semantic search and answer questions. Developers can start work streams using local RTX GPUs before moving their work seamlessly to Google Cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>To make this even easier, developers can build apps with Genkit using JavaScript, a programming language mobile developers commonly use to build their apps.</p>
<h2><b>The Innovation Beat Goes On</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA and Google Cloud are collaborating in multiple domains to propel AI forward. From the upcoming Grace Blackwell-powered DGX Cloud platform and JAX framework support, to bringing the NVIDIA NeMo framework to Google Kubernetes Engine, the companies’ full-stack partnership expands the possibilities of what customers can do with AI using NVIDIA technologies on Google Cloud.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Following an announcement by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, NVIDIA will play a central role in developing the nation’s generative AI infrastructure as Japan seeks to capitalize on the technology’s economic potential and further develop its workforce.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is collaborating with key digital infrastructure providers, including GMO Internet Group, Highreso, KDDI Corporation, RUTILEA, SAKURA internet Inc. and SoftBank Corp., which the ministry has certified to spearhead the development of cloud infrastructure crucial for AI applications.</p>
<p>Over the last two months, the ministry announced plans to allocate $740 million, approximately ¥114.6 billion, to assist six local firms in this initiative. Following on from last year, this is a significant effort by the Japanese government to subsidize AI computing resources, by expanding the number of companies involved.</p>
<p>With this move, Japan becomes the latest nation to embrace the concept of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-sovereign-ai/">sovereign AI</a>, aiming to fortify its local startups, enterprises and research efforts with advanced AI technologies.</p>
<p>Across the globe, nations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models. Some procure and operate sovereign AI clouds with state-owned <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/telecommunications/ai-factories/">telecommunications providers</a> or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public and private sector use.</p>
<p>Japan’s initiative follows NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang&#8217;s visit last year, where he met with political and business leaders — including Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida — to discuss the future of AI.</p>
<p>During his trip, Huang emphasized that “AI factories” — next-generation data centers designed to handle the most computationally intensive AI tasks — are crucial for turning vast amounts of data into intelligence. “The AI factory will become the bedrock of modern economies across the world,” Huang said during a meeting with the Japanese press in December.</p>
<p>The Japanese government plans to subsidize a significant portion of the costs for building AI supercomputers, which will facilitate AI adoption, enhance workforce skills, support Japanese language model development and bolster resilience against natural disasters and climate change.</p>
<p>Under the country’s Economic Security Promotion Act, the ministry aims to secure a stable supply of local cloud services, reducing the time and cost of developing next-generation AI technologies.</p>
<p>Japan’s technology powerhouses are already moving fast to embrace AI. Last week, SoftBank Corp. announced that it will invest ¥150 billion, approximately $960 million, for its plan to expand the infrastructure needed to develop Japan’s top-class AI, including purchases of NVIDIA accelerated computing.</p>
<p>The news follows Huang’s meetings with leaders in Canada, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam over the past year, as countries seek to supercharge their regional economies and embrace challenges such as climate change with AI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Described as the largest system in the pharmaceutical industry, BioHive-2 at the Salt Lake City headquarters of Recursion debuts today at No. 35, up more than 100 spots from its predecessor on the latest TOP500 list of the world’s fastest supercomputers.</p>
<p>The advance represents the company’s most recent effort to accelerate drug discovery with NVIDIA technologies.</p>
<p>“Just as with large language models, we see AI models in the biology domain improve performance substantially as we scale our training with more data and compute horsepower, which ultimately leads to greater impacts on patients’ lives,” said Recursion’s CTO, Ben Mabey, who’s been applying machine learning to healthcare for more than a decade.</p>
<p>BioHive-2 packs 504 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> linked on an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/">NVIDIA Quantum-2</a> InfiniBand network to deliver 2 exaflops of AI performance. The resulting <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD</a> is nearly 5x faster than Recursion’s first-generation system, BioHive-1.</p>
<h2><b>Performance Powers Through Complexity</b></h2>
<p>That performance is key to rapid progress because “biology is insanely complex,” Mabey said.</p>
<p>Finding a new drug candidate can take scientists years performing millions of wet-lab experiments.</p>
<p>That work is vital; Recursion’s scientists run more than 2 million such experiments a week. But going forward, they’ll use AI models on BioHive-2 to direct their platform to the most promising biology areas to run their experiments.</p>
<p>“With AI in the loop today, we can get 80% of the value with 40% of the wet lab work, and that ratio will improve going forward,” he said.</p>
<h2><b>Biological Data Propels Healthcare AI</b></h2>
<p>Recursion is collaborating with biopharma companies such as Bayer AG, Roche and Genentech. Over time, it also amassed a more than 50-petabyte database of biological, chemical and patient data, helping it build powerful AI models that are accelerating drug discovery.</p>
<p>“We believe it’s one of the largest biological datasets on Earth — it was built with AI training in mind, intentionally spanning biology and chemistry,” said Mabey, who joined the company more than seven years ago in part due to its commitment to building such a dataset.</p>
<h2><b>Creating an AI Phenomenon</b></h2>
<p>Processing that data on BioHive-1, Recursion developed a family of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/">foundation models</a> called Phenom. They turn a series of microscopic cellular images into meaningful representations for understanding the underlying biology.</p>
<p>A member of that family, <a href="https://www.recursion.com/news/nothing-short-of-phenomenal-new-deep-learning-model-available-on-nvidias-bionemo-platform">Phenom-Beta</a>, is now available as a cloud API and the first third-party model on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a>, a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> platform for drug discovery.</p>
<p>Over several months of research and iteration, BioHive-1 trained <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10242">Phenom-1</a> using more than 3.5 billion cellular images. Recursion’s expanded system enables training even more powerful models with larger datasets in less time.</p>
<p>The company also used <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a>, hosted by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, to provide additional supercomputing resources to power their work.</p>
<figure id="attachment_71588" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71588" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-71588" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation-672x338.gif" alt="Animation of how Recursion trains AI models for drug discovery on NVIDIA GPUs" width="672" height="338" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation-672x338.gif 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation-400x201.gif 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation-768x386.gif 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation-842x423.gif 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation-406x204.gif 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recursion-Phenom-AI-model-animation-188x94.gif 188w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-71588" class="wp-caption-text">Much like how LLMs are trained to generate missing words in a sentence, Phenom models are trained by asking them to generate the masked out pixels in images of cells.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Phenom-1 model serves Recursion and its partners in several ways, including finding and optimizing molecules to treat a variety of diseases and cancers. Earlier models helped Recursion predict drug candidates for COVID-19 nine out of 10 times.</p>
<p>The company announced its <a href="https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-announces-collaboration-and-50-million-investment">collaboration with NVIDIA</a> in July. Less than 30 days later, the combination of BioHive-1 and DGX Cloud <a href="https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-bridges-protein-and-chemical-space-massive-protein">screened and analyzed</a> a massive chemical library to predict protein targets for approximately 36 billion chemical compounds.</p>
<p>In January, the company <a href="https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-unveils-lowe-drug-discovery-software-jp-morgan">demonstrated</a> LOWE, an AI workflow engine with a natural-language interface to help make its tools more accessible to scientists. And in April it <a href="https://portal.valencelabs.com/blogs/post/introducing-molgps---a-foundational-gnn-for-molecular-property-prediction-Ti4InC3788me9f5">described</a> a billion-parameter AI model it built to provide a new way to predict the properties of key molecules of interest in healthcare.</p>
<p>Recursion uses NVIDIA software to optimize its systems.</p>
<p>“We love CUDA and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a>, and we’re looking to see if <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> can help us distribute our models more easily, both internally and to partners,” he said.</p>
<h2><b>A Shared Vision for Healthcare</b></h2>
<p>The efforts are part of a broad vision that Jensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO, described in a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ceo-ai-drug-discovery-jp-morgan-healthcare-2024/">fireside chat</a> with Recursion’s chairman as moving toward simulating biology.</p>
<p>“You can now recognize and learn the language of almost anything with structure, and you can translate it to anything with structure … This is the generative AI revolution,” Huang said.</p>
<p>“We share a similar view,” said Mabey.</p>
<p>“We are in the early stages of a very interesting time where just as computers accelerated chip design, AI can speed up drug design. Biology is much more complex, so it will take years to play out, but looking back, people will see this was a real turning point in healthcare,” he added.</p>

Scientific computing and physics-based simulations are poised to make giant steps across domains that benefit humanity as advances in accelerated computing and AI drive the world’s next big breakthroughs.</p>
<p>NVIDIA unveiled at GTC in March <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing">the NVIDIA Blackwell platform</a>, which promises generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models (LLMs) at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than the NVIDIA Hopper architecture.</p>
<p>Blackwell has powerful implications for AI workloads, and its technology capabilities can also help to deliver discoveries across all types of scientific computing applications, including traditional numerical simulation.</p>
<p>By reducing energy costs, accelerated computing and AI drive <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/sustainable-computing/">sustainable computing</a>. Many scientific computing applications already benefit. Weather can be simulated at 200x lower cost and with 300x less energy, while digital twin simulations have 65x lower cost and 58x less energy consumption versus traditional CPU-based systems and others.</p>
<h2><b>Multiplying Scientific Computing Simulations With Blackwell</b></h2>
<p>Scientific computing and physics-based simulation often rely on what’s known as double-precision formats, or <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/double-precision-tensor-cores/">FP64 (floating point</a>), to solve problems. <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-blackwell-architecture">Blackwell GPUs</a> deliver 30% more FP64 and FP32 FMA (fused multiply-add) performance  than Hopper.</p>
<p>Physics-based simulations are critical to product design and development. From planes and trains to bridges, silicon chips and pharmaceuticals — testing and improving products in simulation saves researchers and developers billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Today application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are designed almost exclusively on CPUs in a long and complex workflow, including analog analysis to identify voltages and currents.</p>
<p>But that’s changing. The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/industrial-sector/cadence/">Cadence</a> SpectreX simulator is one example of an analog circuit design solver. SpectreX circuit simulations are projected to run 13x quicker on a GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip — which connects Blackwell GPUs and Grace CPUs — than on a traditional CPU.</p>
<p>Also, GPU-accelerated computational fluid dynamics, or CFD, has become a key tool. Engineers and equipment designers use it to predict the behavior of designs. Cadence Fidelity runs CFD simulations that are projected to run as much as 22x faster on GB200 systems than on traditional CPU-powered systems. With parallel scalability and 30TB of memory per GB200 NVL72 rack, it’s possible to capture flow details like never before.</p>
<p>In another application, Cadence Reality’s digital twin software can be used to create a virtual replica of a physical data center, including all its components — servers, cooling systems and power supplies. Such a virtual model allows engineers to test different configurations and scenarios before implementing them in the real world, saving time and costs.</p>
<p>Cadence Reality’s magic happens from physics-based algorithms that can simulate how heat, airflow and power usage affect data centers. This helps engineers and data center operators to more effectively manage capacity, predict potential operational problems and make informed decisions to optimize the layout and operation of the data center for improved efficiency and capacity utilization. With Blackwell GPUs, these simulations are projected to run up to 30x faster than with CPUs, offering accelerated timelines and higher energy efficiency.</p>

<h2><b>AI for Scientific Computing</b></h2>
<p>New Blackwell accelerators and networking will deliver leaps in performance for advanced simulation.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA GB200 kicks off a new era for high-performance computing (HPC). Its architecture sports a second-generation transformer engine optimized to accelerate inference workloads for LLMs.</p>
<p>This delivers a 30x speedup on resource-intensive applications like the 1.8-trillion-parameter GPT-MoE (generative pretrained transformer-mixture of experts) model compared to the H100 generation, unlocking new possibilities for HPC. By enabling LLMs to process and decipher vast amounts of scientific data, HPC applications can sooner reach valuable insights that can accelerate scientific discovery.</p>
<p>Sandia National Laboratories <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-science-isc/">is building</a> an LLM copilot for parallel programming. Traditional AI can generate basic serial computing code efficiently, but when it comes to parallel computing code for HPC applications, LLMs can falter. Sandia researchers are tackling this issue head-on with an ambitious project — automatically generating parallel code in Kokkos, a specialized programming language designed by multiple national labs for running tasks across tens of thousands of processors in the world’s most powerful supercomputers.</p>
<p>Sandia is using an AI technique known as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, or RAG, which combines information-retrieval capabilities with language generation models. The team is creating a Kokkos database and integrating it with AI models using RAG.</p>
<p>Initial results are promising. Different RAG approaches from Sandia have demonstrated autonomously generated Kokkos code for parallel computing applications. By overcoming hurdles in AI-based parallel code generation, Sandia aims to unlock new possibilities in HPC across leading supercomputing facilities worldwide. Other examples <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/ai-for-a-scientific-computing-revolution/">include</a> renewables research, climate science and drug discovery.</p>

<h2><b>Driving Quantum Computing Advances</b></h2>
<p>Quantum computing unlocks a time machine trip for fusion energy, climate research, drug discovery and many more areas. So researchers are hard at work simulating future quantum computers on NVIDIA GPU-based systems and software to develop and test quantum algorithms faster than ever.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introducing-cuda-quantum-the-platform-for-hybrid-quantum-classical-computing/">NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform</a> enables both simulation of quantum computers and hybrid application development with a unified programming model for CPUs, GPUs and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-qpu/">QPUs</a> (quantum processing units) working together.</p>
<p>CUDA-Q is speeding simulations in chemistry workflows for BASF, high-energy and nuclear physics for Stony Brook and quantum chemistry for NERSC.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Blackwell architecture will help drive quantum simulations to new heights. Utilizing the latest NVIDIA NVLink multi-node interconnect technology helps shuttle data faster for speedup benefits to quantum simulations.</p>
<h2><b>Accelerating Data Analytics for Scientific Breakthroughs </b></h2>
<p>Data processing with RAPIDS is popular for scientific computing. Blackwell introduces a hardware decompression engine to decompress compressed data and speed up analytics in RAPIDS.</p>
<p>The decompression engine provides performance improvements up to 800GB/s and enables Grace Blackwell to perform 18x faster than CPUs — on Sapphire Rapids — and 6x faster than NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs for query benchmarks.</p>
<p>Rocketing data transfers with 8TB/s of high-memory bandwidth and the Grace CPU high-speed NVLink Chip-to-Chip (C2C) interconnect, the engine speeds up the entire process of database queries. Yielding top-notch performance across data analytics and data science use cases, Blackwell speeds data insights and reduces costs.</p>

<h2><b>Driving Extreme Performance for Scientific Computing with NVIDIA Networking</b></h2>
<p>The NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand networking platform offers the highest throughput for scientific computing infrastructure.</p>
<p>It includes NVIDIA Quantum Q3400 and Q3200 switches and the NVIDIA ConnectX-8 SuperNIC, together hitting twice the bandwidth of the prior generation. The Q3400 platform offers 5x higher bandwidth capacity and 14.4Tflops of in-network computing with NVIDIA’s scalable hierarchical aggregation and reduction protocol (SHARPv4), providing a 9x increase compared with the prior generation.</p>
<p>The performance leap and power efficiency translates to significant reductions in workload completion time and energy consumption for scientific computing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Generative AI is taking root at national and corporate labs, accelerating high-performance computing for business and science.</p>
<p>Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories aim to automatically <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/advanced-ai-and-retrieval-augmented-generation-for-code-development-in-high-performance-computing/">generate code in Kokkos</a>, a parallel programming language designed for use across many of the world’s largest supercomputers.</p>
<p>It’s an ambitious effort. The specialized language, developed by researchers from several national labs, handles the nuances of running tasks across tens of thousands of processors.</p>
<p>Sandia is employing retrieval-augmented generation (<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">RAG</a>) to create and link a Kokkos database with AI models. As researchers experiment with different RAG approaches, initial tests show promising results.</p>
<p>Cloud-based services like <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/translate-your-enterprise-data-into-actionable-insights-with-nvidia-nemo-retriever/">NeMo Retriever</a> are among the RAG options the scientists will evaluate.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA provides a rich set of tools to help us significantly accelerate the work of our HPC software developers,” said Robert Hoekstra, a senior manager of extreme scale computing at Sandia.</p>
<p>Building copilots via model tuning and RAG is just a start. Researchers eventually aim to employ foundation models trained with scientific data from fields such as climate, biology and material science.</p>
<h2><b>Getting Ahead of the Storm</b></h2>
<p>Researchers and companies in weather forecasting are embracing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15214">CorrDiff</a>, a generative AI model that’s part of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/high-performance-computing/earth-2/">NVIDIA Earth-2</a>, a set of services and software for weather and climate research.</p>
<p>CorrDiff can scale the 25km resolution of traditional atmosphere models down to 2 kilometers and expand by more than 100x the number of forecasts that can be combined to improve confidence in predictions.</p>
<p>“It’s a promising innovation … We plan to leverage such models in our global and regional AI forecasts for richer insights,” said Tom Gowan, machine learning and modeling lead for Spire, a company in Vienna, Va., that collects data from its own network of tiny satellites.</p>
<p>Generative AI enables faster, more accurate forecasts, he said in a recent <a href="https://spire.com/blog/weather-climate/ai-weather-modeling-spire-and-nvidia-partnership/">interview</a>.</p>
<p>“It really feels like a big jump in meteorology,” he added. “And by partnering with NVIDIA, we have access to the world’s best GPUs that are the most reliable, fastest and most efficient ones for both training and inference.”</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-71561" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast-672x410.jpg" alt="Graphic showing Spire weather forecast" width="672" height="410" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast-672x410.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast-400x244.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast-768x469.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast-737x450.jpg 737w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast-352x215.jpg 352w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast-164x100.jpg 164w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spire-weather-forecast.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>Switzerland-based Meteomatics recently <a href="https://www.meteomatics.com/en/news/meteomatics-nvidia-ai-based-weather-forecasts/">announced</a> it also plans to use NVIDIA’s generative AI platform for its weather forecasting business.</p>
<p>“Our work with NVIDIA will help energy companies maximize their renewable energy operations and increase their profitability with quick and accurate insight into weather fluctuations,” said Martin Fengler, founder and CEO of Meteomatics.</p>
<h2><b>Generating Genes to Improve Healthcare</b></h2>
<p>At Argonne National Laboratory, scientists are using the technology to generate gene sequences that help them better understand the virus behind COVID-19. Their award-winning models, called GenSLMs, spawned simulations that closely resemble real-world variants of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>“Understanding how different parts of the genome are co-evolving gives us clues about how the virus may develop new vulnerabilities or new forms of resistance,” Arvind Ramanathan, a lead researcher, said in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-covid-genome-sequences/">a blog</a>.</p>
<p>GenSLMs were trained on more than 110 million genome sequences with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU</a>-powered supercomputers, including Argonne’s <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-turbocharges-extreme-scale-ai-for-argonne-national-laboratorys-polaris-supercomputer">Polaris</a> system, the U.S. Department of Energy’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nersc-perlmutter-ai-supercomputer/">Perlmutter</a> and NVIDIA’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/making-selene-pandemic-ai/">Selene</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Microsoft Proposes Novel Materials</b></h2>
<p>Microsoft Research showed how generative AI can accelerate work in materials science.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/mattergen-property-guided-materials-design/">MatterGen</a> model generates novel, stable materials that exhibit desired properties. The approach enables specifying chemical, magnetic, electronic, mechanical and other desired properties.</p>
<p>“We believe MatterGen is an important step forward in AI for materials design,” the Microsoft Research team wrote of the model they trained on Azure AI infrastructure with NVIDIA A100 GPUs.</p>
<p>Companies such as <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/using-graph-neural-networks-for-additive-manufacturing/">Carbon3D</a> are already finding opportunities, applying generative AI to materials science in commercial 3D printing operations.</p>
<p>It’s just the beginning of what researchers will be able to do for HPC and science with generative AI. The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h200/">NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs</a> available now and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/">NVIDIA Blackwell Architecture GPUs</a> will take their work to new levels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Data centers need an upgraded dashboard to guide their journey to greater <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/energy-efficiency/">energy efficiency</a>, one that shows progress running real-world applications.</p>
<p>The formula for energy efficiency is simple: work done divided by energy used. Applying it to data centers calls for unpacking some details.</p>
<p>Today’s most widely used gauge — power usage effectiveness (<a href="https://leonardo-energy.pl/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Green_Grid_Metrics.pdf">PUE</a>)  — compares the total energy a facility consumes to the amount its computing infrastructure uses. Over the last 17 years, PUE has driven the most efficient operators closer to an ideal where almost no energy is wasted on processes like power conversion and cooling.</p>
<h2><b>Finding the Next Metrics</b></h2>
<p>PUE served data centers well during the rise of cloud computing, and it will continue to be useful. But it’s insufficient in today’s <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> era, when workloads and the systems running them have changed dramatically.</p>
<p>That’s because PUE doesn’t measure the useful output of a data center, only the energy that it consumes. That’d be like measuring the amount of gas an engine uses without noticing how far the car has gone.</p>
<p>Many standards exist for data center efficiency. A<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7921551"> 2017 paper</a> lists nearly three dozen of them, several focused on specific targets such as cooling, water use, security and cost.</p>
<h2><b>Understanding What’s Watts</b></h2>
<p>When it comes to energy efficiency, the computer industry has a long and somewhat unfortunate history of describing systems and the processors they use in terms of power, typically in watts. It’s a worthwhile metric, but many fail to realize that watts only measure input power at a point in time, not the actual energy computers use or how efficiently they use it.</p>
<p>So, when modern systems and processors report rising input power levels in watts, that doesn’t mean they’re less energy efficient. In fact, they’re often much more efficient in the amount of work they do with the amount of energy they use.</p>
<p>Modern data center metrics should focus on energy, what the engineering community knows as kilowatt-hours or joules. The key is how much useful work they do with this energy.</p>
<h2><b>Reworking What We Call Work</b></h2>
<p>Here again, the industry has a practice of measuring in abstract terms, like processor instructions or math calculations. So, MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and FLOPS (floating point operations per second) are widely quoted.</p>
<p>Only computer scientists care how many of these low-level jobs their system can handle. Users would prefer to know how much real work their systems put out, but defining useful work is somewhat subjective.</p>
<p>Data centers focused on AI may rely on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/mlperf-benchmarks/">MLPerf benchmarks</a>. Supercomputing centers tackling scientific research typically use <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-application-performance">additional measures</a> of work. Commercial data centers focused on streaming media may want others.</p>
<p>The resulting suite of applications must be allowed to evolve over time to reflect the state of the art and the most relevant use cases. For example, the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tensorrt-llm-inference-mlperf/">last MLPerf round</a> added tests using two generative AI models that didn’t even exist five years ago.</p>
<h2><b>A Gauge for Accelerated Computing</b></h2>
<p>Ideally, any new benchmarks should measure advances in<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/"> accelerated computing</a>. This combination of parallel processing hardware, software and methods is running applications dramatically faster and more efficiently than CPUs across many modern workloads.</p>
<p>For example, on scientific applications, the Perlmutter supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gpu-energy-efficiency-nersc/">demonstrated</a> an average of 5x gains in energy efficiency using accelerated computing. That’s why it’s among the 39 of the top 50 supercomputers — including the No. 1 system — on<a href="https://www.top500.org/lists/green500/2023/11/"> the Green500 list</a> that use NVIDIA GPUs.</p>

<p>Companies across many industries share similar results. For example, PayPal improved real-time fraud detection by 10% and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/gpu-inference-momentum-continues-to-build/">lowered server energy consumption</a> nearly 8x with accelerated computing.</p>
<p>The gains are growing with each new generation of GPU hardware and software.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/HAI_AI-Index-Report_2023.pdf">recent report</a>, Stanford University’s Human-Centered AI group estimated GPU performance “has increased roughly 7,000 times” since 2003, and price per performance is “5,600 times greater.”</p>

<h2><b>Two Experts Weigh In</b></h2>
<p>Experts see the need for a new energy-efficiency metric, too.</p>
<p>With today’s data centers achieving scores around 1.2 PUE, the metric “has run its course,” said Christian Belady, a data center engineer who had the original idea for PUE. “It improved data center efficiency when things were bad, but two decades later, they’re better, and we need to focus on other metrics more relevant to today’s problems.”</p>
<p>Looking forward, “the holy grail is a performance metric. You can’t compare different workloads directly, but if you segment by workloads, I think there is a better likelihood for success,” said Belady, who continues to work on initiatives driving data center sustainability.</p>
<p>Jonathan Koomey, a researcher and author on computer efficiency and sustainability, agreed.</p>
<p>“To make good decisions about efficiency, data center operators need a suite of benchmarks that measure the energy implications of today’s most widely used AI workloads,” said Koomey.</p>
<p>“Tokens per joule is a great example of what one element of such a suite might be,” Koomey added. “Companies will need to engage in open discussions, share information on the nuances of their own workloads and experiments, and agree to realistic test procedures to ensure these metrics accurately characterize energy use for hardware running real-world applications.”</p>
<p>“Finally, we need an open public forum to conduct this important work,” he said.</p>
<h2><b>It Takes a Village</b></h2>
<p>Thanks to metrics like PUE and rankings like the Green500, data centers and supercomputing centers have made enormous progress in energy efficiency.</p>
<p>More can and must be done to extend efficiency advances in the age of generative AI. Metrics of energy consumed doing useful work on today’s top applications can take supercomputing and data centers to a new level of energy efficiency.</p>
