										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Enhancing Japan’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-sovereign-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI sovereignty</a> and strengthening its research and development capabilities, Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) will integrate thousands of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h200/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA H200</a> Tensor Core GPUs into its AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure 3.0 supercomputer (ABCI 3.0). The HPE Cray XD system will feature <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Quantum-2</a> InfiniBand networking for superior performance and scalability.</p>
<p>ABCI 3.0 is the latest iteration of Japan’s large-scale Open AI Computing Infrastructure designed to advance AI R&amp;D. This collaboration underlines Japan’s commitment to advancing its AI capabilities and fortifying its technological independence.</p>
<p>“In August 2018, we launched ABCI, the world’s first large-scale open AI computing infrastructure,” said AIST Executive Officer Yoshio Tanaka. “Building on our experience over the past several years managing ABCI, we’re now upgrading to ABCI 3.0. In collaboration with NVIDIA we aim to develop ABCI 3.0 into a computing infrastructure that will advance further research and development capabilities for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> in Japan.”</p>
<p>“As generative AI prepares to catalyze global change, it’s crucial to rapidly cultivate research and development capabilities within Japan,” said AIST Solutions Co. Producer and Head of ABCI Operations Hirotaka Ogawa. “I’m confident that this major upgrade of ABCI in our collaboration with NVIDIA and HPE will enhance ABCI’s leadership in domestic industry and academia, propelling Japan towards global competitiveness in AI development and serving as the bedrock for future innovation.”</p>

<h2><strong>ABCI 3.0: A New Era for Japanese AI Research and Development</strong></h2>
<p>ABCI 3.0 is constructed and operated by AIST, its business subsidiary, AIST Solutions, and its system integrator, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).</p>
<p>The ABCI 3.0 project follows support from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, known as METI, for strengthening its computing resources through the Economic Security Fund and is part of a broader $1 billion initiative by METI that includes both ABCI efforts and investments in cloud AI computing.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is closely <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/japan-sovereign-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaborating with METI</a> on research and education following a visit last year by company founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, who met with political and business leaders, including Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, to discuss the future of AI.</p>
<h2><strong>NVIDIA’s Commitment to Japan’s Future</strong></h2>
<p>Huang pledged to collaborate on research, particularly in generative AI, robotics and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-quantum-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum computing</a>, to invest in AI startups and provide product support, training and education on AI.</p>
<p>During his visit, Huang emphasized that “AI factories” — next-generation data centers designed to handle the most computationally intensive AI tasks — are crucial for turning vast amounts of data into intelligence.</p>
<p>“The AI factory will become the bedrock of modern economies across the world,” Huang said during a meeting with the Japanese press in December.</p>
<p>With its ultra-high-density data center and energy-efficient design, ABCI provides a robust infrastructure for developing AI and big data applications.</p>
<p>The system is expected to come online by the end of this year and offer state-of-the-art AI research and development resources. It will be housed in Kashiwa, near Tokyo.</p>
<h2><strong>Unmatched Computing Performance and Efficiency</strong></h2>
<p>The facility will offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 AI <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-an-exaflop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exaflops</a> of computing capacity, a measure of AI-specific performance without sparsity</li>
<li>410 double-precision petaflops, a measure of general computing capacity</li>
<li>Each node is connected via the Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform at 200GB/s of bisectional bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
<p>NVIDIA technology forms the backbone of this initiative, with hundreds of nodes each equipped with 8 NVLlink-connected H200 GPUs providing unprecedented computational performance and efficiency.</p>
<p>NVIDIA H200 is the first GPU to offer over 140 gigabytes (GB) of HBM3e memory at 4.8 terabytes per second (TB/s). The H200’s larger and faster memory accelerates generative AI and LLMs, while advancing scientific computing for HPC workloads with better energy efficiency and lower total cost of ownership.</p>
<p>NVIDIA H200 GPUs are 15X more energy-efficient than ABCI’s previous-generation architecture for AI workloads such as LLM token generation.</p>
<p>The integration of advanced NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand with In-Network computing — where networking devices perform computations on data, offloading the work from the CPU — ensures efficient, high-speed, low-latency communication, crucial for handling intensive AI workloads and vast datasets.</p>
<p>ABCI boasts world-class computing and data processing power, serving as a platform to accelerate joint AI R&amp;D with industries, academia and governments.</p>
<p>METI’s substantial investment is a testament to Japan’s strategic vision to enhance AI development capabilities and accelerate the use of generative AI.</p>
<p>By subsidizing AI supercomputer development, Japan aims to reduce the time and costs of developing next-generation AI technologies, positioning itself as a leader in the global AI landscape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> is captivating imaginations and transforming industries. Behind the scenes, an unsung hero is making it all possible: microservices architecture.</p>
<h2><b>The Building Blocks of Modern AI Applications</b></h2>
<p>Microservices have emerged as a powerful architecture, fundamentally changing how people design, build and deploy software.</p>
<p>A microservices architecture breaks down an application into a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a specific capability and communicates with other services through well-defined application programming interfaces, or APIs. This modular approach stands in stark contrast to traditional all-in-one architectures, in which all functionality is bundled into a single, tightly integrated application.</p>
<p>By decoupling services, teams can work on different components simultaneously, accelerating development processes and allowing updates to be rolled out independently without affecting the entire application. Developers can focus on building and improving specific services, leading to better code quality and faster problem resolution. Such specialization allows developers to become experts in their particular domain.</p>
<p>Services can be scaled independently based on demand, optimizing resource utilization and improving overall system performance. In addition, different services can use different technologies, allowing developers to choose the best tools for each specific task.</p>
<h2><b>A Perfect Match: Microservices and Generative AI</b></h2>
<p>The microservices architecture is particularly well-suited for developing generative AI applications due to its scalability, enhanced modularity and flexibility.</p>
<p>AI models, especially <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language models</a>, require significant computational resources. Microservices allow for efficient scaling of these resource-intensive components without affecting the entire system.</p>
<p>Generative AI applications often involve multiple steps, such as data preprocessing, model inference and post-processing. Microservices enable each step to be developed, optimized and scaled independently. Plus, as AI models and techniques evolve rapidly, a microservices architecture allows for easier integration of new models as well as the replacement of existing ones without disrupting the entire application.</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA NIM: Simplifying Generative AI Deployment</b></h2>
<p>As the demand for AI-powered applications grows, developers face challenges in efficiently deploying and managing AI models.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM inference microservices</a> provide models as optimized containers to deploy in the cloud, data centers, workstations, desktops and laptops. Each NIM container includes the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-pretrained-ai-model/">pretrained AI models</a> and all the necessary runtime components, making it simple to integrate AI capabilities into applications.</p>
<p>NIM offers a game-changing approach for application developers looking to incorporate AI functionality by providing simplified integration, production-readiness and flexibility. Developers can focus on building their applications without worrying about the complexities of data preparation, model training or customization, as NIM inference microservices are optimized for performance, come with runtime optimizations and support industry-standard APIs.</p>
<h2><b>AI at Your Fingertips: NVIDIA NIM on Workstations and PCs</b></h2>
<p>Building enterprise generative AI applications comes with many challenges. While cloud-hosted model APIs can help developers get started, issues related to data privacy, security, model response latency, accuracy, API costs and scaling often hinder the path to production.</p>
<p>Workstations with NIM provide developers with secure access to a broad range of models and performance-optimized inference microservices.</p>
<p>By avoiding the latency, cost and compliance concerns associated with cloud-hosted APIs as well as the complexities of model deployment, developers can focus on application development. This accelerates the delivery of production-ready generative AI applications — enabling seamless, automatic scale out with performance optimization in data centers and the cloud.</p>
<p>The recently announced general availability of the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/llama-3-nim-healthcare-generative-ai/">Meta Llama 3 8B model as a NIM</a>, which can run locally on RTX systems, brings state-of-the-art language model capabilities to individual developers, enabling local testing and experimentation without the need for cloud resources. With NIM running locally, developers can create sophisticated <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</a> projects right on their workstations.</p>
<p>Local RAG refers to implementing RAG systems entirely on local hardware, without relying on cloud-based services or external APIs.</p>
<p>Developers can use the Llama 3 8B NIM on workstations with one or more <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-6000/">NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation GPUs</a> or on NVIDIA RTX systems to build end-to-end RAG systems entirely on local hardware. This setup allows developers to tap the full power of Llama 3 8B, ensuring high performance and low latency.</p>
<p>By running the entire RAG pipeline locally, developers can maintain complete control over their data, ensuring privacy and security. This approach is particularly helpful for developers building applications that require real-time responses and high accuracy, such as customer-support chatbots, personalized content-generation tools and interactive virtual assistants.</p>
<p>Hybrid RAG combines local and cloud-based resources to optimize performance and flexibility in AI applications. With <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/">NVIDIA AI Workbench</a>, developers can get started with the hybrid-RAG Workbench Project — an example application that can be used to run vector databases and embedding models locally while performing inference using NIM in the cloud or data center, offering a flexible approach to resource allocation.</p>
<p>This hybrid setup allows developers to balance the computational load between local and cloud resources, optimizing performance and cost. For example, the vector database and embedding models can be hosted on local workstations to ensure fast data retrieval and processing, while the more computationally intensive inference tasks can be offloaded to powerful cloud-based NIM inference microservices. This flexibility enables developers to scale their applications seamlessly, accommodating varying workloads and ensuring consistent performance.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a> NIM inference microservices bring digital humans, AI non-playable characters (NPCs) and interactive avatars for customer service to life with generative AI, running on RTX PCs and workstations.</p>
<p>ACE NIM inference microservices for speech — including Riva automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech and neural machine translation — allow accurate transcription, translation and realistic voices.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA Nemotron small language model is a NIM for intelligence that includes INT4 quantization for minimal memory usage and supports roleplay and RAG use cases.</p>
<p>And ACE NIM inference microservices for appearance include Audio2Face and Omniverse RTX for lifelike animation with ultrarealistic visuals. These provide more immersive and engaging gaming characters, as well as more satisfying experiences for users interacting with virtual customer-service agents.</p>
<h2><b>Dive Into NIM</b></h2>
<p>As AI progresses, the ability to rapidly deploy and scale its capabilities will become increasingly crucial.</p>
<p>NVIDIA NIM microservices provide the foundation for this new era of AI application development, enabling breakthrough innovations. Whether building the next generation of AI-powered games, developing advanced <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/natural-language-processing/">natural language processing</a> applications or creating intelligent automation systems, users can access these powerful development tools at their fingertips.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Artificial intelligence is transforming the transportation industry, helping drive advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology.</p>
<p>Waabi, a Toronto-based startup, is embracing generative AI to deliver self-driving vehicles at scale — starting with the long-haul trucking sector.</p>
<p>At GTC in March, <a href="https://waabi.ai/nvidia-drivethor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waabi announced that it will use the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor</a> centralized car computer to bring a safe, generative AI-powered autonomous trucking solution — the Waabi Driver —  to market.</p>
<p>As the company plans the launch of fully driverless operations next year, Waabi is reinvigorating the industry with a self-driving solution that’s capital-efficient, can safely handle new scenarios on the road and ultimately scales commercially.</p>
<p>Waabi is developing on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/drive/os" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DRIVE OS</a>, the company’s operating system for safe, AI-defined autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>The innovative startup has pioneered an approach that centers on the combination of two generative AI systems: a “teacher,” called Waabi World, an advanced simulator that trains and validates a “student,” called Waabi Driver, a single, end-to-end AI system that’s capable of human-like reasoning and is fully interpretable.</p>
<p>When paired together, these systems reduce the need for extensive on-road testing and enable a safer, more efficient solution that is highly performant and scalable.</p>
<p>“We are excited to have a deep collaboration with NVIDIA to bring generative AI to the edge, on our vehicles, at scale,” said Raquel Urtasun, founder and CEO of Waabi.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Waabi and NVIDIA: Bringing Generative AI to the Edge" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iDGwP45B_GA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Generative AI accelerates the development of AVs by “providing an end-to-end system where, instead of requiring hundreds of engineers to develop a system by hand, it provides the ability to learn foundation models that can run unsupervised by observing and acting on the world,” Urtasun added.</p>
<p>Waabi’s collaboration with NVIDIA is one in a series of milestones, including the company’s <a href="https://waabi.ai/waabi-series-b-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million Series B round</a> with participation from NVIDIA, its <a href="https://waabi.ai/waabi-uber-freight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with logistics company Uber Freight</a>, the launch of its first commercial autonomous trucking routes in the U.S., and the opening of a trucking terminal near Dallas to serve as the center of the company’s operations in the Lone Star state.</p>
<p>“What we’re building for autonomous vehicles — combining generative AI-powered simulation with a foundation AI model purpose-built for acting in the physical world — will enable faster, safer and more scalable deployment of this transformative technology around the world,” Urtasun noted on the company’s website.</p>
<p><i>Listen to Urtasun’s </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62621/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>talk at GTC</i></a><i> for more on the company’s work on using generative AI to develop autonomous vehicles.</i></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Generative models have completely transformed the AI landscape — headlined by popular apps such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>AI Decoded series</i></a><i>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.</i></p>
<p>Generative models have completely transformed the AI landscape — headlined by popular apps such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion.</p>
<p>Paving the way for this boom were foundational AI models and generative adversarial networks (GANs), which sparked a leap in productivity and creativity.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gaugan-photorealistic-landscapes-nvidia-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GauGAN</a>, which powers the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/canvas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Canvas app</a>, is one such model that uses AI to transform rough sketches into photorealistic artwork.</p>
<h2><b>How It All BeGAN</b></h2>
<p>GANs are deep learning models that involve two complementary neural networks: a generator and a discriminator.</p>
<p>These neural networks compete against each other. The generator attempts to create realistic, lifelike imagery, while the discriminator tries to tell the difference between what’s real and what’s generated. As its neural networks keep challenging each other, GANs get better and better at making realistic-looking samples.</p>
<p>GANs excel at understanding complex data patterns and creating high-quality results. They&#8217;re used in applications including image synthesis, style transfer, data augmentation and image-to-image translation.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s GauGAN, named after post-Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, is an AI demo for photorealistic image generation. Built by NVIDIA Research, it directly led to the development of the NVIDIA Canvas app — and can be experienced for free through the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/ai-demos/">NVIDIA AI Playground</a>.</p>
<p>GauGAN has been wildly popular since it debuted at NVIDIA GTC in 2019 — used by art teachers, creative agencies, museums and millions more online.</p>
<h2><b>Giving Sketch to Scenery a Gogh</b></h2>
<p>Powered by GauGAN and local <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX GPUs</a>, NVIDIA Canvas uses AI to turn simple brushstrokes into realistic landscapes, displaying results in real time.</p>
<p>Users can start by sketching simple lines and shapes with a palette of real-world elements like grass or clouds —- referred to in the app as “materials.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA Canvas: New Update | 4x Higher Resolution &amp; 5 New Materials" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wKztRskmsig?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The AI model then generates the enhanced image on the other half of the screen in real time. For example, a few triangular shapes sketched using the “mountain” material will appear as a stunning, photorealistic range. Or users can select the “cloud” material and with a few mouse clicks transform environments from sunny to overcast.</p>
<p>The creative possibilities are endless — sketch a pond, and other elements in the image, like trees and rocks, will reflect in the water. Change the material from snow to grass, and the scene shifts from a cozy winter setting to a tropical paradise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>On a weekday afternoon, Ashwini Ashtankar sat on the bank of the Doodhpathri River, in a valley nestled in the Himalayas. Taking a deep breath, she noticed that there was no city noise, no pollution — and no work emails.</p>
<p>Ashtankar, a senior tools development engineer in NVIDIA’s Pune, India, office, took advantage of the company’s free days — two extra days off per quarter when the whole company disconnects from work — to recharge. Free days are fully paid by NVIDIA, not counted as vacation or as personal time off, and are in addition to country-specific holidays and time-away programs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-72789" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Snow_Peak_Sonmarg-672x378.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Snow_Peak_Sonmarg-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Snow_Peak_Sonmarg-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Snow_Peak_Sonmarg-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Snow_Peak_Sonmarg-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Snow_Peak_Sonmarg-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Snow_Peak_Sonmarg-800x450.jpg 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Snow_Peak_Sonmarg-382x215.jpg 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Snow_Peak_Sonmarg-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Snow_Peak_Sonmarg-1280x720.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></p>
<p>Free days give employees time to take an adventure, a breather — or both. Ashtankar and her husband, Dipen Sisodia — also an NVIDIAN — spent it outdoors, hiking up a mountain, playing in snow and exploring forests and lush green meadows.</p>
<p>“My free days give me time to focus on myself and recharge,” said Ashtankar. “We didn’t take our laptops. We were able to completely disconnect, like all NVIDIANs were doing at the same time.”</p>

<p>Ashtankar returned to work feeling refreshed and recharged, she said. Her team tests software features of NVIDIA products, focusing on GPU display drivers and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/">GeForce NOW</a> game-streaming service, to make sure bugs are found and addressed before a product reaches customers.</p>
<p>“I take pride in tackling challenges with the highest level of quality and creativity, all in support of delivering the best products to our customers,” she said. “To do that, sometimes the most productive thing we can do is rest and let the soul catch up with the body.”</p>
<p>Ashtankar plans to build her career at NVIDIA for many years to come.</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard of another company that truly cares this much about its employees,” she said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[SyncTwin’s application enables teams to optimize industrial efficiency while enhancing sustainability across manufacturing processes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of </i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/news/"><i>Into the Omniverse</i></a><i>, a series focused on how technical artists, developers and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advances in </i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>OpenUSD</i></a><i> and </i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>NVIDIA Omniverse</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<p>Efficiency and sustainability are critical for organizations looking to be at the forefront of industrial innovation.</p>
<p>To address the digitalization needs of manufacturing and other industries, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.synctwin.ai/">SyncTwin </a>GmbH — a company that builds software to optimize production, intralogistics and assembly — developed a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/">digital twin</a> app using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/cuopt/">NVIDIA cuOpt</a>, an accelerated optimization engine for solving complex routing problems, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform of application programming interfaces, software development kits and services that enable developers to build <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">OpenUSD</a>-based applications.</p>
<p>SyncTwin is harnessing the power of the extensible OpenUSD framework for describing, composing, simulating, and collaborating within 3D worlds to help its customers create physically accurate digital twins of their factories. The digital twins can be used to optimize production and enhance digital precision to meet industrial performance.</p>
<h2><b>OpenUSD’s Role in Modern Manufacturing</b></h2>
<p>Manufacturing workflows are incredibly complex, making effective communication and integration across various domains pivotal to ensuring operational efficiency. The SyncTwin app provides seamless collaboration capabilities for factory plant managers and their teams, enabling them to optimize processes and resources.</p>
<p>The app uses OpenUSD and Omniverse to help make factory planning and operations easier and more accessible by integrating various manufacturing aspects into a cohesive digital twin. Customers can integrate visual data, production details, product catalogs, orders, schedules, resources and production settings <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/transforming-microsoft-xls-and-ppt-files-into-a-factory-digital-twin-with-openusd/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1720024234143097&amp;usg=AOvVaw3pcW7Wfq_o95dh5vj0UF4S">from a variety of file formats all in one place with OpenUSD</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-72746 aligncenter" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/synctwin_blog_steps_app_2.png" alt="" width="816" height="440" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/synctwin_blog_steps_app_2.png 1928w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/synctwin_blog_steps_app_2-400x216.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/synctwin_blog_steps_app_2-672x362.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/synctwin_blog_steps_app_2-768x414.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/synctwin_blog_steps_app_2-1536x829.png 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/synctwin_blog_steps_app_2-834x450.png 834w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/synctwin_blog_steps_app_2-399x215.png 399w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/synctwin_blog_steps_app_2-185x100.png 185w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/synctwin_blog_steps_app_2-1280x690.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" /></p>
<p>The SyncTwin app creates realistic, virtual environments that facilitate seamless interactions between different sectors of factory operations. This capability enables diverse data—including floorplans from Microsoft PowerPoint and warehouse container data from Excel spreadsheets — to be aggregated in a unified digital twin.</p>
<p>The flexibility of OpenUSD allows for non-destructive editing and composition of complex 3D assets and animations, further enhancing the digital twin.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[NVIDIA Broadcast offers AI-powered features that improve audio and video quality for a variety of use cases.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/"><i>AI Decoded series</i></a><i>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.</i></p>
<p>AI has changed computing forever. The spotlight has most recently been on generative AI, but AI-accelerated, NVIDIA RTX-powered tools have also been key in improving gaming, content creation and productivity over the years.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/">NVIDIA Broadcast app</a> is one example, using Tensor Cores on a local RTX GPU to seamlessly improve audio and video quality. Paired with the NVIDIA encoder (<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-codec-sdk">NVENC</a>) built into GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs, the app makes it easy to get started as a livestreamer or to look professional during video conference calls.</p>
<h2><b>The Stream Dream</b></h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Broadcasting With NVIDIA GeForce RTX | NVENC vs x264 Quality Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/viWuC4MMXWc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>High-quality livestreaming traditionally required expensive hardware. Many livestreamers relied on software CPU encoding using the x264 software library, which often impacted gameplay quality. This led many to use a dual-PC setup, with one PC focused on gaming and content and the other on encoding the stream. It was complicated to assemble, difficult to troubleshoot and often cost-prohibitive for budding livestreamers.</p>
<p>NVENC is here to help. It’s a dedicated hardware video encoder on NVIDIA GPUs that processes the encoding, freeing up the rest of the system to focus on game and content performance. Industry-leading streaming apps like Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) are adding support for NVENC, paving the way for a new generation of broadcasters on popular platforms like Twitch and YouTube.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/maxine">NVIDIA Maxine</a> helps solve the issue of expensive equipment. It includes free, AI-powered features like virtual green screens and webcam-based augmented reality tracking that eliminate the need for special equipment like physical green screens or motion- capture suits. Broadcasters first got to experience the technology at TwitchCon 2019, where they tested OBS live on the show floor with an AI-accelerated green screen on a GeForce RTX 2080 GPU.</p>
<p>Maxine’s AI-powered effects debuted for RTX users in the RTX Voice beta, and moved into the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/">NVIDIA Broadcast</a> app.</p>
<h2><b>Now Showing: NVIDIA Broadcast</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA Broadcast offers AI-powered features that improve audio and video quality for a variety of use cases. It’s user-friendly, works in any app and is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/broadcast-app-setup-guide/#Quick-Start-Guide">breeze to set up</a>.</p>
<p>It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Noise and Acoustic Echo Removal:</b> AI eliminates unwanted background noise from both the mic and inbound audio at the touch of a button.</li>
<li><b>Virtual Backgrounds:</b> Features like Background Removal, Replacement and Blur help customize backgrounds without the need for expensive equipment or complex lighting setups.</li>
<li><b>Eye Contact: </b>AI helps make it appear as though a streamer is looking directly at the camera, even when they’re glancing off camera or taking notes.</li>
<li><b>Auto Frame: </b>Dynamically tracks movements in real time, automatically cropping and zooming moving objects regardless of their position.</li>
<li><b>Vignette:</b> AI applies a darkening effect to the corners of camera images, providing visual contrast to draw attention to the center of the video and adding stylistic flair.</li>
<li><b>Video Noise Removal:</b> Removes visual noise from low-light situations for a cleaner picture.</li>
</ul>
<p>NVIDIA Broadcast works by creating a virtual camera, microphone or speaker in Windows so that users can set up their devices once and use them in any broadcasting, video conferencing or voice chat apps, including Discord, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, OBS Studio, Slack, Webex and Zoom.</p>
<p>Those with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX, TITAN RTX, NVIDIA RTX or Quadro RTX GPU can use their GPU’s dedicated Tensor Cores to help the app’s AI networks run in real time.</p>
<p>The same AI-powered technology in NVIDIA Broadcast is also available to app developers as a software development kit. Audiovisual technology company Elgato includes Maxine’s AI audio noise removal technology in its <a target="_blank" href="https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/7665204543117-Wave-Link-How-to-use-NVIDIA-Broadcast-Noise-Removal-by-Elgato">Wave Link</a> software, while VTube Studio — a popular app for connecting a 3D model to a webcam for streaming as an animated character — offers an <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178540/VTube_Studio__NVIDIA_Broadcast_Tracker/">RTX-accelerated model tracker</a> plug-in as a free download. Independent developer Xaymar uses NVIDIA Maxine in his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xaymar.com/projects/voicefx/">VoiceFX</a> plug-in.</p>
<p>Content creators can use this plug-in or Elgato’s virtual studio technology (VST) filter to clean up noise and echo from recordings in post-processing in video editing suites like Adobe Premiere Pro or in digital audio workstations like Ableton Live and Adobe Audition.</p>
<h2><b>(Not) Hearing Is Believing</b></h2>
<p>Since its release, NVIDIA Broadcast has been used by millions.</p>
<p>“I’ve utilized the video noise removal and background replacement the most,” said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/mr_vudoo">Mr_Vudoo</a>, a Twitch personality and broadcaster. “The eye contact feature was very interesting and quite honestly took me by surprise at how well it worked.”</p>
<p>Unmesh Dinda, host of the YouTube channel <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@PiXimperfect/featured">PiXimperfect</a>, demonstrated NVIDIA Broadcast’s noise-canceling and echo-removal AI features in an extreme scenario. He set an electric fan whirring directly into his microphone and donned a helmet that was intensely hammered on. Even with these loud sounds in the background, Dinda could be heard crystal clear with Broadcast’s noise-removal feature turned on. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/ClTp4_Hp867/?hl=en">The video</a> has racked up more than 12 million views.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Remove ALL Background Noise with One Click! #Shorts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEurXLfzXfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA Broadcast is also a useful tool for the growing remote workforce. In an article, Tom’s Hardware editor-in-chief Avram Piltch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-broadcast-tested">detailed his testing</a> of the app’s noise reduction features against noisy air conditioners, lawn-mowing neighbors and even a robot-wielding, tantrum-throwing child. Broadcast’s AI audio filters prevailed every time:</p>
<p>“I got my eight-year-old to fake throwing a fit right behind me and, once I enabled noise removal, every whine of ‘I’m not going to bed’ went silent (at least on the recording),” said Piltch. “To double the challenge, we had him throw a tantrum while carrying around a robot car with whirring treads. Once again, NVIDIA Broadcast removed all of the unwanted sound.”</p>
<p>Even everyday scenarios like video calls with a medical professional benefit from NVIDIA Broadcast’s AI-powered background removal.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today I was video calling my doctor and she complimented me on how good the background blurring on my webcam looked.</p>

<p>The startup, which emerged from the Meta FAIR (Fundamental AI Research) unit, recently landed funding led by Lux Capital, Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, with investment from NVIDIA and Amazon.</p>
<p>At the forefront of programmable biology, EvolutionaryScale can assist researchers in engineering proteins that can help target cancer cells, find alternatives to harmful plastics, drive environmental mitigations and more.</p>
<p>EvolutionaryScale is pioneering the frontier of programmable biology with the scale-out model development of ESM3, which used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> for the most compute ever put into a biological foundation model. The 98 billion parameter ESM3 model uses roughly 25x more flops and 60x more data than its predecessor, ESM2.</p>
<p>The company, which developed a database of more than 2 billion protein sequences to train its AI model, offers technology that can provide clues applicable to drug development, disease eradication and, literally, how humans have evolved at scale as a species — as its name suggests — for drug discovery researchers.</p>
<h2><b>Accelerating In Silico Biological Research With ESM3</b></h2>
<p>With leaps in training data, EvolutionaryScale aims to accelerate protein discovery with ESM3.</p>
<p>The model was trained on almost 2.8 billion protein sequences sampled from organisms and biomes, allowing scientists to prompt the model to identify and validate new proteins with increasing levels of accuracy.</p>
<p>ESM3 offers significant updates over previous versions. The model is natively generative, and it is an “all to all” model, meaning structure and function annotations can be provided as input rather than just as output.</p>
<p>Once it’s made publicly available, scientists can fine-tune this base model to construct purpose-built models based on their own proprietary data. The boost in protein engineering capabilities due to ESM3’s large-scale generative training across enormous amounts of data offers a time-traveling machine for in silico biological research.</p>
<h2><b>Driving the Next Big Breakthroughs With NVIDIA BioNeMo</b></h2>
<p>ESM3 provides biologists and protein designers with a generative AI boost, helping improve their engineering and understanding of proteins. With simple prompts, it can generate new proteins with a provided scaffold, self-improve its protein design based on feedback and design proteins based on the functionality that the user indicates. These capabilities can be used in tandem in any combination to provide chain-of-thought protein design as if the user were messaging a researcher who had memorized the intricate three-dimensional meaning of every protein sequence known to humans and had learned the language fluently, enabling users to iterate back and forth.</p>
<p>“In our internal testing we’ve been impressed by the ability of ESM3 to creatively respond to a variety of complex prompts,” said Tom Sercu, co-founder and VP of engineering at EvolutionaryScale. “It was able to solve an extremely hard protein design problem to create a novel Green Fluorescent Protein. We expect ESM3 will help scientists accelerate their work and open up new possibilities — we’re looking forward to seeing how it will contribute to future research in the life sciences.”</p>
<p>EvolutionaryScale will be opening an API for closed beta today and code and weights are available for a small open version of ESM3 for non-commercial use. This version is coming soon to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a>, a generative AI platform for drug discovery. The full ESM3 family of models will soon be available to select customers as an <a target="_blank" href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.avanan.click%2Fv2%2F___https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fai%2F%2523referrer%3Dai-subdomain%3Fncid%3Dpa-srch-goog-772333%26_bt%3D697697685508%26_bk%3Dnvidia%2520nim%26_bm%3De%26_bn%3Dg%26_bg%3D165151891361%26gad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMI5pHT7fvjhgMVVXN_AB1KOQFuEAAYASAAEgKvWfD_BwE___.YXAzOm91dGNhc3Q6YTpvOjViNjRiMzE4MDU2MWMwZDcyNThmMmI4NWZhYTViNTJiOjY6NDI2ZTphZWVjMmY1N2JjMjFiM2NhODBiNmFmMjFiZTM2YTQyZWM1NDMwZTZhODdmZTYwOWEyZGRiODc2MWJlMGY2MzUxOmg6VA&amp;data=05%7C02%7Crkelleher%40nvidia.com%7C789b16235c954beed3a908dc8ff9ab8b%7C43083d15727340c1b7db39efd9ccc17a%7C0%7C0%7C638543549716443890%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=wD96MHFHOJjySVQjvo%2FqotZ6KMUZX7Lcr%2FMHAbyGW%2FU%3D&amp;reserved=0">NVIDIA NIM</a> microservice, run-time optimized in collaboration with NVIDIA, and supported by an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software license for testing at ai.nvidia.com.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Multi-die chips, known as three-dimensional integrated circuits, or 3D-ICs, represent a revolutionary step in semiconductor design. The chips are vertically stacked to create a compact structure that boosts performance without increasing power consumption.</p>
<p>However, as chips become denser, they present more complex challenges in managing electromagnetic and thermal stresses. To understand and address this, advanced 3D multiphysics visualizations become essential to design and diagnostic processes.</p>
<p>At this week’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dac.com/">Design Automation Conference</a>, a global event showcasing the latest developments in chips and systems, Ansys — a company that develops engineering simulation and 3D design software — will share how it’s using NVIDIA technology to overcome these challenges to build the next generation of semiconductor systems.</p>
<p>To enable 3D visualizations of simulation results for their users, Ansys uses <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform of application programming interfaces, software development kits, and services that enables developers to easily integrate <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)</a> and NVIDIA RTX rendering technologies into existing software tools and simulation workflows.</p>
<p>The platform powers visualizations of 3D-IC results from Ansys solvers so engineers can evaluate phenomena like electromagnetic fields and temperature variations to optimize chips for faster processing, increased functionality and improved reliability.</p>
<p>With Ansys Icepak on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform, engineers can simulate temperatures across a chip according to different power profiles and floor plans. Finding chip hot-spots can lead to better design of the chips themselves, as well as auxiliary cooling devices. However, these 3D-IC simulations are computationally intensive, limiting the number of simulations and design points users can explore.</p>
<p>Using <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus">NVIDIA Modulus, combined with</a> novel techniques for handling arbitrary power patterns in the Ansys RedHawk-SC electrothermal data pipeline and model training framework, the Ansys R&amp;D team is exploring the acceleration of simulation workflows with AI-based surrogate models. Modulus is an open-source AI framework for building, training and fine-tuning physics-ML models at scale with a simple Python interface.</p>
<p>With the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/modulus-v2209/user_guide/theory/architectures.html">NVIDIA Modulus Fourier neural operator </a>(FNO) architecture, which can parameterize solutions for a distribution of partial differential equations, Ansys researchers created an AI surrogate model that efficiently predicts temperature profiles for any given power profile and a given floor plan defined by system parameters like heat transfer coefficient, thickness and material properties. This model offers near real-time results at significantly reduced computational costs, allowing Ansys users to explore a wider design space for new chips.</p>
<figure id="attachment_72730" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72730" style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ansys-Copy.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-72730 size-full" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ansys-Copy.png" alt="" width="399" height="133" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ansys-Copy.png 399w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ansys-Copy-188x63.png 188w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-72730" class="wp-caption-text">Ansys uses a 3D FNO model to infer temperatures on a chip surface for unseen power profiles, a given die height and heat-transfer coefficient boundary condition.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Following a successful proof of concept, the Ansys team will explore integration of such AI surrogate models for its next-generation RedHawk-SC platform using NVIDIA Modulus.</p>
<p>As more surrogate models are developed, the team will also look to enhance model generality and accuracy through in-situ fine-tuning. This will enable RedHawk-SC users to benefit from faster simulation workflows, access to a broader design space and the ability to refine models with their own data to foster innovation and safety in product development.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[NVIDIA AI Workbench simplifies AI developer workflows by helping users build their own RAG projects, customize models and more.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/"><i>AI Decoded series</i></a><i>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible and showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for NVIDIA RTX PC and workstation users.</i></p>
<p>The demand for tools to simplify and optimize <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> development is skyrocketing. Applications based on <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</a> — a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with facts fetched from specified external sources — and customized models are enabling developers to tune AI models to their specific needs.</p>
<p>While such work may have required a complex setup in the past, new tools are making it easier than ever.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/">NVIDIA AI Workbench</a> simplifies AI developer workflows by helping users build their own RAG projects, customize models and more. It’s part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/streamline-ai-powered-app-development-with-nvidia-rtx-ai-toolkit-for-windows-rtx-pcs/">RTX AI Toolkit</a> — a suite of tools and software development kits for customizing, optimizing and deploying AI capabilities — launched at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/computex/">COMPUTEX</a> earlier this month. AI Workbench removes the complexity of technical tasks that can derail experts and halt beginners.</p>
<h2><b>What Is NVIDIA AI Workbench?</b></h2>
<p>Available for free, NVIDIA AI Workbench enables users to develop, experiment with, test and prototype AI applications across GPU systems of their choice — from laptops and workstations to data center and cloud. It offers a new approach for creating, using and sharing GPU-enabled development environments across people and systems.</p>
<p>A simple <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/installation/overview.html">installation</a> gets users up and running with AI Workbench on a local or remote machine in just minutes. Users can then start a new project or replicate one from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nvidia?q=workbench&amp;type=all&amp;language=&amp;sort">the examples on GitHub</a>. Everything works through GitHub or GitLab, so users can easily collaborate and distribute work. Learn more about <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/overview/introduction.html">getting started with AI Workbench</a>.</p>
<h2><b>How AI Workbench Helps Address AI Project Challenges</b></h2>
<p>Developing AI workloads can require manual, often complex processes, right from the start.</p>
<p>Setting up GPUs, updating drivers and managing versioning incompatibilities can be cumbersome. Reproducing projects across different systems can require replicating manual processes over and over. Inconsistencies when replicating projects, like issues with data fragmentation and version control, can hinder collaboration. Varied setup processes, moving credentials and secrets, and changes in the environment, data, models and file locations can all limit the portability of projects.</p>
<p>AI Workbench makes it easier for data scientists and developers to manage their work and collaborate across heterogeneous platforms. It integrates and automates various aspects of the development process, offering:<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ease of setup:</b> AI Workbench streamlines the process of setting up a developer environment that’s GPU-accelerated, even for users with limited technical knowledge.</li>
<li><b>Seamless collaboration: </b>AI Workbench integrates with version-control and project-management tools like GitHub and GitLab, reducing friction when collaborating.</li>
<li><b>Consistency when scaling from local to cloud:</b> AI Workbench ensures consistency across multiple environments, supporting scaling up or down from local workstations or PCs to data centers or the cloud.<b></b></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>RAG for Documents, Easier Than Ever</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA offers sample development <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/overview/projects.html">Workbench Projects</a> to help users get started with AI Workbench. The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/workbench-example-hybrid-rag">hybrid RAG Workbench Project</a> is one example: It runs a custom, text-based RAG web application with a user’s documents on their local workstation, PC or remote system.</p>
<p>Every Workbench Project runs in a “container” — software that includes all the necessary components to run the AI application. The hybrid RAG sample pairs a Gradio chat interface frontend on the host machine with a containerized RAG server — the backend that services a user’s request and routes queries to and from the vector database and the selected <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language model</a>.</p>
<p>This Workbench Project supports a wide variety of LLMs <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/workbench-example-hybrid-rag?tab=readme-ov-file#table-1-default-supported-models-by-inference-mode">available on NVIDIA’s GitHub page</a>. Plus, the hybrid nature of the project lets users select where to run inference.</p>
<figure id="attachment_72265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72265" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-72265" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-672x382.png" alt="" width="672" height="382" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-672x382.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-400x228.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-768x437.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-791x450.png 791w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-378x215.png 378w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-176x100.png 176w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects-1280x728.png 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/git-based-projects.png 1413w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-72265" class="wp-caption-text">Workbench Projects let users version the development environment and code.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Developers can run the embedding model on the host machine and run inference locally on a Hugging Face Text Generation Inference server, on target cloud resources using NVIDIA inference endpoints like the <a target="_blank" href="http://build.nvidia.com">NVIDIA API catalog</a>, or with self-hosting microservices such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> or third-party services.</p>
<p>The hybrid RAG Workbench Project also includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Performance metrics:</b> Users can evaluate how RAG- and non-RAG-based user queries perform across each inference mode. Tracked metrics include Retrieval Time, Time to First Token (TTFT) and Token Velocity.</li>
<li><b>Retrieval transparency:</b> A panel shows the exact snippets of text — retrieved from the most contextually relevant content in the vector database — that are being fed into the LLM and improving the response’s relevance to a user’s query.</li>
<li><b>Response customization:</b> Responses can be tweaked with a variety of parameters, such as maximum tokens to generate, temperature and frequency penalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get started with this project, simply <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/">install AI Workbench</a> on a local system. The hybrid RAG Workbench Project can be brought from GitHub into the user’s account and duplicated to the local system.</p>
<p>More resources are available in the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/quickstart/example-projects.html">AI Decoded user guide</a>. In addition, community members provide helpful video tutorials, like the one from Joe Freeman below.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA AI Workbench Topology running on Windows, WSL and Linux  with an example" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTA3D4LJfc0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Customize, Optimize, Deploy</b></h2>
<p>Developers often seek to customize AI models for specific use cases. Fine-tuning, a technique that changes the model by training it with additional data, can be useful for style transfer or changing model behavior. AI Workbench helps with fine-tuning, as well.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/RTX-AI-Toolkit/blob/main/tutorial-llama3-finetune.md">Llama-factory AI Workbench Project</a> enables QLoRa, a fine-tuning method that minimizes memory requirements, for a variety of models, as well as model quantization via a simple graphical user interface. Developers can use public or their own datasets to meet the needs of their applications.</p>
<p>Once fine-tuning is complete, the model can be quantized for improved performance and a smaller memory footprint, then deployed to native Windows applications for local inference or to NVIDIA NIM for cloud inference. Find a complete tutorial for this project on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/RTX-AI-Toolkit">NVIDIA RTX AI Toolkit repository</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Truly Hybrid — Run AI Workloads Anywhere</b></h2>
<p>The Hybrid-RAG Workbench Project described above is hybrid in more than one way. In addition to offering a choice of inference mode, the project can be run locally on NVIDIA RTX workstations and GeForce RTX PCs, or scaled up to remote cloud servers and data centers.</p>
<p>The ability to run projects on systems of the user’s choice — without the overhead of setting up the infrastructure — extends to all Workbench Projects.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>The electric grid and the utilities managing it have an important role to play in the next industrial revolution that’s being driven by AI and accelerated computing, said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang Tuesday at the annual meeting of the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), an association of U.S. and international utilities.</p>
<p>“The future of digital intelligence is quite bright, and so the future of the energy sector is bright, too,” said Huang in a conversation before an audience of more than a thousand utility and energy industry executives.</p>
<p>Like other companies, utilities will apply AI to increase employee productivity, but “the greatest impact and return is in applying AI in the delivery of energy over the grid,” said Huang, in conversation with Pedro Pizarro, the chair of EEI and president and CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, one of the nation’s largest electric utilities.</p>
<p>For example, Huang described how grids will use AI-powered smart meters to let customers sell their excess electricity to neighbors.</p>
<p>“You will connect resources and users, just like Google, so your power grid becomes a smart network with a digital layer like an app store for energy,” he said.</p>
<p>“My sense is, like previous industrial revolutions, [AI] will drive productivity to levels that we’ve never seen,” he added.</p>
<h2><b>AI Lights Up Electric Grids</b></h2>
<p>Today, electric grids are mainly one-way systems that link a few big power plants to many users. They’ll increasingly become two-way, flexible and distributed networks with solar and wind farms connecting homes and buildings that sport solar panels, batteries and electric vehicle chargers.</p>
<p>It’s a big job that requires autonomous control systems that process and analyze in real time a massive amount of data — work well suited to AI and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/">accelerated computing</a>.</p>
<p>AI is being applied to use cases across electric grids, thanks to a wide ecosystem of companies using NVIDIA’s technologies.</p>
<p>In a recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s61864/">GTC session</a>, utility vendor Hubbell and startup Utilidata, a member of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a> program, described a new generation of smart meters using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a> platform that utilities will deploy to process and analyze real-time grid data using AI models at the edge. Deloitte <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deloitte-and-utilidata-establish-first-of-its-kind-collaboration-to-revolutionize-the-us-power-grid-for-a-sustainable-future-302175120.html">announced</a> today its support for the effort.</p>
<p>Siemens Energy detailed in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62524/">a separate GTC session</a> its work with AI and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> creating digital twins of transformers in substations to improve predictive maintenance, boosting grid resilience. And <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-energy-utilities/maximize-wind-energy">a video</a> reports on how Siemens Gamesa used Omniverse and accelerated computing to optimize turbine placements for a large wind farm.</p>
<p>“Deploying AI and advanced computing technologies developed by NVIDIA enables faster and better grid modernization and we, in turn, can deliver for our customers,” said Maria Pope, CEO of Portland General Electric in Oregon.</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA Delivers 45,000x Gain in Energy Efficiency</b></h2>
<p>The advances come as NVIDIA drives down the costs and energy needed to deploy AI.</p>
<p>Over the last eight years, NVIDIA increased <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/energy-efficiency/">energy efficiency</a> of running AI inference on state-of-the-art large language models a whopping 45,000x, Huang said in his recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKXDVsWZmUU">keynote</a> at COMPUTEX.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/">NVIDIA Blackwell architecture GPUs</a> will provide 20x greater energy efficiency than CPUs for AI and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/high-performance-computing/">high-performance computing</a>. If all CPU servers for these jobs transitioned to GPUs, users would save 37 terawatt-hours a year, the equivalent of 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and the electricity use of 5 million homes.</p>
<p>That’s why NVIDIA-powered systems swept the top six spots and took seven of the top 10 in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/green500-energy-efficient-supercomputers/">the latest ranking</a> of the <a target="_blank" href="https://top500.org/lists/green500/2024/06/">Green500</a>, a list of the world’s most energy-efficient supercomputers.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-energy-study/">a recent report</a> calls for governments to accelerate adoption of AI as a significant new tool to drive energy efficiency across many industries. It cited examples of utilities adopting AI to make the electric grid more efficient.</p>
