										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA today was named the world‚Äôs most innovative company by <i>Fast Company</i> magazine.</p>
<p>The accolade comes on the heels of company founder and CEO Jensen Huang being inducted into the U.S. National Academy of Engineering.</p>
<p>A team of several dozen journalists at <i>Fast Company</i> ‚Äî a business media brand launched in 1995 by two <i>Harvard Business Review</i> editors ‚Äî ranked NVIDIA the leader in its <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/list">2024 list</a> of the world‚Äôs 50 most innovative companies.</p>
<h2><b>‚ÄúPutting AI to Work‚Äù</b></h2>
<p>‚ÄúNvidia isn‚Äôt just in the business of providing ever-more-powerful computing hardware and letting everybody else figure out what to do with it,‚Äù <i>Fast Company</i> wrote in <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91033514/nvidia-most-innovative-companies-2024">an article</a> detailing its selection.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAcross an array of industries, the company‚Äôs technologies, platforms, and partnerships are doing much of the heavy lifting of putting AI to work,‚Äù citing advances in automotive, drug discovery, gaming and retail announced in one recent week.</p>
<p>The article noted the central role of the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/about-cuda">CUDA</a> compute platform. It also shared an eye-popping experience using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> to interact with a digital twin of a Nissan Z sport coupe.</p>
<h2><b>In a League With Giants</b></h2>
<p>‚ÄúEven for AI‚Äôs titans, building on what Nvidia has created ‚Äî the more ambitiously, the better ‚Äî is often how progress happens,‚Äù the article concluded.</p>
<p>Last year, OpenAI led the list for ChatGPT, the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models">large language model</a> that started a groundswell in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>. In 2021, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech topped the ranking for rapidly developing a Covid vaccine.</p>
<p><i>Fast Company</i> bases its ranking on four criteria: innovation, impact, timeliness and relevance. Launched in 2008, the annual list recognizes organizations that have introduced groundbreaking products, fostered positive social impact and reshaped industries.</p>
<p>NVIDIA invented the GPU in 1999, redefining computer graphics and igniting the era of modern AI. NVIDIA is now driving the platform shift to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/">accelerated computing</a> and generative AI, transforming the world‚Äôs largest industries.</p>
<h2><b>Fueling an AI Revolution</b></h2>
<p>Last month, Huang was elected to the National Academy of Engineering (<a href="https://www.nae.edu/">NAE</a>) for contributions in ‚Äúhigh-powered graphics processing units, fueling the artificial intelligence revolution.‚Äù</p>
<p>Academy membership honors those who have made outstanding contributions such as pioneering new fields of technology. Founded in 1964, the NAE provides a trusted source of engineering advice for creating a healthier, more secure and sustainable world.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJensen Huang‚Äôs induction into the National Academy of Engineering is a testament to his enduring contributions to our industry and world,‚Äù said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHis visionary leadership has forever transformed computing, from the broad adoption of advanced 3D graphics to today‚Äôs GPUs ‚Äî and, more importantly, has driven foundational innovations across every sector, from gaming and productivity, to digital biology and healthcare. All of us at Microsoft congratulate Jensen on this distinction, and we are honored to partner with him and the entire NVIDIA team on defining this new era of AI,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJensen‚Äôs election is incredibly well deserved,‚Äù said John Hennessy, president emeritus of Stanford University and an NAE member since 1992.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHis election recognizes both his transformative technical contributions, as well as his incredible leadership of NVIDIA for almost 30 years. I have seen many NAE nominations over the past 30 years, Jensen‚Äôs was one of the best!‚Äù</p>
<p>Morris Chang, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and an NAE member since 2002, added his congratulations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJensen is one of the most visionary engineers and charismatic business leaders I have had the pleasure to work with in the last three decades,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Huang is also a recipient of the Semiconductor Industry Association‚Äôs highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award, as well as honorary doctorate degrees from Taiwan‚Äôs National Chiao Tung University, National Taiwan University and Oregon State University.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Generative AI promises to revolutionize every industry it touches ‚Äî all that‚Äôs been needed is the technology to meet the challenge.</p>
<p>NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang on Monday introduced that technology ‚Äî the company‚Äôs new Blackwell computing platform ‚Äî as he outlined the major advances that increased computing power can deliver for everything from software to services, robotics to medical technology and more.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAccelerated computing has reached the tipping point ‚Äî general purpose computing has run out of steam,‚Äù Huang told more than 11,000 GTC attendees gathered in-person ‚Äî and many tens of thousands more online ‚Äî for his keynote address at Silicon Valley‚Äôs cavernous SAP Center arena.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe need another way of doing computing ‚Äî so that we can continue to scale so that we can continue to drive down the cost of computing, so that we can continue to consume more and more computing while being sustainable. Accelerated computing is a dramatic speedup over general-purpose computing, in every single industry.‚Äù</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70552" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1365" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-400x267.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-672x448.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-675x450.jpg 675w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-323x215.jpg 323w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MC1_4926-1280x853.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>
<p>Huang spoke in front of massive images on a 40-foot tall, 8K screen the size of a tennis court to a crowd packed with CEOs and developers, AI enthusiasts and entrepreneurs, who walked together 20 minutes to the arena from the San Jose Convention Center on a dazzling spring day.</p>
<p>Delivering a massive upgrade to the world‚Äôs AI infrastructure, Huang introduced the NVIDIA Blackwell platform to unleash real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models.</p>
<p>Huang presented NVIDIA NIM ‚Äî a reference to NVIDIA inference microservices ‚Äî a new way of packaging and delivering software that connects developers with hundreds of millions of GPUs to deploy custom AI of all kinds.</p>
<p>And bringing AI into the physical world, Huang introduced Omniverse Cloud APIs to deliver advanced simulation capabilities.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y2F8yisiS6E?si=b9Y8b7x-sTGY4n-J" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Huang punctuated these major announcements with powerful demos, partnerships with some of the world‚Äôs largest enterprises and more than a score of announcements detailing his vision.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/">GTC</a> ‚Äî which in 15 years has grown from the confines of a local hotel ballroom to the world‚Äôs most important AI conference ‚Äî is returning to a physical event for the first time in five years.</p>
<p>This year‚Äôs has over 900 sessions ‚Äî including a panel discussion on transformers moderated by Huang with the eight pioneers who first developed the technology, more than 300 exhibits and 20-plus technical workshops.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs an event that‚Äôs at the intersection of AI and just about everything. In a stunning opening act to the keynote, Refik Anadol, the world&#8217;s leading AI artist, showed a massive real-time AI data sculpture with wave-like swirls in greens, blues, yellows and reds, crashing, twisting and unraveling across the screen.</p>
<p>As he kicked off his talk, Huang explained that the rise of multi-modal AI ‚Äî able to process diverse data types handled by different models ‚Äî gives AI greater adaptability and power. By increasing their parameters, these models can handle more complex analyses.</p>
<p>But this also means a significant rise in the need for computing power. And as these collaborative, multi-modal systems become more intricate ‚Äî with as many as a trillion parameters ‚Äî the demand for advanced computing infrastructure intensifies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe need even larger models,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to train it with multimodality data, not just text on the internet, we‚Äôre going to train it on texts and images, graphs and charts, and just as we learned watching TV, there‚Äôs going to be a whole bunch of watching video.‚Äù</p>
<h2>The Next Generation of Accelerated Computing</h2>
<p>In short, Huang said ‚Äúwe need bigger GPUs.‚Äù The Blackwell platform is built to meet this challenge. Huang pulled a Blackwell chip out of his pocket and held it up side-by-side with a Hopper chip, which it dwarfed.</p>
<p>Named for David Harold Blackwell ‚Äî a University of California, Berkeley mathematician specializing in game theory and statistics, and the first Black scholar inducted into the National Academy of Sciences ‚Äî the new architecture succeeds the NVIDIA Hopper architecture, launched two years ago.</p>
<p>Blackwell delivers 2.5x its predecessor‚Äôs performance in FP8 for training, per chip, and 5x with FP4 for inference. It features a fifth-generation NVLink interconnect that‚Äôs twice as fast as Hopper and scales up to 576 GPUs.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/">NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip</a> connects two Blackwell <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/b200/">NVIDIA B200 Tensor Core GPUs</a> to the NVIDIA Grace CPU over a 900GB/s ultra-low-power NVLink chip-to-chip interconnect.</p>
<p>Huang held up a board with the system. ‚ÄúThis computer is the first of its kind where this much computing fits into this small of a space,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúSince this is memory coherent, they feel like it‚Äôs one big happy family working on one application together.‚Äù</p>
<p>For the highest AI performance, GB200-powered systems can be connected with the NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand and Spectrum-X800 Ethernet platforms, also <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/networking-switches-gpu-computing-ai">announced today</a>, which deliver advanced networking at speeds up to 800Gb/s.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70577" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VIVY0652-1-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1365" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VIVY0652-1-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VIVY0652-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VIVY0652-1-672x448.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VIVY0652-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VIVY0652-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VIVY0652-1-675x450.jpg 675w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VIVY0652-1-323x215.jpg 323w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VIVY0652-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VIVY0652-1-1280x853.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe amount of energy we save, the amount of networking bandwidth we save, the amount of wasted time we save, will be tremendous,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúThe future is generative &#8230; which is why this is a brand new industry. The way we compute is fundamentally different. We created a processor for the generative AI era.‚Äù</p>
<p>To scale up Blackwell, NVIDIA built a new chip called NVLink Switch. Each can connect four NVLink interconnects at 1.8 terabytes per second and eliminate traffic by doing in-network reduction.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Switch and GB200 are key components of what Huang described as ‚Äúone giant GPU,‚Äù the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-gb200-nvl72-delivers-trillion-parameter-llm-training-and-real-time-inference/">NVIDIA GB200 NVL72</a>, a multi-node, liquid-cooled, rack-scale system that harnesses Blackwell to offer supercharged compute for trillion-parameter models, with 720 petaflops of AI training performance and 1.4 exaflops of AI inference performance in a single rack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere are only a couple, maybe three exaflop machines on the planet as we speak,‚Äù Huang said of the machine, which packs 600,000 parts and weighs 3,000 pounds. ‚ÄúAnd so this is an exaflop AI system in one single rack. Well let‚Äôs take a look at the back of it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Going even bigger, NVIDIA today also announced its next-generation AI supercomputer ‚Äî the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod-gb200/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD powered by NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips</a> ‚Äî for processing trillion-parameter models with constant uptime for superscale generative AI training and inference workloads.</p>
<p>Featuring a new, highly efficient, liquid-cooled rack-scale architecture, the new DGX SuperPOD is built with NVIDIA DG GB200 systems and provides 11.5 exaflops of AI supercomputing at FP4 precision and 240 terabytes of fast memory ‚Äî scaling to more with additional racks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the future, data centers are going to be thought of &#8230; as AI factories,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúTheir goal in life is to generate revenues, in this case, intelligence.‚Äù</p>
<p>The industry has already embraced Blackwell.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing">press release announcing Blackwell</a> includes endorsements from Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Dell CEO Michael Dell, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, and Tesla and xAI CEO Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Blackwell is being adopted by every major global cloud services provider,¬† pioneering AI companies, system and server vendors, and regional cloud service providers and telcos all around the world.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe whole industry is gearing up for Blackwell,‚Äù which Huang said would be the most successful launch in the company‚Äôs history.</p>
<h2>A New Way to Create Software</h2>
<p>Generative AI changes the way applications are written, Huang said.</p>
<p>Rather than writing software, he explained, companies will assemble AI models, give them missions, give examples of work products, review plans and intermediate results.</p>
<p>These packages ‚Äî NVIDIA NIMs ‚Äî are built from NVIDIA‚Äôs accelerated computing libraries and generative AI models, Huang explained.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow do we build software in the future? It is unlikely that you‚Äôll write it from scratch or write a whole bunch of Python code or anything like that,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúIt is very likely that you assemble a team of AIs.‚Äù</p>
<p>The microservices support industry-standard APIs so they are easy to connect, work across NVIDIA‚Äôs large CUDA installed base, are re-optimized for new GPUs, and are constantly scanned for security vulnerabilities and exposures.</p>
<p>Huang said customers can use NIM microservices off the shelf, or NVIDIA can help build proprietary AI and copilots, teaching a model specialized skills only a specific company would know to create invaluable new services.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe enterprise IT industry is sitting on a goldmine,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúThey have all these amazing tools (and data) that have been created over the years. If they could take that goldmine and turn it into copilots, these copilots can help us do things.‚Äù</p>
<p>Major tech players are already putting it to work. Huang detailed how NVIDIA is already helping Cohesity, NetApp, SAP, ServiceNow and Snowflake build copilots and virtual assistants. And industries are stepping in, as well.</p>
<p>In telecom, Huang announced the NVIDIA 6G Research Cloud, a generative AI and Omniverse-powered platform to advance the next communications era. It‚Äôs built with NVIDIA‚Äôs Sionna neural radio framework, NVIDIA Aerial CUDA-accelerated radio access network and the NVIDIA Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin for 6G.</p>
<p>In semiconductor design and manufacturing, Huang announced that, in collaboration with TSMC and Synopsys, NVIDIA is bringing its breakthrough computational lithography platform, cuLitho, to production. This platform will accelerate the most compute-intensive workload in semiconductor manufacturing by 40-60x.</p>
<p>Huang also announced the NVIDIA Earth Climate Digital Twin. The cloud platform ‚Äî available now ‚Äî enables interactive, high-resolution simulation to accelerate climate and weather prediction.</p>
<p>The greatest impact of AI will be in healthcare, Huang said, explaining that NVIDIA is already in imaging systems, in gene sequencing instruments and working with leading surgical robotics companies.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is launching a new type of biology software. NVIDIA today launched more than <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/generative-ai-microservices-for-developers">two dozen new microservices</a> that allow healthcare enterprises worldwide to take advantage of the latest advances in generative AI from anywhere and on any cloud. They offer advanced imaging, natural language and speech recognition, and digital biology generation, prediction and simulation.</p>
<h2>Omniverse Brings AI to the Physical World</h2>
<p>The next wave of AI will be AI learning about the physical world, Huang said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe need a simulation engine that represents the world digitally for the robot so that the robot has a gym to go learn how to be a robot,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe call that virtual world Omniverse.‚Äù</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why NVIDIA today announced that <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud</a> will be available as APIs, extending the reach of the world‚Äôs leading platform for creating industrial digital twin applications and workflows across the entire ecosystem of software makers.</p>
<p>The five new Omniverse Cloud application programming interfaces enable developers to easily integrate core Omniverse technologies directly into existing design and automation software applications for digital twins, or their simulation workflows for testing and validating autonomous machines like robots or self-driving vehicles.</p>
<p>To show how this works, Huang shared a demo of a robotic warehouse ‚Äî using multi-camera perception and tracking ‚Äî watching over workers and orchestrating robotic forklifts, which are driving autonomously with the full robotic stack running.</p>
<p>Huang also announced that NVIDIA is bringing Omniverse to Apple Vision Pro, with the new Omniverse Cloud APIs letting developers stream interactive industrial digital twins into the VR headsets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>With nearly two dozen world records to its name, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/cuopt/">NVIDIA cuOpt</a> now holds the top spot for 100% of the largest routing benchmarks in the last three years. And this means the route optimization engine allows industries to hop on board for all kinds of cost-saving efficiencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://global.kawasaki.com/">Kawasaki Heavy Industries</a> and SyncTwin are among the companies that are riding cuOpt for logistics improvements.</p>
<p>Today at GTC 2024, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced that cuOpt is moving into general availability.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith cuOpt, NVIDIA is reinventing logistics management and operations research. It is NVIDIA‚Äôs pre-quantum computer, driving transformational operational efficiencies for deliveries, service calls, warehouses and factories, and supply chains,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA cuOpt microservice, part of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform, makes accelerated optimization for real-time dynamic rerouting, factory optimization and robotic simulations available to any organization.</p>
<p>Companies can embed cuOpt into the advanced 3D tools, applications and USD-based workflows they develop with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a software platform for developing and deploying advanced 3D applications and pipelines based on OpenUSD.</p>
<p>Implemented together, cuOpt, Omniverse and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/metropolis-for-factories">NVIDIA Metropolis for Factories</a> can help optimize and create safe environments in logistics-heavy facilities that rely on complex automation, precise material flow and human-robot interaction, such as automotive factories, semiconductor fabs and warehouses.</p>
<p>cuOpt has been continuously tested against the best-known solutions on the most studied benchmarks for route optimization, with results up to 100x faster than CPU-based implementations. With 15 records from the Gehring &amp; Homberger vehicle routing benchmark and eight from the Li &amp; Lim pickup and delivery benchmark, cuOpt has demonstrated the world‚Äôs best accuracy with the fastest times.</p>
<p>AI promises to deliver logistics efficiencies spanning from transportation networks to manufacturing and much more.</p>
<h2><b>Delivering Cost-Savings for Inspections With cuOpt</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://global.kawasaki.com/">Kawasaki Heavy Industries</a> is a manufacturing company that&#8217;s been building large machinery for more than a hundred years. The Japanese company partnered with Slalom and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/case-studies/reinventing-maintenance-operations-with-ai/">used cuOpt to create routing efficiencies</a> for the development of its AI-driven <a href="https://global.kawasaki.com/">Kawasaki Track Maintenance Platform</a>.</p>
<p>Railroad track maintenance is getting an <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/autonomous-trains-deep-learning-dgx-drive/">AI makeover worldwide</a>. Traditionally, track inspections and maintenance are time-consuming and difficult to manage to keep trains running on time. But track maintenance is critical for safety and transportation service. Railway companies are automating track inspections with AI and machine learning paired with digital cameras, lasers and gyrometric sensors.</p>
<p><a href="https://global.kawasaki.com/">Kawasaki</a> is harnessing the edge computing of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin</a> to develop track inspections on its Track Maintenance Platform for running onboard trains. The platform enables customers to improve vision models with the data collected on tracks for advances in the inspection capability of the edge-based AI system.</p>
<p>The platform provides maintenance teams data on track conditions that allows them to prioritize repairs, creating increased safety and reliability of operations.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://global.kawasaki.com/">Kawasaki</a>, it‚Äôs estimated that such an AI-driven system can save $218 million a year for seven companies from automating their track inspections.</p>
<h2><b>Creating Manufacturing Efficiencies With cuOpt and Omniverse</b></h2>
<p>A worldwide leader in automotive seating manufacturing has adopted SyncTwin‚Äôs digital twin capability, which is driven by Omniverse and cuOpt, to improve its operations with AI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Cars of the future will be more than just modes of transportation; they‚Äôll be intelligent companions, seamlessly blending technology and comfort to enhance driving experiences, and built for safety, inside and out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/">NVIDIA GTC</a>, running this week at the San Jose Convention Center, will spotlight the groundbreaking work NVIDIA and its partners are doing to bring the transformative power of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20enables%20users%20to,or%20other%20types%20of%20data.">generative AI</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language models</a> and visual language models to the mobility sector.</p>
<p>At its booth, NVIDIA will showcase how it‚Äôs building automotive assistants to enhance driver safety, security and comfort through enhanced perception, understanding and generative capabilities powered by deep learning and transformer models.</p>
<h2><b>Talking the Talk</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/large-language-models/">LLMs</a>, a form of generative AI, largely represent a class of deep-learning architectures known as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-transformer-model/">transformer models</a>, which are neural networks adept at learning context and meaning.</p>
<p>Vision language models are another derivative of generative AI, that offer image processing and language understanding capabilities. Unlike traditional or multimodal LLMs that primarily process and generate text-based data, VLMs can analyze and generate text via images or videos.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generations</a> allows manufacturers to access knowledge from a specific database or the web to assist drivers.</p>
<p>These technologies together enable <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine</a>, or ACE, and multimodal language models to work together with the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/drive">NVIDIA DRIVE</a> platform to let automotive manufacturers develop their own intelligent in-car assistants.</p>
<p>For example, an Avatar configurator can allow designers to build unique, brand-inspired personas for their cars, complete with customized voices and emotional attributes. These AI-animated avatars can engage in natural dialogue, providing real-time assistance, recommendations and personalized interactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, AI-enhanced surround visualization enhances vehicle safety using 360-degree camera reconstruction, while the intelligent assistant sources external information, such as local driving laws, to inform decision-making.</p>
<p>Personalization is paramount, with AI assistants learning driver and passenger habits and adapting its behavior to suit occupants‚Äô needs.</p>
<h2><b>Generative AI for Automotive in Full Force at GTC¬†</b></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Designing, simulating and bringing up modern data centers is incredibly complex, involving multiple considerations like performance, energy efficiency and scalability.</p>
<p>It also requires bringing together a team of highly skilled engineers across compute and network design, computer-aided design (CAD) modeling, and mechanical, electrical and thermal design.</p>
<p>NVIDIA builds the world‚Äôs most advanced AI supercomputers and at GTC unveiled its latest ‚Äî a large cluster based on the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 liquid-cooled system. It consists of two racks, each containing 18 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-cpu/">NVIDIA Grace CPUs</a> and 36 <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing">NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs</a>, connected by fourth-generation <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/">NVIDIA NVLink</a> switches.</p>
<p>On the show floor, NVIDIA demoed this fully operational data center as a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-twin/">digital twin</a> in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform for connecting and building generative AI-enabled 3D pipelines, tools, applications and services.</p>
<p>To bring up new data centers as fast as possible, NVIDIA first built its digital twin with software tools connected by Omniverse. Engineers unified and visualized multiple CAD datasets in full physical accuracy and photorealism in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description</a> (OpenUSD) using the <a href="https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cadence</a> Reality digital twin platform, powered by NVIDIA Omniverse APIs.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Accelerating Data Center Design With Digital Twins" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h68kXLIRilM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Design, Simulate and Optimize With Enhanced Efficiency and Accuracy</b></h2>
<p>The new GB200 cluster is replacing an existing cluster in one of NVIDIA‚Äôs legacy data centers. To start the digital build-out, technology company <a href="https://kinetic-vision.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinetic Vision</a> scanned the facility using the <a href="https://www.navvis.com/vlx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NavVis VLX wearable lidar scanner</a> to produce highly accurate point cloud data and panorama photos.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="https://www.prevu3d.com/solutions/realitymesh-omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prevu3D</a> software was used to remove the existing clusters and convert the point cloud to a 3D mesh. This provided a physically accurate 3D model of the facility, in which the new digital data center could be simulated.</p>
<p>Engineers combined and visualized multiple CAD datasets with enhanced precision and realism by using the Cadence Reality platform. The platform‚Äôs integration with Omniverse provided a powerful computing platform that enabled teams to develop OpenUSD-based 3D tools, workflows and applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/omniverse-cloud-apis-industrial-digital-twin">Omniverse Cloud APIs</a> also added interoperability with more tools, including PATCH MANAGER and NVIDIA Air. With PATCH MANAGER, the team designed the physical layout of their cluster and networking infrastructure, ensuring that cabling lengths were accurate and routing was properly configured.</p>
<p>The team used Cadence‚Äôs Reality Digital Twin solvers, accelerated by <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus">NVIDIA Modulus</a> APIs and NVIDIA Grace Hopper, to simulate airflows, as well as the performance of the new liquid-cooling systems from partners like Vertiv and Schneider Electric. The integrated cooling systems in the GB200 trays were simulated and optimized using solutions from Ansys, which brought simulation data into the digital twin.</p>
<p>The demo showed how digital twins can allow users to fully test, optimize and validate data center designs before ever producing a physical system. By visualizing the performance of the data center in the digital twin, teams can better optimize their designs and plan for what-if scenarios.</p>
<p>Users can also enhance data center and cluster designs by balancing disparate sets of boundary conditions, such as cabling lengths, power, cooling and space, in an integrated manner ‚Äî enabling engineers and design teams to bring clusters online much faster and with more efficiency and optimization than before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>A sharp increase in generative AI deployments is driving business innovation for enterprises across industries. But it‚Äôs also posing significant challenges for their IT teams, as slowdowns from long and complex infrastructure deployment cycles prevent them from quickly spinning up AI workloads using their own data.</p>
<p>To help overcome these barriers, NVIDIA has introduced a storage partner validation program for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/platform/ovx/">NVIDIA OVX computing systems</a>. The high-performance storage systems leading the way in completing the NVIDIA OVX storage validation are <a href="https://www.ddn.com/blog/ddn-expands-support-for-nvidia-technology-to-enable-ai-application-acceleration-for-data-center-infrastructure/">DDN</a>, Dell PowerScale, <a href="https://www.netapp.com/blog/the-ai-revolution-netapp-aipod-with-nvidia-ovx/">NetApp</a>, <a href="https://www.purestorage.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/pure-and-nvidia-accelerate-enterprise-ai-adoption-to-meet-growing-demands.html">Pure Storage</a> and <a href="https://www.weka.io/blog/ai-ml/accelerating-ai-workloads-wekas-role-in-storage-partner-validation-for-nvidia-ovx-solutions/">WEKA</a>.</p>
<p>NVIDIA OVX servers combine high-performance, GPU-accelerated compute with high-speed storage access and low-latency networking to address a range of complex AI and graphics-intensive workloads. Chatbots, summarization and search tools, for example, require large amounts of data, and high-performance storage is critical to maximize system throughput.</p>
<p>To help enterprises pair the right storage with NVIDIA-Certified OVX servers, the new program provides a standardized process for partners to validate their storage appliances. They can use the same framework and testing that‚Äôs needed to validate storage for the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/data-center/dgx-basepod/">NVIDIA DGX BasePOD</a> reference architecture.</p>
<p>To achieve validation, partners must complete a suite of NVIDIA tests measuring storage performance and input/out scaling across multiple parameters that represent the demanding requirements of various enterprise AI workloads. This includes combinations of different I/O sizes, varying numbers of threads, buffered I/O vs. direct I/O, random reads, re-reads and more.</p>
<p>Each test is run multiple times to verify the results and gather the required data, which is then audited by NVIDIA engineering teams to determine whether the storage system has passed.</p>
<p>The program offers prescriptive guidance to ensure optimal storage performance and scalability for enterprise AI workloads with NVIDIA OVX systems. But the overall design remains flexible, so customers can tailor their system and storage choices to fit their existing data center environments and bring accelerated computing to wherever their data resides.</p>
<p>Generative AI use cases have fundamentally different requirements than traditional enterprise applications, so IT teams must carefully consider their compute, networking, storage and software choices to ensure high performance and scalability.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/certified-systems/">NVIDIA-Certified Systems</a> are tested and validated to provide enterprise-grade performance, manageability, security and scalability for AI workloads. Their flexible reference architectures help deliver faster, more efficient and more cost-effective deployments than independently building from the ground up.</p>
<p>Powered by<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/l40s/"> NVIDIA L40S GPUs</a>, OVX servers include<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/"> NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/">NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand</a> or<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/spectrumx/"> NVIDIA Spectrum-X</a> Ethernet networking, as well as<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/data-processing-unit/"> NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs</a>. They‚Äôre optimized for generative AI workloads, including training for smaller LLMs (for example, Llama 2 7B or 70B), fine-tuning existing models and inference with high throughput and low latency.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/certification-programs/nvidia-certified-systems/index.html#nvidia-certified-systems-ovx-list">NVIDIA-Certified OVX servers</a> are now available and shipping from global system vendors, including GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-unveils-hybrid-ai-solutions-delivering-power-of-generative-ai-to-enterprises-with-nvidia">Lenovo</a>. Comprehensive, enterprise-grade support for these servers is provided by each system builder, in collaboration with NVIDIA.</p>
<h2><b>Availability¬†</b></h2>
<p>Validated storage solutions for NVIDIA-Certified OVX servers are now available, and reference architectures will be published over the coming weeks by each of the storage and system vendors.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The latest advances in quantum computing include investigating molecules, deploying giant supercomputers and building the quantum workforce with a new academic program.</p>
<p>Researchers in Canada and the U.S. used a large language model to simplify quantum simulations that help scientists explore molecules.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis new quantum algorithm opens the avenue to a new way of combining quantum algorithms with machine learning,‚Äù said Alan Aspuru-Guzik, a professor of chemistry and computer science at the University of Toronto, who led the team.</p>
<p>The effort used <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-q">CUDA-Q</a>, a hybrid programming model for GPUs, CPUs and the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-qpu/">QPUs</a> quantum systems use. The team ran its research on <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/eos/">Eos</a>, NVIDIA‚Äôs H100 GPU supercomputer.</p>
<p>Software from the effort will be made available for researchers in fields like healthcare and chemistry. Aspuru-Guzik will detail the work in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/session-catalog/?search=quantum&amp;tab.allsessions=1700692987788001F1cG&amp;search=quantum#/session/1696280074506001Ts8y">a talk</a> at GTC.</p>
<h2><b>Quantum Scales for Fraud Detection</b></h2>
<p>At HSBC, one of the world‚Äôs largest banks, researchers designed a quantum machine learning application that can detect fraud in digital payments.</p>
<p>The bank‚Äôs quantum machine learning algorithm simulated a whopping 165 qubits on NVIDIA GPUs. Research papers typically don‚Äôt extend beyond 40 of these fundamental calculating units quantum systems use.</p>
<p>HSBC used machine learning techniques implemented with CUDA-Q and<a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/latest/cutensornet/index.html"> cuTensorNet</a> software on NVIDIA GPUs to overcome challenges simulating quantum circuits at scale. Mekena Metcalf, a quantum computing research scientist at HSBC (pictured above), will present her work in a<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/session-catalog/?tab.allsessions=1700692987788001F1cG&amp;search=quantum#/session/1693079968998001x10J"> session at GTC</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The journey to the future of secure communications is about to jump to warp drive.</p>
<p>NVIDIA cuPQC brings accelerated computing to developers working on cryptography for the age of quantum computing. The cuPQC library harnesses the parallelism of GPUs for their most demanding security algorithms.</p>
<h2><b>Refactoring Security for the Quantum Era¬†¬†</b></h2>
<p>Researchers have known for years that quantum computers will be able to break the public keys used today to secure communications. As these systems approach readiness, government and industry initiatives have been ramping up to address this vital issue.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, for example, is expected to introduce the first standard algorithms for post-quantum cryptography as early as this year.</p>
<p>Cryptographers working on advanced algorithms to replace today‚Äôs public keys need powerful systems to design and test their work.</p>
<h2><b>Hopper Delivers up to 500x Speedups With cuPQC</b></h2>
<p>In its first benchmarks, cuPQC accelerated Kyber ‚Äî an algorithm proposed as a standard for securing quantum-resistant keys ‚Äî by up to 500x running on an <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-tensor-core">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU</a> compared with a CPU.</p>
<p>The speedups will be even greater with <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing">NVIDIA Blackwell architecture GPUs</a>, given Blackwell‚Äôs enhancements for the integer math used in cryptography and other high performance computing workloads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Securing data against quantum threats is a critically important problem, and we&#8217;re excited to work with NVIDIA to optimize post-quantum cryptography,&#8221; said Douglas Stebila, co-founder of the Open Quantum Safe project, a group spearheading work in the emerging field.</p>
<h2><b>Accelerating Community Efforts</b></h2>
<p>The project is a part of the newly formed Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance, hosted by the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p>The alliance funds open source projects to develop post-quantum libraries and applications. NVIDIA is a member of the alliance with seats on both its steering and technical committees.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is also collaborating with cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure on testing cuPQC.</p>
<p>In addition, leading companies in post-quantum cryptography such as evolutionQ, PQShield, QuSecure and SandboxAQ are collaborating with NVIDIA, many with plans to integrate cuPQC into their offerings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Different use cases will require a range of approaches for optimal acceleration,‚Äù said Ben Packman, a senior vice president at PQShield. &#8220;We are delighted to explore cuPQC with NVIDIA.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>AI ‚Äî already used to connect, analyze and offer predictions based on operating room data ‚Äî will be critical to the future of surgery, boosting operating room efficiency and clinical decision-making.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why NVIDIA is working with <a href="https://www.jnjmedtech.com/en-US/news-events/johnson-johnson-medtech-working-nvidia-scale-ai-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson &amp; Johnson MedTech</a> to test new AI capabilities for the company‚Äôs connected digital ecosystem for surgery. It aims to enable open innovation and accelerate the delivery of real-time insights at scale to support medical professionals before, during and after procedures.</p>
<p>J&amp;J MedTech is in 80% of the world‚Äôs operating rooms and <a href="https://jnjinstitute.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trains more than 140,000 healthcare professionals</a> each year through its education programs.</p>
<p>Seeking to bring together its legacy and digital ecosystem in surgery with NVIDIA‚Äôs leading AI solutions ‚Äî including the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/edge-computing/products/igx/">NVIDIA IGX</a> edge computing platform and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/holoscan/">NVIDIA Holoscan</a> edge AI platform for building medical devices ‚Äî J&amp;J MedTech can accelerate the infrastructure needed to deploy AI-powered software applications for surgery. IGX and Holoscan can support secure, real-time processing from devices across the operating room to provide clinical insights and improve surgical outcomes.</p>
<p>Unveiled at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/">NVIDIA GTC</a>, the global AI conference taking place March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online, this work could also facilitate the deployment of third-party models and applications developed across the digital surgery ecosystem by providing a common AI compute platform.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAI models are currently being created by experts in surgery in various parts of the world,‚Äù said Shan Jegatheeswaran, vice president and global head of digital at J&amp;J MedTech. ‚ÄúIf we can create a trusted, open ecosystem that enables and accelerates coordination, it would create a flywheel of innovation where different groups can collaborate and connect at scale, improving access to advanced analytics across the surgical experience.‚Äù</p>
<h2><b>An Open Ecosystem for AI Innovation: Building on NVIDIA Holoscan and IGX¬†</b></h2>
<p>J&amp;J MedTech is working with NVIDIA to test how industrial-grade edge AI capabilities purpose-built for medical environments could benefit surgery.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur connected digital ecosystem will help break down the traditional barriers to entry for developers seeking to build applications and deploy analytics in the operating room,‚Äù Jegatheeswaran said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre making it simpler for those who want to participate in the surgical workflow by eliminating the heavy lifting of building a secure, enterprise-grade platform.‚Äù</p>
<p>NVIDIA Holoscan accelerates the development and deployment of real-time AI applications to process data streams.</p>
<p>Holoscan includes reference pipelines to build AI applications for a variety of medical use cases, including endoscopy, ultrasound and other sensors. It runs on NVIDIA IGX, which includes <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson Orin</a> modules, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a6000/">NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/ethernet-adapters/">NVIDIA ConnectX</a> networking technology to enable high-speed data streaming from medical devices or operating room video feeds.</p>
<p>NVIDIA supports the IGX software stack with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a>, the enterprise operating system for production-grade AI.</p>
<h2><b>Fueling Surgical AI With Device Data</b></h2>
<p>The J&amp;J MedTech team envisions the potential of NVIDIA-accelerated edge analytics behind its connected digital ecosystem as an enabler of AI-powered applications fueled by device, patient and other surgical data.</p>
<p>Developers could leverage continuous learning, where an algorithm improves based on data collected by the deployed device. Real-world footage collected by an endoscope, for example, could be used to refine an AI model that identifies organs, tissue and potential tumors in real time on an operating room display to support clinical decision-making.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSurgical technologies will get more intelligent over time, bringing the power of advanced analytics to surgeons and hospitals,‚Äù said Jegatheeswaran. ‚ÄúA collection of AI models could act like driver-assistance technology for surgeons, amplifying their ability to deliver care while reducing cognitive load.‚Äù</p>
<p>One example is AI that removes personally identifiable information from surgical videos so they can be used downstream for research purposes ‚Äî or, when processed in real time, enable hospitals to bring in external experts through telepresence to consult during a surgery while maintaining patient privacy.</p>
<p>Future applications could enable surgeons to interact with chatbots to gain insights about a patient‚Äôs medical history or best practices for handling certain complications. Other models could improve operating room efficiency by using video feeds to understand when a procedure is almost complete, alerting the next surgical team that a room will soon be available.</p>
