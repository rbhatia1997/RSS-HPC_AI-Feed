										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Ninety-eight percent of retailers plan to invest in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> in the next 18 months, according to a <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/en-us/lp/industries/state-of-ai-in-retail-and-cpg/">new survey</a> conducted by NVIDIA.</p>
<p>That makes retail one of the industries racing fastest to adopt generative AI to ramp up productivity, transform customer experiences and improve efficiency.</p>
<p>Early deployments in the retail industry include personalized shopping advisors and adaptive advertising, with retailers initially testing off-the-shelf models like GPT-4 from OpenAI.</p>
<p>But many are now realizing the value in developing custom models trained on their proprietary data to achieve brand-appropriate tone and personalized results in a scalable, cost-effective way.</p>
<p>Before building them, companies must first consider a variety of questions: whether to opt for an open-source, closed-source or enterprise model; how they plan to train and deploy the models; how to host them; and, most importantly, how to ensure future innovations and new products can be easily incorporated into them.</p>
<p>New offerings like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/">NVIDIA AI Foundations</a>, a curated collection of optimized, enterprise-grade foundation models from NVIDIA and leading open-source pretrained models, are giving retail companies the building blocks they need to construct their custom models. With <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, an end-to-end platform for large language model development, retailers can customize and deploy their models at scale using the latest state-of-the-art techniques.</p>
<h2><b>Generative AI Use Cases </b></h2>
<p>Multimodal models are leading the new frontier in the generative AI landscape. They’re capable of processing, understanding and generating content and images from multiple sources such as text, image, video and 3D rendered assets.</p>
<p>This allows retailers to create eye-catching images or videos for a brand’s marketing and advertising campaign using only a few lines of text prompts. Or they can be used to deliver  personalized shopping experiences with in-situ and try-on product image results. Yet another use case is in product description generation, where generative AI can intelligently generate detailed e-commerce product descriptions that include product attributes, using meta-tags to greatly improve SEO.</p>
<p>Many retailers are testing the generative AI waters first with internal deployments. For example, some are boosting the productivity of their engineering teams with AI-powered computer code generators that can write optimized lines of code for indicated outcomes. Others are using custom models to generate marketing copy and promotions for various audience segments, increasing click-to-conversion rates. Meanwhile, chatbots and translators are helping employees accomplish their day-to-day tasks.</p>
<p>To enhance customer experiences, retailers are deploying generative AI-powered shopping advisors that can offer personalized product recommendations ​in customer-tailored conversation styles and display images of products being recommended. It can even display those products if shoppers want to see the recommended product, for example, in their home by uploading a picture of a room. Another use case is a customer service multilingual chatbot capable of answering simple customer inquiries and routing complex ones to human agents for improved, more efficient service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA and the Loss Prevention Research Council (LPRC) are collaborating with several AI companies to showcase a real-time solution for combating and preventing organized retail crime (ORC).</p>
<p>The integrated offering provides advance notifications of suspicious behavior inside and outside stores so that authorities can intervene early.</p>
<p>The LPRC includes asset-protection executives from more than 85 major retail chains, with hundreds of thousands of stores worldwide, as well as law enforcement, consumer packaged goods companies and technology solutions partners. It’s focused on collaborating with the retail industry to reduce shrink — the loss of products for reasons other than sales — and increase safety and security at stores and shopping malls.</p>
<p>Flash mobs and smash-and-grab thefts are a growing concern, costing retailers billions of dollars in lost revenue and causing safety concerns among customers and employees. Crime syndicates have committed brazen, large-scale thefts, often selling stolen merchandise on the black market.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/shrink-accounted-over-112-billion-industry-losses-2022-according-nrf#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20survey%2C%20the,65%25)%20of%20retailers'%20shrink.">National Retail Federation survey</a> found that shrink accounted for $112 billion in losses in 2022, with an estimated two-thirds due to theft.</p>
<p>Increasingly, this involves violence. According to the survey, 67% of respondents said they were seeing more violence and aggression associated with organized-crime theft than a year ago.</p>
<p>The AI-based solution, which helps retailers get a jump on often-evasive, fast-moving organized crime groups, uses technology from several leading AI firms that have built their high-performance AI applications on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/intelligent-video-analytics-platform/">NVIDIA Metropolis</a> application framework and microservices.</p>
<p>The solution includes product recognition and tracking, as well as anomaly detection, from AiFi, vehicle license plate and model recognition from BriefCam, and physical security management from SureView to provide advance and real-time notifications to retailer command centers.</p>
<p>The three are among over 500 software companies and startups that have developed retail, safety and security AI applications on NVIDIA Metropolis software development kits for vision AI — and that have been certified as NVIDIA Metropolis partners.</p>
<p>“The proposed AI-based ORC solution combines LPRC’s deep expertise in loss prevention from over 23 years of collaboration with asset protection executives with NVIDIA’s deep AI expertise,” said Read Hayes, who leads the LPRC and is a University of Florida research scientist and criminologist. “We believe this type of cross-industry collaboration will help retailers fight back against organized retail crime.”</p>
<h2><b>Developing Integrated AI for Securing Stores </b></h2>
<p>AiFi, based in Silicon Valley, develops <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-computer-vision/">computer vision</a> solutions, including autonomous retail capabilities built on the NVIDIA Metropolis application framework. Its solution detects anomalies in shopper behavior, tracks items removed from shelves and notifies retailers if shoppers bypass checkout lanes.</p>
<p><a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhubs.la%2FQ02fdxX00&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cobass%40nvidia.com%7C30a2729430154667d04708dc0d5a5c87%7C43083d15727340c1b7db39efd9ccc17a%7C0%7C0%7C638399929011629141%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=%2BN3Eb5BRJnJVl%2Fv3Eqyrkrb7yUGwzxywkGA3XGfh7%2Fw%3D&amp;reserved=0">BriefCam</a>, based in Newton, Mass., provides deep learning-based video analytics technology for insightful decision-making. Enabling the forensic search, alerting on and visualization of objects in video, the BriefCam Platform includes integrated license plate recognition and cross-camera object tracking, alongside other capabilities that support effective asset protection and real-time response to theft attempts.</p>
<p><a href="https://sureviewsystems.com/">SureView</a>, based in Tampa, Fla., offers a software platform for managing multiple security systems with a single view. The company’s physical security management system receives signals from the AiFi and BriefCam applications, helping teams coordinate a quick and consistent response and providing notifications to store security operations and law enforcement based on the retailer’s business rules.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Generative AI is transforming drug research and development, enabling new discoveries faster than ever — and Amgen, one of the world’s leading biotechnology companies, is tapping the technology to power its research.</p>
<p>Amgen will build AI models trained to analyze one of the world’s largest human datasets on an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD</a>, a full-stack data center platform, that will be installed at Amgen’s deCODE genetics’ headquarters in Reykjavik, Iceland. The system will be named Freyja in honor of the powerful, life-giving Norse goddess associated with the ability to predict the future.</p>
<p>Freyja will be used to build a human diversity atlas for drug target and disease-specific biomarker discovery, providing vital diagnostics for monitoring disease progression and regression. The system will also help develop AI-driven precision medicine models, potentially enabling individualized therapies for patients with serious diseases.</p>
<p>Amgen plans to integrate the DGX SuperPOD, which will feature 31 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-h100/">NVIDIA DGX H100</a> nodes totaling 248 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, to train state-of-the-art AI models in days rather than months, enabling researchers to more efficiently analyze and learn from data in their search for novel health and therapeutics insights.</p>
<p>“For more than a decade, Amgen has been preparing for this hinge moment we are seeing in the industry, powered by the union of technology and biotechnology,” said David M. Reese, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Amgen. “We look forward to  combining the breadth and maturity of our world-class human data capabilities at Amgen with NVIDIA’s technologies.”</p>
<p>The goal of deCODE founder and CEO Kári Stefánsson in starting the company was to understand human disease by looking at the diversity of the human genome. He predicted in a recent <a href="https://tslabtalk.podbean.com/e/the-human-data-era-the-role-of-human-diversity-in-progressing-precision-medicine/">Amgen podcast</a> that within the next 10 years, doctors will routinely use genetics to explore uncommon diseases in patients.</p>
<p>“This SuperPOD has the potential to accelerate our research by training models more quickly and helping us generate questions we might not have otherwise thought to ask,” said Stefánsson.</p>
<h2><strong>Putting the Tech in Biotechnology</strong></h2>
<p>Since its founding in 1996, deCODE has curated more than 200 petabytes of de-identified human data from nearly 3 million individuals.</p>
<p>The company started by collecting de-identified data from Icelanders, who have a rich heritage in genealogies that stretch back for centuries. This population-scale data from research volunteers provides unique insights into human diversity as it applies to disease.</p>
<p>deCODE has also helped sequence more than half a million human genomes from volunteers in the <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/learn-more-about-uk-biobank/news/world-s-largest-genetic-project-opens-the-door-to-new-era-for-treatments-and-cures-uk-biobank-s-major-milestone">UK Biobank</a>.</p>
<p>But drawing insights from this much data requires powerful AI systems.</p>
<p>By integrating powerful new technology, Amgen has an opportunity to accelerate the discovery and development of life-changing medicines. In March 2023, NVIDIA announced that Amgen became one of the first companies <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-unveils-large-language-models-and-generative-ai-services-to-advance-life-sciences-r-d">to employ NVIDIA BioNeMo</a>, which researchers have used to build generative AI models to accelerate drug discovery and development. Amgen researchers have also been accessing BioNeMo via <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a>, an AI supercomputing service.</p>
<p>“Models trained in BioNeMo can advance drug discovery on multiple fronts,” said Marti Head, executive director of computational and data sciences at Amgen. “In addition to helping develop drugs that are more effective, they can also help avoid unwanted effects like immune responses, and new biologics can be made in volume.”</p>
<p>By adopting DGX SuperPOD, Amgen is poised to gain unprecedented data insights with the potential to change the pace and scope of drug discovery.</p>
<p>“The fusion of advanced AI, groundbreaking developments in biology and molecular engineering and vast quantities of human data are not just reshaping how we discover and develop new medicines — they’re redefining medicine,” Reese said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>In perhaps the healthcare industry’s most dramatic transformation since the advent of computing, digital biology and generative AI are helping to reinvent drug discovery, surgery, medical imaging and wearable devices.</p>
<p>NVIDIA has been preparing for this moment for over a decade, building deep domain expertise, creating the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/">NVIDIA Clara</a> healthcare-specific computing platform and expanding its work with a rich ecosystem of partners. Healthcare customers and partners already consume well over a billion dollars in NVIDIA GPU computing each year — directly and indirectly through cloud partners.</p>
<p>In the $250 billion field of drug discovery, these efforts are meeting an inflection point: R&amp;D teams can now represent drugs inside a computer.</p>
<p>By harnessing emerging generative AI tools, drug discovery teams observe foundational building blocks of molecular sequence, structure, function and meaning — allowing them to generate or design novel molecules likely to possess desired properties. With these capabilities, researchers can curate a more precise field of drug candidates to investigate, reducing the need for expensive, time-consuming physical experiments.</p>
<p>Accelerating this shift is <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/gpu-cloud/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a>, a generative AI platform that provides services to develop, customize and deploy foundation models for drug discovery.</p>
<p>Used by pharmaceutical, techbio and software companies, BioNeMo offers a new class of computational methods for drug research and development, enabling scientists to integrate generative AI to reduce experiments and, in some cases, replace them altogether.</p>
<p>In addition to developing, optimizing and hosting AI models through BioNeMo, NVIDIA has boosted the computer-aided drug discovery ecosystem with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-investments/">investments in innovative techbio companies</a> — such as biopharmaceutical company Recursion, which is offering one of its foundation models for BioNeMo users, and biotech company Terray Therapeutics, which is using BioNeMo for AI model development.</p>
<h2><b>BioNeMo Brings Precision to AI-Accelerated Drug Discovery </b></h2>
<p>BioNeMo features a growing collection of pretrained biomolecular AI models for protein structure prediction, protein sequence generation, molecular optimization, generative chemistry, docking prediction and more. It also enables computer-aided drug discovery companies to make their models available to a broad audience through easy-to-access APIs for inference and customization.</p>
<p>Drug discovery teams use BioNeMo to invent or customize generative AI models with proprietary data — and drug discovery software companies, techbios and large pharmas  are integrating  BioNeMo cloud APIs, which will be released in beta this month, into platforms that deliver computer-aided drug discovery workflows.</p>
<p>The cloud APIs will now include <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/">foundation models</a> from three sources: models invented by NVIDIA, such as the MolMIM generative chemistry model for small molecule generation; open-source models pioneered by global research teams, curated and optimized by NVIDIA, such as the OpenFold protein prediction AI; and proprietary models developed by NVIDIA partners, such as Recursion’s Phenom-Beta for embedding cellular microscopy images.</p>
<p>MolMIM generates small molecules while giving users finer control over the AI generation process — identifying new molecules that possess desired properties and follow constraints specified by users. For example, researchers could direct the model to generate molecules that have similar structures and properties to a given reference molecule.</p>
<h2><b>Phenomenal AI for Pharma:</b><b> Recursion </b><b>Brings Phenom-Beta Model to BioNeMo</b></h2>
<p>Recursion is the first hosting partner offering an AI model through BioNeMo cloud APIs: Phenom-Beta, a vision <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-transformer-model/">transformer model</a> that extracts biologically meaningful features from cellular microscopy images.</p>
<p>This capability can provide researchers with insights about cell function and help them learn how cells respond to drug candidates or genetic engineering.</p>

Read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16064" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeurIPS workshop paper</a> to learn more.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Phenom-Beta was trained on Recursion’s publicly available <a href="https://www.rxrx.ai/rxrx3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RxRx3 dataset</a> of biological images using the company’s BioHive-1 supercomputer, based on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD</a> reference architecture.</p>
<p>To further its foundation model development, Recursion is <a href="https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-provides-business-updates-and-reports-third-quarter-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding its supercomputer </a>with more than 500 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>. This will boost its computational capacity by 4x to create what’s expected to be the most powerful supercomputer owned and operated by any biopharma company.</p>

<h2><b>How Companies Are Adopting NVIDIA BioNeMo</b></h2>
<p>A growing group of scientists, biotech and pharma companies, and AI software vendors are using NVIDIA BioNeMo to support biology, chemistry and genomics research.</p>
<p>Biotech leader <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-cloud/terray-therapeutics-customer-success-story">Terray Therapeutics</a> is integrating BioNeMo cloud APIs into its development of a generalized, multi-target structural binding model. The company also uses <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a> to train chemistry foundation models to power generative AI for small molecule design.</p>
<p>Protein engineering and molecular design companies Innophore and Insilico Medicine are bringing BioNeMo into their computational drug discovery applications. Innophore is integrating BioNeMo cloud APIs into its Catalophore platform for protein design and drug discovery. And Insilico, a premier member of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a> program for startups, has adopted BioNeMo in its generative AI pipeline for early drug discovery.</p>
<p>Biotech software company OneAngstrom and systems integrator Deloitte are using BioNeMo cloud APIs to build AI solutions for their clients.</p>
<p>OneAngstrom is integrating BioNeMo cloud APIs into its SAMSON platform for molecular design used by academics, biotechs and pharmas. Deloitte is transforming scientific research by integrating BioNeMo on NVIDIA DGX Cloud with the Quartz Atlas AI platform. This combination enables biopharma researchers with unparalleled data connectivity and cutting-edge generative AI, propelling them into a new era of accelerated drug discovery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The AI revolution returned to where it started this week, putting powerful new tools into the hands of gamers and content creators.</p>
<p>Generative AI models that will bring lifelike characters to games and applications and new GPUs for gamers and creators were among the highlights of a news-packed address Monday ahead of this week’s CES trade show in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“Today, NVIDIA is at the center of the latest technology transformation: generative AI,” said Jeff Fisher, senior vice president for GeForce at NVIDIA, who was joined by leaders across the company to introduce products and partnerships across gaming, content creation, and robotics.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-JbSg2UnK2k?si=bTsTe6wc22SGGtdw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>A Launching Pad for Generative AI</strong></h2>
<p>As AI shifts into the mainstream, Fisher said NVIDIA’s RTX GPUs, with more than 100 million units shipped, are pivotal in the burgeoning field of generative AI, exemplified by innovations like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion.</p>
<p>In October, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-inference-on-llms-with-tensorrt-llm-now-publicly-available/#:~:text=Today%2C%20NVIDIA%20announces%20the%20public,of%20the%20NVIDIA%20NeMo%20framework.">NVIDIA released the TensorRT-LLM library for Windows</a>, accelerating large language models, or LLMs, like Llama 2 and Mistral up to 5x on RTX PCs.</p>
<p>And with our new <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/chat-with-rtx">Chat with RTX</a> playground, releasing later this month, enthusiasts can connect an RTX-accelerated LLM to their own data, from locally stored documents to YouTube videos, using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, or RAG, a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models.</p>
<p>Fisher also introduced TensorRT acceleration for Stable Diffusion XL and SDXL Turbo in the popular Automatic1111 text-to-image app, providing up to a 60% boost in performance.</p>
<h2><strong>NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine Microservices Debut With Generative AI Models for Digital Avatars</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a> is a technology platform that brings digital avatars to life with generative AI. ACE AI models are designed to run in the cloud or locally on the PC.</p>
<p>In an ACE demo featuring <a href="https://www.convai.com/">Convai’s </a>new technologies, NVIDIA’s Senior Product Manager Seth Schneider showed how it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA ACE Brings Digital Characters to Life with Generative AI ft. Convai" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psrXGPh80UM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>First, a player’s voice input is passed to NVIDIA’s automatic speech recognition model, which translates speech to text. Then, the text is put into an LLM to generate the character’s response.</p>
<p>After that, the text response is vocalized using a text-to-speech model, which is passed to an animation model to create a realistic lip sync. Finally, the dynamic character is rendered into the game scene.</p>
<p>At CES, NVIDIA is announcing ACE Production Microservices for NVIDIA Audio2Face and NVIDIA Riva Automatic Speech Recognition. Available now, each model can be incorporated by developers individually into their pipelines.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is also announcing game and interactive avatar developers are pioneering ways ACE and generative AI technologies can be used to transform interactions between players and non-playable characters in games and applications. Developers embracing ACE include <a href="https://www.convai.com/">Convai</a>, <a href="https://charisma.ai/">Charisma.AI</a>, <a href="https://inworld.ai/">Inworld</a>, <a href="https://www.mihoyo.com/en/">miHoYo</a>, <a href="https://www.neteasegames.com/">NetEase Games</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSg-4HmLvfI">Ourpalm</a>, <a href="https://www.tencent.com/">Tencent</a>, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/">Ubisoft</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalhumans.com/">UneeQ</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Getty Images Releases Generative AI by iStock and AI Image Generation Tools Powered by NVIDIA Picasso</strong></h2>
<p>Generative AI empowers designers and marketers to create concept imagery, social media content and more. Today, iStock by Getty Images is releasing a genAI service built on NVIDIA Picasso, an AI foundry for visual design, Fisher announced.</p>
<p>The iStock service allows anyone to create 4K imagery from text using an AI model trained on Getty Images’ extensive catalog of licensed, commercially safe creative content. New editing application programming interfaces that give customers powerful control over their generated images are also coming soon.</p>
<p>The generative AI service is available today at istock.com, with advanced editing features releasing via API.</p>
<h2><strong>NVIDIA Introduces GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series</strong></h2>
<p>Fisher announced a new series of <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/geforce-rtx-40-super-series">GeForce RTX 40 SUPER GPUs</a> with more gaming and generative AI performance.</p>
<p>Fisher said that the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER can power fully ray-traced games at 4K. It’s 1.4x faster than the RTX 3080 Ti without frame gen in the most graphically intensive games. With 836 AI TOPS, NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation delivers an extra performance boost, making the RTX 4080 SUPER twice as fast as an RTX 3080 Ti.</p>
<p>Creators can generate video with Stable Video Diffusion 1.5x faster and images with Stable Diffusion XL 1.7x faster. The RTX 4080 SUPER features more cores and faster memory, giving it a performance edge at a great new price of $999. It will be available starting Jan. 31.</p>
<p>Next up is the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER. NVIDIA has added more cores and increased the frame buffer to 16GB and the memory bus to 256 bits. It’s 1.6x faster than a 3070 Ti and 2.5x faster with DLSS 3, Fisher said. The RTX 4070 Ti SUPER will be available starting Jan. 24 for $799.</p>
<p>Fisher also introduced the RTX 4070 SUPER. NVIDIA has added 20% more cores, making it faster than the RTX 3090 while using a fraction of the power. And with DLSS 3, it’s 1.5x faster in the most demanding games. It will be available for $599 starting Jan. 17.</p>
<h2><strong>NVIDIA RTX Remix Open Beta Launches This Month</strong></h2>
<p>There are over 10 billion game mods downloaded each year. With <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx-remix/">RTX Remix</a>, modders can remaster classic games with full ray tracing, DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex and generative AI texture tools that transform low-resolution textures into 4K, physically accurate materials. The RTX Remix app will be released in open beta on Jan. 22.</p>
<p>RTX Remix has already delivered stunning remasters in NVIDIA’s <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/portal-with-rtx-full-ray-tracing-december-8/"><i>Portal with RTX</i></a> and the modder-made <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/portal-prelude-rtx-available-now-for-free/"><i>Portal: Prelude RTX</i></a>. Now, Orbifold Studios is using RTX Remix to develop <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/half-life-2-rtx-remix-in-development/"><i>Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project</i></a>, a community remaster of one of the highest-rated games of all time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Twitch and NVIDIA to Release Multi-Encode Livestreaming</strong></h2>
<p>Twitch is one of the most popular platforms for content creators, with over 7 million streamers going live each month to 35 million daily viewers. Fisher explained that these viewers are on all kinds of devices and internet services.</p>
<p>Yet many Twitch streamers are limited to broadcasting at a single resolution and quality level. As a result, they must broadcast at lower quality to reach more viewers.</p>
<p>To address this, Twitch, OBS and NVIDIA announced Enhanced Broadcasting, supported by all RTX GPUs. This new feature allows streamers to transmit up to three concurrent streams to Twitch at different resolutions and quality so each viewer gets the optimal experience.</p>
<p>Beta signups start today and will go live later this month. Twitch will also experiment with 4K and AV1 on the GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs to deliver even better quality and higher resolution streaming.</p>
<h2><strong>‘New Wave’ of AI-Ready RTX Laptops</strong></h2>
<p>RTX is the fastest-growing laptop platform, having grown 5x in the last four years. Over 50 million devices are enjoyed by gamers and creators across the globe.</p>
<p>More’s coming. Fisher announced “a new wave” of RTX laptops launching from every major manufacturer. “Thanks to powerful RT and Tensor Cores, every RTX laptop is AI-ready for the best gaming and AI experiences,” Fisher said.</p>
<p>With an installed base of 100 million GPUs and 500 RTX games and apps, GeForce RTX is the world’s largest platform for gamers, creators and, now, generative AI.</p>
<h2><strong>Activision and Blizzard Games Embrace RTX</strong></h2>
<p>More than 500 games and apps now take advantage of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX technology</a>, NVIDIA’s Senior Consumer Marketing Manager Kristina Bartz said, including <i>Alan Wake 2</i>, which won three awards at this year’s Game Awards.</p>

<h2><b>AI and RTX Bring Illustrations to Life</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA artists and this week’s <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i> features Ashlee Martino-Tarr and Daniela Flamm Jackson are passionate about illustration — whether in work or at play.</p>
<p>They used Adobe Firefly’s generative AI features, powered by NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud and accelerated with Tensor Cores in GeForce RTX GPUs, to animate a 2D illustration with special effects.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Bring Illustrations to Life with Adobe AI Effects power by NVIDIA GPUs on PC &amp; in the Cloud" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ELrpfVY4P4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>To begin, the pair separated the 2D image into multiple layers and expanded the canvas. Firefly’s <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/ai.html">Generative Expand</a> feature automatically filled the added space with AI-generated content.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-69135-1" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-1.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-1.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-1.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, the team separated select elements — starting with character — and used the AI Object Select feature to automatically mask the layer. The Generative Fill feature then created new content to fill in the background, saving even more time.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-69135-2" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-2-1.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-2-1.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-2-1.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process continued until all distinct layers were separated and imported into Adobe After Effects. Next, they used the Mercury 3D Engine on local RTX GPUs to accelerate playback, unlocking smoother movement in the viewport. Previews and adjustments like camera shake and depth of field were also GPU-accelerated.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-69135-3" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-3.mp4?_=3" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-3.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-3.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firefly’s Style Match feature then took the existing illustration and created new imagery in its likeness — in this case, a vibrant butterfly sporting similar colors and tones. The duo also used Adobe Illustrator’s <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/generative-recolor.html">Generative Recolor</a> feature, which enables artists to explore a wide variety of colors and themes without having to manually recolor their work.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-69135-4" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-4.mp4?_=4" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-4.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-4.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Martino-Tarr and Jackson then chose their preferred assets and animated them in Adobe After Effects. Firefly’s powerful AI effects helped speed or entirely eliminate tedious tasks such as patching holes, handpainting set extensions and caching animation playbacks.</p>

<p>The artists concluded post-production work by putting the finishing touches on their AI animation in After Effects.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-69135-5" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-5.mp4?_=5" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-5.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-studio-itns-wk91-firefly-demo-1280w-clip-5.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firefly’s powerful AI capabilities were developed with the creative community in mind — guided by AI ethics principles of content and data transparency — to ensure morally responsible output. NVIDIA technology continues to power these features from the cloud for photographers, illustrators, designers, video editors, 3D artists and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Twitch, OBS and NVIDIA are leveling up livestreaming technology with the new Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting beta, powered by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">GeForce RTX GPUs</a>. Available in a few days, streamers will be able to stream multiple encodes concurrently, providing optimal viewing experiences for all viewers.<i> </i></p>
<h2><b>Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting</b></h2>
<p>Today, many streamers must choose between higher resolution and reliable streaming. High-quality video provides more enjoyable viewing experiences but causes streams to buffer for viewers with low bandwidth or older viewing devices. Streaming lower-bitrate video allows more people to watch the content seamlessly, but introduces artifacts.</p>
<p>Twitch — the interactive livestreaming platform — provides server-side transcoding for top-performing channels, meaning it will create different versions of the same stream for different bandwidth levels, improving the viewing experience. But the audience of many channels are left with a single stream option.</p>
<p>Twitch, OBS and NVIDIA have collaborated on a new feature to address this — Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting, releasing in beta later this month. Using the high-quality dedicated encoder (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-codec-sdk">NVENC</a>) in modern <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/">GeForce RTX and GTX GPUs</a>, streamers will be able to broadcast up to three resolutions simultaneously at up to 1080p.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting (Multi-Encode Streaming) Powered by NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMtA3fFnXZk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In the coming months, Enhanced Broadcasting beta testers will be able to experiment with higher-input bit rates, up to 4K resolutions, up to 5 concurrent streams, as well as new codecs. The new codecs include the latest-generation AV1 for GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, which provides 40% more encoding efficiency than H.264, and HEVC for previous-generation GeForce GPUs.</p>

<p>To simplify set up, Enhanced Broadcasting will automatically configure all OBS encoder settings, including resolution, bit rate and encoding parameters. A server-side algorithm will return the best possible configuration for OBS Studio based on the streamer’s setup, taking the headaches out of tuning settings for the best viewer experiences.</p>
<p>Using the dedicated NVENC hardware encoder, streamers can achieve the highest quality video across streaming bitrates, with minimal impact to app and game performance.</p>
<p>Sign up for the Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting beta today at twitch.tv/broadcast. Twitch will enroll participants on a first-come, first-served basis, starting later this month. Once a creator has been enrolled in the beta, they’ll receive an email with additional instructions.</p>

<figure id="attachment_69129" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69129" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69129" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Editing-APIs-1-672x378.jpg" alt="Generative AI by iStock Powered by Picasso Editing APIs" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Editing-APIs-1-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Editing-APIs-1-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Editing-APIs-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Editing-APIs-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Editing-APIs-1-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Editing-APIs-1-800x450.jpg 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Editing-APIs-1-382x215.jpg 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Editing-APIs-1-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Editing-APIs-1-1280x720.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69129" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Inpainting and outpainting APIs, with Replace feature coming soon.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>New editing APIs give customers powerful control over their generated images.</p>
<p>The Inpainting feature allows users to mask a region of an image, then fill in the region with a person or object described via a text prompt.</p>
<p>Outpainting enables users to expand images to fit various aspect ratios, filling in new areas based on the context of the original image. This is a powerful tool to create assets with unique aspect ratios for advertising or social media promotion.</p>
<p>And coming soon, a Replace feature provides similar capabilities to Inpainting but with stricter adherence to the mask.</p>
<h2><b>Transforming Visual Design</b></h2>
<p>The NVIDIA Picasso foundry enables developers and service providers to seamlessly train, fine-tune, optimize and deploy generative AI models tailored to their visual design requirements. Developers can use their own AI models or train new ones using the NVIDIA Edify model architecture to generate images, videos, 3D assets, 360-degree high-dynamic-range imaging and physically based rendering materials from simple text prompts.</p>
<p>Using NVIDIA Picasso, Getty Images trained a bespoke Edify image generator based on its catalog of licensed images and videos to power the Generative AI by iStock service.</p>
<p>Customers can use Generative AI by iStock online today. Advanced editing features are now available via APIs and coming soon to the iStock website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Whether building a super-capable truck or conjuring up a dream sports car, spending hours playing with online car configurators is easy.</p>
<p>With auto industry insiders predicting that most new vehicle purchases will move online by 2030, these configurators are more than just toys.</p>
<p>They’re crucial to the future of the world’s automakers — essential in showing off what their brand is all about, boosting average selling prices and helping customers select and personalize their vehicles.</p>
<p>It’s also a natural use case for the sophisticated simulation capabilities of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a software platform for developing and deploying advanced 3D applications and pipelines based on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">OpenUSD</a>. It provides the ability to instantly visualize changes to a car’s color or customize its interior with luxurious finishes.</p>
<p>Studies show that 80% of shoppers are drawn to brands that give them a personal touch while shopping.</p>
<p>Aiming to meet these customer demands, a burgeoning ecosystem of partners and customers is putting to work elements of Omniverse.</p>
<p>Key creative partners and developers like BITONE, Brickland, Configit, Katana Studio Ltd. (serving Craft Detroit), WPP and ZeroLight are pioneering Omniverse-powered configurators. And leading automakers such as Lotus are adopting these advanced solutions.</p>
<p>That’s because traditional auto configurators, often limited by pre-rendered images, experience difficulty achieving personalization and dynamic environment representation.</p>
<p>They use different kinds of data in various tools, such as static images of what users see on the website, lists of available options based on location, product codes and personal information.</p>
<p>These challenges extend from the consumer experience — often characterized by limited interactivity and realism — to back-end processes for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and agencies, where inflexibility and inefficiencies in updating configurators and repurposing assets are common.</p>
<h2><strong>Reconfiguring Configurators With NVIDIA Omniverse</strong></h2>
<p>Omniverse helps software developers and service providers streamline their work.</p>
<p>Service providers can now access the platform to craft state-of-the-art 3D experiences and showcase lifelike graphics and high-end, immersive environments with advanced lighting and textures.</p>
<p>And OEMs can benefit from a unified asset pipeline that simplifies the integration of design and engineering data for marketing purposes. Omniverse’s enhanced tools also allow them to quickly produce diverse marketing materials, boosting customer engagement through customized content.</p>
<p>Independent software vendors, or ISVs, can use the native OpenUSD platform as a foundation for creating scene construction tools — or to help develop tools for managing configuration variants.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/stream-3d-apps/">NVIDIA Graphics Delivery Network</a> (GDN) software development kit, high-quality, real-time <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a> viewports can be embedded into web applications, ensuring seamless operation on nearly any device.</p>
<p>This, along with support for large-scale scenes and physically accurate graphics, allows developers to concentrate on enhancing the user experience without compromising quality on lower-spec machines.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/cloud/">Omniverse Cloud</a> taps GDN, which uses NVIDIA’s global cloud-streaming infrastructure to deliver seamless access to high-fidelity 3D interactive experiences.</p>
<p>Configurators, when run on GDN, can be easily published at scale using the same GPU architecture on which they were developed and streamed to nearly any device.</p>
<p>All this means less redundancy in data prep, aggregated and accessible data, fewer manual pipeline updates and instant access for the entire intended audience.</p>
<h2><strong>Global Adoption by Innovators and Industry Leaders</strong></h2>
<p>Omniverse is powering a new era in automotive design and customer interaction, heralded by a vibrant ecosystem of partners and customers.</p>
<p>Lotus is at the forefront, developing an interactive dealership user experience using Omniverse and generative AI tools including <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/audio2face/">NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face</a>.</p>

<p>The Ultimate Day Pass will be available for $7.99 and the Priority Day Pass for $3.99. The 24 hours of continuous play will begin at purchase. Day Passes can be combined for continued access to GeForce NOW high-performance cloud streaming.</p>
<h2><b>Let That Sync In</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA continues to push the boundaries for cloud gaming. The Ultimate membership tier introduced many cloud gaming firsts, from 240 fps to ultra-wide streaming, making gameplay with GeForce NOW — streaming from GeForce RTX 4080-powered servers — nearly identical to a local gaming experience.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69083" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69083" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69083" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GeForce_NOW_Cloud_GSYNC-672x336.jpg" alt="Cloud GSYNC coming to GeForce NOW" width="672" height="336" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GeForce_NOW_Cloud_GSYNC-672x336.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GeForce_NOW_Cloud_GSYNC-400x200.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GeForce_NOW_Cloud_GSYNC-768x384.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GeForce_NOW_Cloud_GSYNC-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GeForce_NOW_Cloud_GSYNC-842x421.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GeForce_NOW_Cloud_GSYNC-406x203.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GeForce_NOW_Cloud_GSYNC-188x94.jpg 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GeForce_NOW_Cloud_GSYNC-1280x640.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GeForce_NOW_Cloud_GSYNC.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69083" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Get in sync.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming soon, cloud G-SYNC technology will raise the bar even further, minimizing stutter and latency, with support for variable refresh rate monitors and fully optimized for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/g-sync-monitors/specs/">G-SYNC-compatible monitors</a>. With Cloud G-SYNC enabled, GeForce NOW will vary the display’s refresh rates to match the streaming rate, for the smoothest gameplay experience available from the cloud.</p>
<p>Ultimate members can also soon take advantage of expanded NVIDIA Reflex support in supported titles.  Building off of 240fps 1080p streaming from last year, Ultimate members will soon be able to utilize Reflex in supported titles at up to 4K resolution and 60 or 120 fps streaming modes, for low-latency gaming on nearly any device.  NVIDIA Reflex support is available in the top PC games on GeForce NOW, including <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Cyberpunk 2077, Diablo IV, Overwatch 2, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, </i> <i>Alan Wake 2 </i>and more.</p>
<p>With both Cloud G-SYNC and Reflex, members will feel as if they’re connected directly to GeForce NOW’s RTX 4080 SuperPODs, making their visual experiences smoother, clearer and more immersive than ever.</p>
<h2><b>Mobile Phones Are Now PC Gaming Rigs</b></h2>
<p>Mobile gamers will soon have the option to set streaming resolution to 1440p on Android devices, providing richer graphics on larger screens. Members will be able to turn an Android device into a portable gaming rig with support for quad-high-definition resolution (2,560 x 1,440 pixels), as well as improved keyboard and mouse support.</p>
<p>This offers a glimpse into the future of game streaming, with external displays connected to a mobile device. Using a USB-C docking station, gamers can connect an Android phone to a 1080p or 1440p gaming monitor or TV, with a keyboard and mouse or gamepad.</p>
<p>Paired with a GeForce NOW Ultimate membership, Android phones become portable gaming rigs on which to play the latest triple-A PC games, such as <i>Baldur’s Gate 3</i>, <i>The Finals </i>and<i> Monster Hunter: World</i>. Now anything, even a phone, can be a high-performance gaming rig.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">Generative AI</a> is reshaping trillion-dollar industries, and NVIDIA, a front-runner in smart robotics, is seizing the moment.</p>
<p>Speaking today as part of a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/ces/">special address</a> ahead of CES, NVIDIA Vice President of Robotics and Edge Computing Deepu Talla detailed how NVIDIA and its partners are bringing generative AI and robotics together.</p>
<p>It’s a natural fit, with a growing roster of partners — including Boston Dynamics, Collaborative Robotics, Covariant, Sanctuary AI, Unitree Robotics and others — embracing GPU-accelerated <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">large language models</a> to bring unprecedented levels of intelligence and adaptability to machines of all kinds.</p>
<p>The timing couldn’t be better.</p>
<p>“Autonomous robots powered by artificial intelligence are being increasingly utilized for improving efficiency, decreasing costs and tackling labor shortages,” Talla said.</p>
<h2><b>Present at the Creation</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA has been central to the generative AI revolution from the beginning. <i><br />
</i><br />
A decade ago, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang hand-delivered the first <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-platform/">NVIDIA DGX</a> AI supercomputer to OpenAI. Now, thanks to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, generative AI has become one of the fastest-growing technologies of our time. <i><br />
</i><i><br />
</i>And it’s just getting started.</p>
<p>The impact of generative AI will go beyond text and image generation — and into homes and offices, farms and factories, hospitals and laboratories, Talla predicted.</p>
<p>The key: LLMs, akin to the brain’s language center, will let robots understand and respond to human instructions more naturally.</p>
<p>Such machines will be able to learn continuously from humans, from each other and from the world around them.</p>
<p>“Given these attributes, generative AI is well-suited for robotics,” Talla said.</p>
<h2><b>How Robots Are Using Generative AI</b></h2>
<p>Agility Robotics, NTT, and others are incorporating generative AI into their robots to help them understand text or voice commands. Robot vacuum cleaners from Dreame Technology are being trained in simulated living spaces created by generative AI models. And Electric Sheep is developing a world model for autonomous lawn mowing.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdwjXbb5QfE?si=5bNlW-EPdSGbt4nx" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
NVIDIA technologies such as the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/industries/robotics/">NVIDIA Isaac</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">Jetson</a> platforms, which facilitate the development and deployment of AI-powered robots, are <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/metropolis-jetson-isaac-robotics-edge-ai-developers/">already relied</a> on by more than 1.2 million developers and 10,000 customers and partners.</p>
<p>Many of them are at CES this week, including Analog Devices, Aurora Labs, Canonical, Dreame Innovation Technology, DriveU, e-con Systems, Ecotron, Enchanted Tools, GluxKind, Hesai Technology, Leopard Imaging, Segway-Ninebot, Nodar, Orbbec, Qt Group, Robosense, Spartan Radar, TDK Corporation, Telit, Unitree Robotics, Voyant Photonics and ZVISION Technologies Co., Ltd.</p>
<h2>Two Brains Are Better Than One</h2>
<p>In his talk at CES, Talla showed the dual-computer model (below) essential for deploying AI in robotics, demonstrating NVIDIA’s comprehensive approach to AI development and application.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69073" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Building-Smart.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="375" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Building-Smart.jpg 600w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Building-Smart-400x250.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Building-Smart-344x215.jpg 344w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Building-Smart-160x100.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
The first computer, referred to as an “AI factory,” is central to the creation and continuous improvement of AI models.</p>
<p>AI factories use NVIDIA’s data center compute infrastructure along with its AI and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platforms for the simulation and training of AI models.</p>
<p>The second computer represents the runtime environment of the robot.</p>
<p>This varies depending on the application: It could be in the cloud or a data center; in an on-premises server for tasks like defect inspection in semiconductor manufacturing; or within an autonomous machine equipped with multiple sensors and cameras.</p>
<h2>Generating Quality Assets and Scenes</h2>
<p>Talla also highlighted the role of LLMs in breaking down technical barriers, turning typical users into technical artists capable of creating complex robotics workcells or entire warehouse simulations.</p>
<p>With generative AI tools like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/picasso/">NVIDIA Picasso</a>, users can generate realistic 3D assets from simple text prompts and add them to digital scenes for dynamic and comprehensive robot training environments.</p>
<p>The same capability extends to creating diverse and physically accurate scenarios in Omniverse, enhancing the testing and training of robots to ensure real-world applicability.</p>
<p>This dovetails with the transformative potential of generative AI in reconfiguring the deployment of robots.</p>
<p>Traditionally, robots are purpose-built for specific tasks, and modifying them for different ones is a time-consuming process.</p>
<p>But advancements in LLMs and vision language models are eliminating this bottleneck, enabling more intuitive interactions with robots through natural language, Talla explained.</p>
<p>Such machines — adaptable and aware of the environment around them — will soon spill out across the world.</p>
<p><i>To learn more, attend a </i><a href="https://www.ces.tech/sessions-events/rd/rd03.aspx"><i>virtual CES session</i></a><i> and watch Talla’s full talk below.</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>An avid cyclist, Thomas Park knows the value of having lots of gears to maintain a smooth, fast ride.</p>
<p>So, when the software architect designed an AI inference platform to serve predictions for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s (OCI) Vision AI service, he picked <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/triton-inference-server/">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a>. That’s because it can shift up, down or sideways to handle virtually any AI model, framework and hardware and operating mode — quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>“The NVIDIA AI inference platform gives our worldwide cloud services customers tremendous flexibility in how they build and run their AI applications,” said Park, a Zurich-based computer engineer and competitive cycler who’s worked for four of the world’s largest cloud services providers.</p>
<p>Specifically, Triton reduced OCI’s total cost of ownership by 10%, increased prediction throughput up to 76% and reduced inference latency up to 51% for OCI Vision and Document Understanding Service models that were migrated to Triton. The services run globally across more than 45 regional data centers, according to <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/ai-and-datascience/post/oci-ai-vision-nvidia-triton-inference-server">an Oracle blog</a> Park and a colleague posted earlier this year.</p>
<h2><b>Computer Vision Accelerates Insights</b></h2>
<p>Customers rely on OCI Vision AI for a wide variety of object detection and image classification jobs. For instance, a U.S.-based transit agency uses it to automatically detect the number of vehicle axles passing by to calculate and bill bridge tolls, sparing busy truckers wait time at toll booths.</p>
<p>OCI AI is also available in Oracle NetSuite, a set of business applications used by more than 37,000 organizations worldwide. It’s used, for example, to automate invoice recognition.</p>
<p>Thanks to Park’s work, Triton is now being adopted across other OCI services, too.</p>
<h2><b>A Triton-Aware Data Service</b></h2>
<p>“<!--StartFragment --><span class="cf0">Our AI platform is Triton-aware for the benefit of our customers</span><!--EndFragment -->,” said Tzvi Keisar, a director of product management for OCI’s Data Science service, which handles machine learning for Oracle’s internal and external users.</p>
<p>“If customers want to use Triton, they don’t have to worry about the configuration because it will be done automatically by the service, launching a Triton-powered inference endpoint for them,” said Keisar.</p>
<p>Triton is included in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a>, a platform that provides full security and support businesses need — and it’s available on <a href="https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/listing/155314141">OCI Marketplace</a>.</p>
<h2><b>A Massive SaaS Platform</b></h2>
<p>OCI’s Data Science service is the machine learning platform for both Oracle NetSuite and Oracle Fusion Applications.</p>
<p>“These business application suites are massive, with tens of thousands of customers who are also building their frameworks on top of our service,” he said.</p>
<p>It’s a wide swath of mainly enterprise users in manufacturing, retail, transportation and other industries. They’re building and using AI models of nearly every shape and size.</p>
<p>Inference was one of the group’s first services, and Triton came on the team’s radar not long after its launch.</p>
<h2><b>A Best-in-Class Inference Framework</b></h2>
<p>“We saw Triton pick up in popularity as a best-in-class serving framework, so we started experimenting with it,” Keisar said. “We saw really good performance, and it closed a gap in our existing offerings, especially on multi-model inference — it’s the most versatile and advanced inferencing framework out there.”</p>
<p>Launched on OCI <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/ai-and-datascience/post/oci-nvidia-triton-inference-server">in March</a>, Triton has already attracted the attention of many internal teams at Oracle hoping to use it for inference jobs that require serving predictions from multiple AI models running concurrently.</p>
<p>“Triton has a very good track record and performance on multiple models deployed on a single endpoint,” he said.</p>
<h2><b>Accelerating the Future</b></h2>
<p>Looking ahead, Keisar’s team is evaluating <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt#inference">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a> software to supercharge inference on the complex large language models (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">LLMs</a>) that have captured the imagination of many users.</p>
<p>An active blogger, Keisar’s <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/ai-and-datascience/post/quantize-deploy-llama2-70b-costeffective-a10s-oci">latest article</a> detailed quantization techniques for running a Llama 2 LLM with a whopping 70 billion parameters on NVIDIA A10 Tensor Core GPUs.</p>
<p>“Even down to four-bit parameters, the quality of model outputs is still quite good,” he said. “Deploying on NVIDIA GPUs gives us the flexibility to find a good balance in latency, throughput and cost.”</p>
<p>After announcements this fall that Oracle is deploying the latest <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, H200 GPUs, L40S GPUs and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/">Grace Hopper Superchips</a>, it’s just the start of many accelerated efforts to come.</p>

<p>A new year means new creative opportunities and new <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i> beats.</p>
<p>Each week, featured <i>In the NVIDIA Studio </i>artists share their unique artwork and content creation processes, as well as how <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/">NVIDIA Studio</a> — a platform comprising <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/laptops-desktops/">fine-tuned hardware</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/software/">efficient software</a> powered by NVIDIA and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/laptops/?nvid=nv-int-bnr-419233#cid=_nv-int-bnr_en-us">GeForce RTX GPUs</a> — elevates their work.</p>
<p>This week’s featured 3D content creator, Pedro Soares, aka Blendeered, created a stunning NVIDIA-themed New Year’s celebration animation.</p>
<p>Plus, tune in to the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/ces/">NVIDIA Special Address at CES</a> on Monday, Jan. 8, at 8 a.m. PT for the latest on content creation, AI-related news and more.</p>
<h2><b>Blendeered’s Beguiling Renders </b></h2>
<p>Blendeered’s latest animation was inspired by NVIDIA and the power of technological innovation.</p>
<p>“The scene, <i>New Year’s,</i> showcases a futuristic city with all the buildings funneling to the center point,” said Blendeered. “This evokes the feeling of accelerating toward a brighter future, which is what NVIDIA is all about: taking tech to the next level, every day.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Portugal-based creator first conceptualized the scene.</p>
<p>“The futuristic city needed to give a sense of speed,” he said. He accomplished this using highlighted arrows, neon-green street lines and light beams on digital screens across various high-rise buildings.</p>
<p>Blendeered then built individual assets in Blender version 3.6 — by far his favorite 3D app, in case his stage name didn’t give it away.</p>
<p>“Blender captivates users with its friendly interface, speed, power, real-time rendering and vibrant community — and the best part is that it’s free!” he shared.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU</a> unlocked Blender Cycles’ <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ray-tracing/optix">RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing</a> in the viewport for interactive, photorealistic modeling sequences. He also textured and applied color schemes to his 3D assets in Blender.</p>
<p>Next, the artist began lighting the scene using the new Panorama feature in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/canvas/">NVIDIA Canvas</a> app. He tapped OptiX denoising to preview final render results in real time, speeding his workflow.</p>
<p>Available for GeForce RTX GPU owners and free to download, NVIDIA Canvas uses AI to turn brushstrokes into realistic landscape images for quick creation of backgrounds and concept exploration.</p>

<p>Blendeered generated a full, spherical, high-dynamic-range imaging (HDRi) backdrop for his computer-generated imagery workflows — based on AI rendering — with a few simple sketches. He then exported it as an HDR file and imported it into Blender. YouTuber Timo Helmers demonstrates this type of workflow in the video tutorial below.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Get unique HDRI backdrops for your CG renders.

<p>“NVIDIA Canvas is amazing software that allowed me to make an HDRi backdrop that fit my scene perfectly,” said Blendeered.</p>
<p>From there, he completed the animation process before exporting the files to Blackmagic Design’s DaVinci Resolve version 18.</p>

<p>DaVinci Resolve is a key app for GPU acceleration and AI-powered workflows. All of the AI effects in DaVinci Resolve version 18.6 run twice as fast on NVIDIA RTX GPUs with acceleration using the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt-getting-started">NVIDIA TensorRT</a> software development kit.</p>
<p>Blendeered’s post-production work included GPU-accelerated color grading, video editing and color scopes. And <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-codec-sdk">NVENC</a>, a GPU hardware accelerator engine for video decoding, enabled faster, smoother playback and scrubbing of high-resolution video files.</p>

<p>For the final export, the eighth generation NVENC worked together with the built-in dual encoders on the artist’s GeForce RTX 4090 GPU to generate video files twice as fast. For Blendeered, NVIDIA GPUs are the clear choice for content creation because they provide “power, efficiency and reliability.”</p>
<p>When asked to give advice for aspiring artists, Blendeered encouraged beginners to “embrace consistent practice, learn from failures, seek feedback and stay true to the inner artistic voice.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Whether abundant, endangered or extinct, animal species are the focus of countless AI-powered conservation projects.</p>
<p>These initiatives — accelerated using NVIDIA GPUs, deep learning software and robotics technology — are alerting conservationists to poaching threats, powering more sustainable aquaculture and helping scientists monitor coral reef health.</p>
<p>Take a safari through the NVIDIA Blog’s top animal stories of 2023 below.</p>
<p>As a bonus, discover how animals — whether beautiful butterflies, flashy fish or massive mammoths — are inspiring a herd of digital artists.</p>
<h2><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/conservation-ai-detects-threats-to-endangered-species/"><b>Protecting Pangolins From Poachers</b></a></h2>
<p>Conservation AI, a U.K.-based nonprofit, is preserving biodiversity with an edge AI platform that analyzes camera footage in real time to identify species of interest, rapidly alerting conservationists to threats such as wildfires or poachers.</p>
<p>Founded by researchers at Liverpool John Moores University, the nonprofit now has dozens of cameras deployed across the globe running an AI platform built using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a> modules, the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk">NVIDIA DeepStream</a> software development kit and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a>.</p>
<p>The AI software is being deployed in Uganda and South Africa to keep an eye on pangolins and rhinos at risk of being hunted by poachers.</p>

<h2><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/colossal-biosciences-de-extinct-woolly-mammoth-parabricks/"><b>Bringing Colossal Insights to a Woolly Problem</b></a></h2>
<p>Colossal Biosciences is tackling endangered species conservation and de-extinction using computational biology.</p>
<p>Using gene editing technology, AI models and the <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/clara/parabricks/latest/index.html">NVIDIA Parabricks software suite</a> for genomic analysis, scientists at Colossal are working to bring back the woolly mammoth, the dodo bird and the Tasmanian tiger — and protect dwindling species such as the African forest elephant.</p>
<p>After combining incomplete DNA sequences from extinct species’ bone samples with genomic data from closely related creatures, the team uses Parabricks for sequence alignment and variant calling — enabling them to complete analysis 12x faster.</p>
<h2><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gosmart-fish-farming-ai/"><b>Enabling Efficient Fish Farming</b></a></h2>
<p>GoSmart, a member of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a> program for cutting-edge startups and the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/intelligent-video-analytics-platform/">NVIDIA Metropolis</a> vision AI partner ecosystem, is deploying AI for more efficient and sustainable fish farming.</p>
<p>The company’s compact edge AI system, powered by the NVIDIA Jetson platform, analyzes a pond or tank’s temperature and oxygen levels, as well as the average weight and population distribution of fish — information farmers can use for decisions around fish feeding and harvesting.</p>
<p>The team is also adding AI models that analyze fish behavior and indicators of disease and plans to integrate its solution with autonomous feeding systems.</p>
<h2><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-for-coral-reef-conservation/"><b>AI Can See Your (Coral Reef) Halo</b></a></h2>
<p>Researchers at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa are analyzing satellite imagery using NVIDIA GPU-powered AI to track halos — the rings of sand that surround coral reefs — as a way to assess ecosystem health.</p>
<p>The presence of halos indicates that a coral reef has a healthy population of marine life, including fish and invertebrates. A change in their shape suggests a degrading environment that needs attention from conservationists.</p>
<p>The researchers’ AI tool, which runs on an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a6000/">NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU</a>, can analyze hundreds of coral reef halos in around two minutes, a task that would take 10 hours for a human to complete.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Coral-Reef-Halos.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-66706" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Coral-Reef-Halos-672x357.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="357" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Coral-Reef-Halos-672x357.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Coral-Reef-Halos-400x213.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Coral-Reef-Halos-768x408.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Coral-Reef-Halos-842x447.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Coral-Reef-Halos-406x215.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Coral-Reef-Halos-188x100.jpg 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Coral-Reef-Halos.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<h2><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/coral-reef-decline-curee-robot-jetson-isaac-omniverse/"><b>Reef-Roving Robot Tracks Undersea Life</b></a></h2>
<p>An autonomous underwater robot powered by the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX</a> module is roaming reef ecosystems to help scientists understand human impact on reefs and surrounding sea creatures.</p>
<p>Developed by researchers at MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution’s Autonomous Robotics and Perception Laboratory, the CUREE robot collects environmental data that informs 3D models of reefs.</p>
<p>The team developed an AI model called DeepSeeColor that cleans up blurry underwater footage to enable more accurate fish detection by another neural network. They’re also working on detection models to identify audio samples from different creatures.</p>
<h2><b>Fantastic Fauna: Animals Inspire AI-Powered Digital Art</b></h2>
<p>Greek philosopher Plato said that art imitates life — and digital art is no exception, as exemplified by artists who this year used NVIDIA technology to develop stunning animal-inspired visuals.</p>
<p>Honoring marine life, BBC Studios’ Alessandro Mastronardi created a series of incredibly <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/alessandro-mastronardi-blender-omniverse-broadcast/">realistic shark videos and renders</a> in Blender and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/creators/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform for connecting and building custom 3D tools and applications with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)</a>.</p>

<p>Taiwanese artist Steven Tung took a more whimsical approach in <i>The Given Fish</i>, an <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tung-msi-adobe-3d-painter-blender/">animation depicting stone fish</a> created using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Substance 3D Painter and Blender — all accelerated by an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU</a>-powered system.</p>
<p>London-based Dominic Harris used GPU-accelerated AI to render a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-artist-dominic-harris/">real-time collage of 13,000 imagined butterflies</a>, which exhibit-goers could make flutter or change color. And Keerthan Sathya, based in Bangalore, used the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platform to render a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/omniverse-usd-marvelous-designer-connector/">mammoth-themed animation</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Before ringing in the new year, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/">GeForce NOW</a> is taking a look back at a 2023 full of top-notch gaming. Explore GeForce NOW’s year in review, which brought more hit games, improved service features and the launch of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/memberships/">Ultimate membership</a> tier.</p>
<p>Plus, GFN Thursday is raising a toast to the GeForce NOW community by delivering more than 40 new games to stream from the cloud.</p>
<h2><b>Wrapping It Up</b></h2>
<p>It’s been an amazing year of cloud gaming. The launch of the Ultimate tier brought high-performance cloud gaming across North America and Europe, streaming from newly rolled out <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-jan-19/">GeForce RTX 4080 SuperPODs</a>.</p>
<p>For the first time in the cloud, members could stream up to 240 frames per second, or 4K 120 fps on the native PC and Mac apps, and experience support for ultrawide resolutions for the smoothest and most immersive gameplay — all thanks to the powerful <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/ada-lovelace-architecture/">NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPU architecture</a>.</p>
<p>To prove the power of the cloud, NVIDIA gave gamers the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-aug-17/">ultimate test</a> of latency on <i>KovaaK’s</i>, a latency-sensitive, first-person-shooter aim trainer.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-68965" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-672x372.jpeg" alt="GeForce NOW Kovaak's Ultimate Challenge Leaderboard" width="672" height="372" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-672x372.jpeg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-400x221.jpeg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-768x425.jpeg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-814x450.jpeg 814w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-389x215.jpeg 389w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-181x100.jpeg 181w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-1280x708.jpeg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard.jpeg 1441w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>Gamers competed for top scores on the leaderboard, and the results were staggering — showing a 1.8x improvement in aiming just by playing with an Ultimate membership.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GeForce NOW: Power The Cloud With Chromebook Plus" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yf-zZWkyfLM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA also posed a challenge to <i>Cyberpunk 2077 </i>fans: to play the graphics-intensive game on an unknown system. Players were astonished to discover that they were playing with full ray tracing on a Chromebook with GeForce NOW.
