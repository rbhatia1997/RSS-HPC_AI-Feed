										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>A new study underscores the potential of AI and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/">accelerated computing</a> to deliver <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/energy-efficiency/">energy efficiency</a> and combat climate change, efforts in which NVIDIA has long been deeply engaged.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://itif.org/publications/2024/01/29/rethinking-concerns-about-ai-energy-use/">study</a>, called “Rethinking Concerns About AI’s Energy Use,” provides a well-researched examination into how AI can — and in many cases already does — play a large role in addressing these critical needs.</p>
<p>Citing dozens of sources, the study from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a Washington-based think tank focused on science and technology policy, calls for governments to accelerate adoption of AI as a significant new tool to drive energy efficiency across many industries.</p>
<p>AI can help “reduce carbon emissions, support clean energy technologies, and address climate change,” it said.</p>
<h2><b>How AI Drives Energy Efficiency</b></h2>
<p>The report documents ways machine learning is already helping many sectors reduce their impact on the environment.</p>
<p>For example, it noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Farmers are using AI to lessen their use of fertilizer and water.</li>
<li>Utilities are adopting it to make the electric grid more efficient.</li>
<li>Logistics operations use it to optimize delivery routes, reducing the fuel consumption of their fleets.</li>
<li>Factories are deploying it to reduce waste and increase energy efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these and many other ways, the study argues that AI advances energy efficiency. So, it calls on policymakers “to ensure AI is part of the solution, not part of the problem, when it comes to the environment.”</p>
<p>It also recommends adopting AI broadly across government agencies to “help the public sector reduce carbon emissions through more efficient digital services, smart cities and buildings, intelligent transportation systems, and other AI-enabled efficiencies.”</p>
<h2><b>Reviewing the Data on AI</b></h2>
<p>The study’s author, Daniel Castro, saw in current predictions about AI a repeat of exaggerated forecasts that emerged during the rise of the internet more than two decades ago.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69584" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69584" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Daniel-Castro-ITIF-scaled.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-69584" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Daniel-Castro-ITIF-150x150.jpg" alt="Daniel Castro, ITIF" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69584" class="wp-caption-text">Daniel Castro</figcaption></figure>
<p>“People extrapolate from early studies, but don’t consider all the important variables including improvements you see over time in digitalization like energy efficiency,” said Castro, who leads ITIF’s Center for Data Innovation.</p>
<p>“The danger is policymakers could miss the big picture and hold back beneficial uses of AI that are having positive impacts, especially in regulated areas like healthcare,” he said.</p>
<p>“For example, we’ve had electronic health records since the 1980s, but it took focused government investments to get them deployed,” he added. “Now AI brings big opportunities for decarbonization across the government and the economy.”</p>
<h2><b>Optimizing Efficiency Across Data Centers</b></h2>
<p>Data centers of every size have a part to play in maximizing their energy efficiency with AI and accelerated computing.</p>
<p>For instance, NVIDIA’s AI-based weather-prediction model, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11214">FourCastNet</a>, is about 45,000x faster and consumes 12,000x less energy to produce a forecast than current techniques. That promises efficiency boosts for supercomputers around the world that run continuously to provide regional forecasts, Bjorn Stevens, director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, said in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-efficient-weather-predictions/">a blog</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, data centers could save a whopping 19 terawatt-hours of electricity a year if all AI, high performance computing and networking offloads were run on GPU and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/whats-a-dpu-data-processing-unit/">DPU</a> accelerators instead of CPUs, according to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-green-computing/">NVIDIA’s calculations</a>. That’s the equivalent of the energy consumption of 2.9 million passenger cars driven for a year.</p>
<p>Last year, the U.S. Department of Energy’s lead facility for open science documented its advances with accelerated computing.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, energy efficiency improved 5x on average across four key scientific applications <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gpu-energy-efficiency-nersc/">in tests</a> at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. An application for weather forecasting logged gains of nearly 10x.</p>

<h2><b>AI, Accelerated Computing Advance Climate Science</b></h2>
<p>The combination of accelerated computing and AI is creating new scientific instruments to help understand and combat climate change.</p>
<p>In 2021, NVIDIA <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/earth-2-supercomputer/">announced</a> Earth-2, an initiative to build a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/">digital twin</a> of Earth on a supercomputer capable of simulating climate on a global scale. It’s among a handful of similarly <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/digital-twins-climate-collaboration/">ambitious efforts</a> around the world.</p>
<p>An example is <a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/what-we-do/environmental-services-and-future-vision/destination-earth">Destination Earth</a>, a pan-European project to create digital twins of the planet, that’s using accelerated computing, AI and “collaboration on an unprecedented scale,” said the project’s leader, Peter Bauer, a veteran with more than 20 years at Europe’s top weather-forecasting center.</p>
<p>Experts in the utility sector agree AI is key to advancing sustainability.</p>
<p>“AI will play a crucial role maintaining stability for an electric grid that’s becoming exponentially more complex with large numbers of low-capacity, variable generation sources like wind and solar coming online, and two-way power flowing into and out of houses,” said Jeremy Renshaw, a senior program manager at the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent nonprofit that collaborates with more than 450 companies in 45 countries, in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-energy-grids/">a blog</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Here’s some news to still beating hearts: AI is helping bring some clarity to cardiology. <a href="https://www.caristo.com/">Caristo Diagnostics</a> has developed an AI-powered solution for detecting coronary inflammation in cardiac CT scans. In this episode of NVIDIA’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/ai-podcast/">AI Podcast</a>, Dr. Keith Channon, the Field Marshal Earl Alexander Professor at the University of Oxford, and the cofounder and chief medical officer at the startup, speaks with host Noah Kravtiz about the technology. Called Caristo, it analyzes radiometric features in CT scan data to identify inflammation in the fat tissue surrounding coronary arteries, a key indicator of heart disease. Tune in to learn more about how Caristo uses AI to improve treatment plans and risk predictions by providing physicians with a patient-specific readout of inflammation levels.</p>

</b><b></b></a>What if we could map our immune system to create drugs that can help our bodies win the fight against cancer and other diseases? That’s the big idea behind immunotherapy. The problem: the immune system is incredibly complex. Enter Immunai, a biotechnology company using AI technology to map the human immune system and speed the development of new immunotherapies against cancer and autoimmune diseases.</p>

</a>It may seem intuitive that AI and deep learning can speed up workflows — including novel drug discovery, a typically years-long and several-billion-dollar endeavor. But, professors Artem Cherkasov and Olexandr Isayev were surprised that no recent academic papers provided a comprehensive, global research review of how deep learning and GPU-accelerated computing impact drug discovery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Asia’s lion city is roaring ahead in AI.</p>
<p>Singtel, a leading communications services provider based in Singapore, will bring the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/">NVIDIA AI platform</a> to businesses in the island nation and beyond.</p>
<p>The mobile and broadband company is building energy-efficient data centers across Southeast Asia accelerated with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/hopper-architecture/">NVIDIA Hopper architecture GPUs</a> and using NVIDIA AI reference architectures proven to deliver optimal performance.</p>
<p>The data centers will serve as sovereign national resources — AI factories that process the private datasets of companies, startups, universities and governments safely on shore to produce valuable insights.</p>
<p>Singtel’s first AI services will spin up in Singapore, with future data centers under construction in Indonesia and Thailand. From its hub in Singapore, the company has operations that stretch from Australia to India.</p>
<h2><b>Trusted Engines of AI</b></h2>
<p>The new data centers will act as trusted engines of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>. The most transformative technology of our time, generative AI and its ability to amplify human intelligence and productivity are attracting users worldwide.</p>
<p>Nations are creating <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language models</a> tuned to their local dialects, cultures and practices. Singtel sits at the center of such opportunities among Southeast Asia’s vibrant Chinese, Indian, Malay and other communities.</p>
<p>Singtel’s initiative supports Singapore’s national AI strategy to empower its citizens with the latest technology. The plan calls for significantly expanding the country’s compute infrastructure as well as its talent pool of machine learning specialists.</p>
<p>For businesses in the region, having a known, local provider of these computationally intensive services provides a safe, easy on-ramp to generative AI. They can enhance and personalize their products and services while protecting sensitive corporate data.</p>
<h2><b>Taking the Green Path</b></h2>
<p>Singtel is committed to democratizing AI and decarbonizing its operations.</p>
<p>Its latest data centers are being built with an eye to sustainability, including in the selection of materials and use of liquid cooling. They adopt best practices to deliver less than 1.3 in PUE, the power usage effectiveness metric for data center efficiency.</p>
<p>Singtel will use its Paragon software platform to orchestrate how the new AI applications work in concert with its mobile and broadband services. The combination will enable <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-edge-computing/">edge computing</a> services like powering robots and other autonomous systems from AI models running in the cloud.</p>
<h2><b>A Full-Stack Foundation</b></h2>
<p>The company will offer its customers <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a>, a software platform for building and deploying AI applications, including generative AI. Singtel will also be an NVIDIA Cloud Partner, delivering optimized AI services on the NVIDIA platform.</p>
<p>Because Singtel’s data centers use NVIDIA’s proven reference architectures for AI computing, users can employ its services, knowing they’re optimized for leading AI performance.</p>

<h2><b>Stepping Into Magical Worlds</b></h2>
<p>Tieh’s scene began as a sketch of what he envisioned to be a giant door in a grassy field.</p>
<p>“A very broad and abstract thought — but that’s sort of the point of fantasy,” he explained.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69494" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-69494 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w-672x270.png" alt="" width="672" height="270" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w-672x270.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w-400x161.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w-768x309.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w-842x339.png 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w-406x163.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w-188x76.png 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69494" class="wp-caption-text">Tieh specializes in building impressive worlds.</figcaption></figure>
<p>To bring it to life, he began by gathering assets such as rocks and grass from Quixel Megascans, the Unreal Engine Marketplace and ArtStation Marketplace.</p>
<p>The door required extra customization, so he modeled one from scratch, first sculpting it in ZBrush before importing it into Adobe 3D Substance Painter for a quick texture pass. Tieh’s GeForce RTX graphics card used RTX-accelerated light and ambient occlusion to bake assets in mere seconds.</p>

<p>Next, Tieh tackled modeling the obelisks and pillars in Blender, where RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport ensured highly interactive, photorealistic rendering.</p>

<p>He then unwrapped his 3D assets onto a 2D plane, where he applied textures to the model’s surfaces to enhance realism — a key process called UV unwrapping.</p>

<p>With the textured assets in place, Tieh next built the scene in Unreal Engine. His technique involves focusing on the big shapes by looking at the scene in a smaller thumbnail view, then flipping the canvas to refresh his perspective — very similar to the approach concept artists use. He adjusted lighting by deploying the same technique.</p>

<p>Unreal Engine users can tap <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS</a> Super Resolution to increase the interactivity of the viewport by using AI to upscale frames rendered at lower resolution, and enhance image quality using DLSS Ray Reconstruction.</p>
<p>Fog is another major component of the scene. “Fog is generally darker and more opaque in the background and becomes lighter and more translucent as it approaches the foreground,” said Tieh. He primarily used fog cards in Unreal Engine’s free Blueprints Visual Scripting system to add a paint-like effect.</p>
<p>The majority of lighting was artificial, meaning Tieh had to use a significant number of individually placed light sources, but “it looks very believable if executed well,” he explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Hip disorders, comprising some of the world’s most common joint diseases, are especially prevalent among adolescents and young adults, causing stiffness, pain or a limp. But they can be hard to diagnose using solely 2D medical imaging.</p>
<p>Helping to treat these disorders, the Boston Children’s Hospital’s (BCH’s) Adolescent and Young Adult Hip Preservation Program is the U.S.’s first to deploy a fully automated AI tool across its clinic.</p>
<p>Called VirtualHip, the tool can create a 3D model of a hip from routine medical images, assess anatomy and movement-related issues, and provide clinicians with diagnostic and treatment guidance. It was built at an orthopedic research lab at BCH, Harvard Medical School’s primary pediatric hospital, using the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DGX platform</a>.</p>
<p>A team of 10 researchers are working on the project, funded in part by an <a href="https://nvidia.my.site.com/HardwareGrant/s/Application" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Academic Hardware Grant</a>, including engineers, computer scientists, orthopedic surgeons, radiologists and software developers.</p>
<p>“Using AI, clinicians can get more value out of the clinical data they routinely collect,” said Dr. Ata Kiapour, the lab’s principal investigator, director of the musculoskeletal informatics group at BCH and assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Harvard Medical School. “This tool can augment their performance to make better choices in diagnosis and treatment, and free their time to focus on giving patients the best care.”</p>
<h2><b>Getting Straight to the Joint</b></h2>
<p>Often, clinicians must determine a treatment plan — with levels of intervention ranging from physical therapy to total hip replacement — based on just a 2D image, such as an X-ray, CT scan or MRI. Automatically creating 3D models from these images, and using them to conduct comprehensive joint assessments, can help improve the accuracy of diagnosis to inform treatment planning.</p>
<p>“I started a postdoc with an orthopedic surgeon at BCH in 2013, when I saw how an engineer or scientist could help with patient treatment,” said Dr. Kiapour, who’s also trained as a biomedical engineer. “Over the years, I saw that hospitals have a ton of data, but efficient data processing for clinical use was a huge, unmet need.”</p>
<p>VirtualHip, fully integrated with BCH’s hip clinic and radiology database, helps to fill this gap.</p>
<p>Clinicians can log in to the software tool through a web-based portal, view and interact with 3D simulations of 2D medical images, submit analysis requests and see results within an hour — 4x quicker on average than receiving a radiology report after imaging.</p>
<p>The tool, which produces 3D models with a margin of error less than one millimeter, can assess morphological abnormalities and identify issues related to hip motion, such as pain from hip bones rubbing against each other.</p>
<p>VirtualHip was developed using a database with tens of millions of clinical notes and imaging data from patients seen at BCH over the past two decades. Using natural language processing models and computer vision algorithms, Dr. Kiapour’s team processed this data, training the tool to analyze normal versus pathologic hip development and identify factors influencing the injury risk and treatment outcomes.</p>
<p>This will enable VirtualHip to offer patient-specific risk assessment and treatment planning by comparing current patients to previously treated ones with similar demographic backgrounds.</p>
<p>“The hardware support that we got from NVIDIA made all of this possible,” Dr. Kiapour said. “DGX enabled advanced computations on more than 20 years’ worth of historical data for our fine-tuned clinical AI model.”</p>
<h2><b>Clearer Explanations, Better Outcomes for Patients</b></h2>
<p>In addition to assisting doctors in diagnosis and treatment planning, VirtualHip helps patients better understand their condition.</p>
<p>“When patients look at an X-ray, it doesn’t look like a real hip — but with a 3D model that can be rotated, the doctor can show exactly where the joints are impinging or unstable,” Dr. Kiapour said. “This lets the patient better understand their disorder, which usually makes them more compliant with whatever the doctor’s prescribing.”</p>
<p>This type of visualization is especially helpful for children and younger adults, Kiapour added.</p>
<p>The VirtualHip project is under continuous development, including work toward a patient-facing platform — using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language models</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> — for personalized analyses and treatment recommendations.</p>
<p>The BCH researchers plan to commercialize the product for use in other hospitals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>In a major stride toward building a shared national research infrastructure, the U.S. National Science Foundation has launched the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource pilot program with significant support from NVIDIA.</p>
<p>The initiative aims to broaden access to the tools needed to power responsible AI discovery and innovation. It was announced Wednesday in partnership with 10 other federal agencies as well as private-sector, nonprofit and philanthropic organizations.</p>
<p>“The breadth of partners that have come together for this pilot underscores the urgency of developing a National AI Research Resource for the future of AI in America,” said NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. “By investing in AI research through the NAIRR pilot, the United States unleashes discovery and impact and bolsters its global competitiveness.”</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s commitment of $30 million in technology contributions over two years is a key factor in enlarging the scale of the pilot, fueling the potential for broader achievements and accelerating the momentum toward full-scale implementation.</p>
<p>“The NAIRR is a vision of a national research infrastructure that will provide access to computing, data, models and software to empower researchers and communities,” said Katie Antypas, director of the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure at the NSF.</p>
<p>“Our primary goals for the NAIRR pilot are to support fundamental AI research and domain-specific research applying AI, reach broader communities, particularly those currently unable to participate in the AI innovation ecosystem, and refine the design for the future full NAIRR,” Antypas added.</p>
<h2>Accelerating Access to AI</h2>
<p>“AI is increasingly defining our era, and its potential can best be fulfilled with broad access to its transformative capabilities,” said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang.</p>
<p>“Partnerships are really at the core of the NAIRR pilot,” said Tess DeBlanc-Knowles, NSF’s special assistant to the director for artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>“It’s been incredibly impressive to see this breadth of partners come together in these 90 days, bringing together government, industry, nonprofits and philanthropies,” she added. “Our industry and nonprofit partners are bringing critical expertise and resources, which are essential to advance AI and move forward with trustworthy AI initiatives.”</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s collaboration with scientific centers aims to significantly scale up educational and workforce training programs, enhancing AI literacy and skill development across the scientific community.</p>
<p>NVIDIA will harness insights from researchers using its platform, offering an opportunity to refine and enhance the effectiveness of its technology for science, and supporting continuous advancement in AI applications.</p>
<p>“With NVIDIA AI software and supercomputing, the scientists, researchers and engineers of the extended NSF community will be able to utilize the world’s leading infrastructure to fuel a new generation of innovation,” Huang said.</p>
<h2>The Foundation for Modern AI</h2>
<p>Accelerating both AI research and research done with AI, NVIDIA’s contributions include <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a> AI supercomputing resources and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software.</p>
<p>Offering full-stack accelerated computing from systems to software, NVIDIA AI provides the foundation for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>, with significant adoption across research and industries.</p>
<h2>Broad Support Across the US Government</h2>
<p>As part of this national endeavor, the NAIRR pilot brings together a coalition of government partners, showcasing a unified approach to advancing AI research.</p>
<p>Its partners include the U.S. National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Standards and Technology, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, U.S. Patent and Trade Office and the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
<p>The NAIRR pilot builds on the United States’ rich history of leading large-scale scientific endeavors, such as the creation of the internet, which, in turn, led to the advancement of AI.</p>
<h2>Leading in Advanced AI</h2>
<p>NAIRR promises to drive innovations across various sectors, from healthcare to environmental science, positioning the U.S. at the forefront of global AI advancements.</p>
<p>The launch meets a goal outlined in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Executive Order 14110</a>, signed by President Biden in October 2023, directing NSF to launch a pilot for the NAIRR within 90 days.</p>
<p>The NAIRR pilot will provide access to advanced computing, datasets, models, software, training and user support to U.S.-based researchers and educators.</p>
<p>“Smaller institutions, rural institutions, institutions serving underrepresented populations are key communities we’re trying to reach with the NAIRR,” said Antypas. “These communities are less likely to have resources to build their own computing or data resources.”</p>
<h2>Paving the Way for Future Investments</h2>
<p>As the pilot expedites the proof of concept, future investments in the NAIRR will democratize access to AI innovation and support critical work advancing the development of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/trustworthy-ai/">trustworthy AI</a>.</p>
<p>The pilot will initially support AI research to advance safe, secure and trustworthy AI as well as the application of AI to challenges in healthcare and environmental and infrastructure sustainability.</p>
<p>Researchers can apply for initial access to NAIRR pilot resources <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/news/democratizing-future-ai-rd-nsf-launch-national-ai">through the NSF</a>. The NAIRR pilot welcomes additional private-sector and nonprofit partners.</p>
<p>Those interested are encouraged to reach out to NSF at <a href="mailto:nairr_pilot@nsf.gov">nairr_pilot@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<h2><b>Leveling Up With RTX</b></h2>
<p>Vishal Ranga has a decade’s worth of experience in the gaming industry, where he pursues level design.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve loved playing video games since forever, and that curiosity led me to game design,” he said. “A few years later, I found my sweet spot in technical art.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_69434" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69434" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69434" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-a3-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69434" class="wp-caption-text">Ranga specializes in level design.</figcaption></figure>
<p>His stunning scene <i>Disowned </i>was born out of experimentation with Unreal Engine’s new ray-traced global illumination lighting capabilities.</p>
<p>Remarkably, he skipped the concepting process — the entire project was conceived solely from Ranga’s imagination.</p>
<p>Applying the water shader and mocking up the lighting early helped Ranga set up the mood of the scene. He then updated old assets and searched the Unreal Engine store for new ones — what he couldn’t find, like fishing nets and custom flags, he created from scratch.</p>

<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>“I chose a GeForce RTX GPU to use ray-traced dynamic global illumination with RTX cards for natural, more realistic light bounces.” — Vishal Ranga</p>
</div>
<p>Ranga’s GeForce RTX graphics card unlocked RTX-accelerated rendering for high-fidelity, interactive visualization of 3D designs during virtual production.</p>
<p>Next, he tackled shader work, blending in moss and muck into models of wood, nets and flags. He also created a volumetric local fog shader to complement the assets as they pass through the fog, adding greater depth to the scene.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69428" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69428" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69428" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0004-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69428" class="wp-caption-text">Shaders add extraordinary depth and visual detail.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ranga then polished everything up. He first used a water shader to add realism to reflections, surface moss and subtle waves, then tinkered with global illumination and reflection effects, along with other post-process settings.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69425" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69425" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0002-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69425" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0002-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0002-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0002-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0002-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0002-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0002-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0002-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-0002-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69425" class="wp-caption-text">Materials come together to deliver realism and higher visual quality.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ranga used Unreal Engine’s internal high-resolution screenshot feature and sequencer to capture renders. This was achieved by cranking up screen resolution to 200%, resulting in crisper details.</p>

<p>At CES, NVIDIA invited industry leaders to share their perspectives on how technology, especially AI and computing power, is shaping the future of transportation.</p>
<p>Watch the video to learn more from NVIDIA’s auto partners.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA DRIVE Partners Showcase Cutting-Edge Innovations in Automated and Autonomous Driving" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBjcI-OrI2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Redefining Possibilities Through Partnership</strong></h2>
<p>Magnus Ostberg, chief software officer at Mercedes-Benz, underscores how the company’s partnership with NVIDIA helps push technological boundaries. “[NVIDIA] enables us to go further to bring automated driving to the next level and into areas that we couldn’t go before,” he says.</p>
<h2><strong>Computing Power: The Driving Force Behind Autonomy</strong></h2>
<p>Shawn Kerrigan, chief operating officer and cofounder at Plus, emphasizes the role of computing power, saying, “Autonomous technology requires immense computing power in order to really understand the world around it and make safe driving decisions.”</p>
<p>“What was impossible to do previously because computing wasn’t strong enough is now doable,” says Eran Ofir, CEO of Imagry. “This is an enabler for the progress of the autonomous driving industry.”</p>
<p>“We wanted a platform that has a track record of being deployed in the automotive industry,” adds Stefan Solyom, chief technology officer at Pebble. “This is what NVIDIA can give us.”</p>
<p>And Martin Kristensson, head of product strategy at Volvo Cars, says, “We partner with NVIDIA to get the best compute that we can. More compute in the car means that we can be more aware of the environment around us and reacting earlier and being even safer.”</p>
<h2><strong>The Critical Role of AI</strong></h2>
<p>Don Burnette, CEO and founder of Kodiak Robotics, states, “NVIDIA makes best-in-class hardware accelerators, and I think it’s going to play a large role in the AI developments for self-driving going forward.”</p>
<p>“Driving as a routine task is tedious,” adds Tony Han, CEO and cofounder of WeRide. “We want to alleviate people from the burden of driving to give back the time. NVIDIA is the backbone of our AI engine.”</p>
<p>And Thomas Ingenlath, CEO of Polestar, says, “Our Polestar 3 sits on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. This is, of course, very much based on AI technology — and it’s really fascinating and a completely new era for the car.”</p>
<h2><strong>Simulation Is Key</strong></h2>
<p>Ziv Binyamini, CEO of Foretellix, highlights the role of simulation in development and verification. “Simulation is crucial for the development of autonomous systems,” he says.</p>
<p>Bruce Baumgartner, vice president of supply chain at Zoox, adds, “We have been leveraging NVIDIA’s technology first and foremost on-vehicle to power the Zoox driver. We also leverage NVIDIA technologies in our cloud infrastructure. In particular, we do a lot of work in our simulator.”</p>
<h2><strong>Saving Lives With Autonomy</strong><i><br />
</i><i></i></h2>
<p>Austin Russell, CEO and founder of Luminar, highlights the opportunity to save lives by using new technology, saying, “The DRIVE platform has been incredibly helpful to be able to actually enable autonomous driving capabilities as well as enhance safety capabilities on vehicles. To be able to have an opportunity to save as many as 100 million lives and 100 trillion hours of people’s time over the next 100 years — everything that we do at the company rolls up to that.”</p>
<p>“Knowing that [our technology] is in vehicles worldwide and saves lives on the road each and every day — the impact that you deliver as you keep people and family safe is amazingly rewarding,” adds Tal Krzypow, vice president of product and strategy at Cipia.</p>
<h2><strong>Technology Helps Solve Major Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>Shiv Tasker, global industry vice president at Capgemini, reflects on the role of technology in addressing global challenges, saying, “Our modern world is driven by technology, and yet we face tremendous challenges. Technology is the answer. We have to solve the major issues so that we leave a better place for our children and our grandchildren.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>It’s hard to imagine an industry more competitive — or fast-paced — than online retail.</p>
<p>Sellers need to create attractive and informative product listings that must be engaging, capture attention and generate trust.</p>
<p>Amazon uses optimized containers on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs</a> to power a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> tool that finds this balance at the speed of modern retail.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/small-business/amazon-sellers-generative-ai-tool">Amazon’s new generative AI capabilities help sellers seamlessly create compelling </a>titles, bullet points, descriptions, and product attributes.</p>
<p>To get started, Amazon identifies listings where content could be improved and leverages generative AI to generate high-quality content automatically. Sellers review the generated content and can provide feedback if they want to or accept the content changes to the Amazon catalog.</p>
<p>Previously, creating detailed product listings required significant time and effort for sellers, but this simplified process gives them more time to focus on other tasks.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-inference-on-llms-with-tensorrt-llm-now-publicly-available/">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a> software is available today on <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM">GitHub</a> and can be accessed through <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a>, which offers enterprise-grade security, support, and reliability for production AI.</p>
<p>TensorRT-LLM open-source software makes AI inference faster and smarter. It works with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/">large language models</a>, such as Amazon’s models for the above capabilities, which are trained on vast amounts of text.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, TensorRT-LLM enables up to an <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-supercharges-large-language-model-inference-on-nvidia-h100-gpus/">8x speedup on foundation</a> LLMs such as Llama 1 and 2, Falcon, Mistral, MPT, ChatGLM, Starcoder and more.</p>
<p>It also supports multi-GPU and multi-node inference, in-flight batching, paged attention, and Hopper <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/h100-transformer-engine/">Transformer Engine</a> with FP8 precision; all of which improves latencies and efficiency for the seller experience.</p>
<p>By using TensorRT-LLM and NVIDIA GPUs, Amazon improved its generative AI tool’s inference efficiency in terms of cost or GPUs needed by 2x, and reduced inference latency by 3x compared with an earlier implementation without TensorRT-LLM.</p>
<p>The efficiency gains make it more environmentally friendly, and the 3x latency improvement makes Amazon Catalog’s generative capabilities more responsive.</p>
<p>The generative AI capabilities can save sellers time and provide richer information with less effort. For example, it can enrich a listing for a wireless mouse with an ergonomic design, long battery life, adjustable cursor settings, and compatibility with various devices. It can also generate product attributes such as color, size, weight, and material. These details can help customers make informed decisions and reduce returns.</p>
<p>With generative AI, Amazon’s sellers can quickly and easily create more engaging listings, while being more energy efficient, making it possible to reach more customers and grow their business faster.</p>
<p><i>Developers can start with </i><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-inference-on-llms-with-tensorrt-llm-now-publicly-available/"><i>TensorRT-LLM</i></a><i> today, with enterprise support available through NVIDIA AI Enterprise.</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Mark Swinnerton aims to fight climate change by transforming abandoned mines into storage tanks of renewable energy.</p>
<p>The CEO of startup Green Gravity is prototyping his ambitious vision in a warehouse 60 miles south of Sydney, Australia, and simulating it in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform for building 3D workflows and applications.</p>
<p>The concept requires some heavy lifting. Solar and wind energy will pull steel blocks weighing as much as 30 cars each up shafts taller than a New York skyscraper, storing potential energy that can turn turbines whenever needed.</p>
<h2><b>A Distributed Energy Network</b></h2>
<p>Swinnerton believes it’s the optimal way to save renewable energy because nearly a million abandoned mine shafts are scattered around the globe, many of them already connected to the grid. And his mechanical system is cheaper and greener than alternatives like massive lithium batteries better suited for electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Officials in Australia, India and the U.S. are interested in the concept, and a state-owned mine operator in Romania is conducting a joint study with Green Gravity.</p>
<p>“We have a tremendous opportunity for repurposing a million mines,” said Swinnerton, who switched gears after a 20-year career at BHP Group, one of the world’s largest mining companies, determined to combat climate change.</p>
<h2><b>A Digital-First Design</b></h2>
<p>A longtime acquaintance saw an opportunity to accelerate Swinnerton’s efforts with a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/">digital twin</a>.</p>
<p>“I was fascinated by the Green Gravity idea and suggested taking a digital-first approach, using data as a differentiator,” said Daniel Keys, an IT expert and executive at <a href="https://xamplify.com.au/">xAmplify</a>, a provider of accelerated computing services.</p>
<p>AI-powered simulations could speed the design and deployment of the novel concept, said Keys, who met Swinnerton 25 years earlier at one of their first jobs, flipping burgers at a fast-food stand.</p>
<p>Today, they’ve got a digital prototype cooking on xAmplify’s Scaile computer, based on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-platform/">NVIDIA DGX systems</a>. It’s already accelerating Green Gravity’s proof of concept.</p>
<p>“Thanks to what we inferred with a digital twin, we’ve been able to save 40% of the costs of our physical prototype by shifting from three weights to two and moving them 10 instead of 15 meters vertically,” said Swinnerton.</p>
<h2><b>Use Cases Enabled by Omniverse</b></h2>
<p>It’s the first of many use cases Green Gravity is developing in Omniverse.</p>
<p>Once the prototype is done, the simulation will help scale the design to mines as deep as 7,000 feet, or about six Empire State Buildings stacked on top of each other. Ultimately, the team will build in Omniverse a dashboard to control and monitor sensor-studded facilities without the safety hazards of sending a person into the mine.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69367" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69367" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-672x367.jpg" alt="Green Gravity’s physical prototype and test lab." width="672" height="367" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-672x367.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-400x218.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-768x419.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-1536x838.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-825x450.jpg 825w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-394x215.jpg 394w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-183x100.jpg 183w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab-1280x698.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Gravity-test-lab.jpg 1833w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69367" class="wp-caption-text">Green Gravity’s physical prototype and test lab.</figcaption></figure>
<p>“We expect to cut tens of millions of dollars off the estimated $100 million for the first site because we can use simulations to lower our risks with banks and insurers,” said Swinnerton. “That’s a real tantalizing opportunity.”</p>
<h2><b>Virtual Visualization Tools</b></h2>
<p>Operators will track facilities remotely using visualization systems equipped with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a40/">NVIDIA A40 GPUs</a> and can stream their visuals to tablets thanks to the TabletAR extension in the Omniverse Spatial Framework.</p>
<p>xAmplify’s workflow uses a number of software components such as <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus">NVIDIA Modulus</a>, a framework for physics-informed machine learning models.</p>
<p>“We also use Omniverse as a core integration fabric that lets us connect a half-dozen third-party tools operators and developers need, like Siemens PLM for sensor management and Autodesk for design,” Keys said.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Green Gravity at Nvidia Day 2023 SIGGRAPH" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/902088869?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p>
<p>Omniverse eases the job of integrating third-party applications into one 3D workflow because it’s based on the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/openusd-alliance-3d-standard/">OpenUSD standard</a>.</p>
<p>Along the way, AI sifts reams of data about the thousands of available mines to select optimal sites, predicting their potential for energy storage. Machine learning will also help optimize designs for each site.</p>
<p>Taken together, it’s a digital pathway Swinnerton believes will lead to commercial operations for Green Gravity within the next couple years.</p>

<p>DigitalPath is igniting change in the Golden State — using computer vision, generative adversarial networks and a network of thousands of cameras to detect signs of fire in real time.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/ai-podcast/">NVIDIA’s AI Podcast</a>, host Noah Kravtiz spoke with DigitalPath System Architect Ethan Higgins about the company’s role in the ALERTCalifornia initiative, a collaboration between California’s wildfire fighting agency <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/">CAL FIRE</a> and the University of California, San Diego.</p>
<p>DigitalPath built computer vision models to process images collected from network cameras — anywhere from 8 million to 16 million a day — intelligently identifying signs of fire like smoke.</p>
<p>“One of the things we realized early on, though, is that it’s not necessarily a problem about just detecting a fire in a picture,” Higgins said. “It’s a process of making a manageable amount of data to handle.”</p>
<p>That’s because, he explained, it’s unlikely that humans will be entirely out of the loop in the detection process for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The company uses various AI algorithms to classify images based on whether they should be reviewed or acted upon — if so, an alert is sent out to a CAL FIRE command center.</p>
<p>One of the downsides to using computer vision to detect wildfires is that extinguishing more fires means a greater buildup of natural fuel and the potential for larger wildfires in the long term. DigitalPath and UCSD are exploring the use of high-resolution lidar data to identify where those fuels can be released in the form of prescribed burns.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Higgins foresees the field tapping generative AI to accelerate new simulation tools and using AI models to analyze the output of other models to doubly improve wildfire prediction and detection.</p>
<p>“AI is not perfect, but when you couple multiple models together, it can get really close,” he said.</p>

<p>As part of a movement to protect such languages, New Zealand’s <a href="https://tehiku.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Te Hiku Media</a>, a broadcaster focused on the Māori people’s indigenous language known as te reo, is using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/trustworthy-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trustworthy AI</a> to help preserve and revitalize the tongue.</p>
<p>Using ethical, transparent methods of speech data collection and analysis to maintain data sovereignty for the Māori people, Te Hiku Media is developing <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/essential-guide-to-automatic-speech-recognition-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automatic speech recognition</a> (ASR) models for te reo, which is a Polynesian language.</p>
<p>Built using the open-source <a href="https://nvidia.github.io/NeMo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA NeMo toolkit</a> for ASR and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, the speech-to-text models transcribe te reo with 92% accuracy. It can also transcribe bilingual speech using English and te reo with 82% accuracy. They’re pivotal tools, made by and for the Māori people, that are helping preserve and amplify their stories.</p>
<p>“There’s immense value in using NVIDIA’s open-source technologies to build the tools we need to ultimately achieve our mission, which is the preservation, promotion and revitalization of te reo Māori,” said Keoni Mahelona, chief technology officer at Te Hiku Media, who leads a team of data scientists and developers, as well as Māori language experts and data curators, working on the project.</p>
<p>“We’re also helping guide the industry on ethical ways of using data and technologies to ensure they’re used for the empowerment of marginalized communities,” added Mahelona, a Native Hawaiian now living in New Zealand.</p>
<h2><b>Building a ‘House of Speech’</b></h2>
<p>Te Hiku Media began more than three decades ago as a radio station aiming to ensure te reo had space on the airwaves. Over the years, the organization incorporated television broadcasting and, with the rise of the internet, it convened a meeting in 2013 with the community’s elders to form a strategy for sharing content in the digital era.</p>
<p>“The elders agreed that we should make the stories accessible online for our community members — rather than just keeping our archives on cassettes in boxes — but once we had that objective, the challenge was how to do this correctly, in alignment with our strong roots in valuing sovereignty,” Mahelona said.</p>
<p>Instead of uploading its video and audio sources to popular, global platforms — which, in their terms and conditions of use, require signing over certain rights related to the content — Te Hiku Media decided to build its own content distribution platform.</p>
<p>Called Whare Kōrero — meaning “house of speech” — the platform now holds more than 30 years’ worth of digitized, archival material featuring about 1,000 hours of te reo native speakers, some of whom were born in the late 19th century, as well as more recent content from second-language learners and bilingual Māori people.</p>
<p>Now, around 20 Māori radio stations use and upload their content to Whare Kōrero. Community members can access the content through an app.</p>
<p>“It’s an invaluable resource of acoustic data,” Mahelona said.</p>
<h2><b>Turning to Trustworthy AI</b></h2>
<p>Such a trove held incredible value for those working to revitalize the language, the Te Hiku Media team quickly realized, but manual transcription required pulling lots of time and effort from limited resources. So began the organization’s trustworthy AI efforts, in 2016, to accelerate its work using ASR.</p>
<p>“No one would have a clue that there are eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs in our derelict, rundown, musky-smelling building in the far north of New Zealand — training and building Māori language models,” Mahelona said. “But the work has been game-changing for us.”</p>
<p>To collect speech data in a transparent, ethically compliant, community-oriented way, Te Hiku Media began by explaining its cause to elders, garnering their support and asking them to come to the station to read phrases aloud.</p>
<p>“It was really important that we had the support of the elders and that we recorded their voices, because that’s the sort of content we want to transcribe,” Mahelona said. “But eventually these efforts didn’t scale — we needed second-language learners, kids, middle-aged people and a lot more speech data in general.”</p>
<p>So, the organization ran a crowdsourcing campaign, <a href="https://koreromaori.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kōrero Māori</a>, to collect highly labeled speech samples according to the Kaitiakitanga license, which ensures Te Hiku Media uses the data only for the benefit of the Māori people.</p>
<p>In just 10 days, more than 2,500 signed up to read 200,000+ phrases, providing over 300 hours of labeled speech data, which was used to build and train the te reo Māori ASR models.</p>
<p>In addition to other open-source trustworthy AI tools, Te Hiku Media now uses the NVIDIA NeMo toolkit’s ASR module for speech AI throughout its entire pipeline. The NeMo toolkit comprises building blocks called neural modules and includes <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-pretrained-ai-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretrained models</a> for language model development.</p>
<p>“It’s been absolutely amazing — NVIDIA’s open-source NeMo enabled our ASR models to be bilingual and added automatic punctuation to our transcriptions,” Mahelona said.</p>
<p>Te Hiku Media’s ASR models are the engines running behind Kaituhi, a te reo Māori transcription service now <a href="https://kaituhi.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available online</a>.</p>
<p>The efforts have spurred similar ASR projects now underway by Native Hawaiians and the Mohawk people in southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>“It’s indigenous-led work in trustworthy AI that’s inspiring other indigenous groups to think: ‘If they can do it, we can do it, too,’” Mahelona said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Curiosity leads the way for this week’s featured In the NVIDIA Studio 3D artist, Brellias.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of our weekly </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/in-the-nvidia-studio/"><i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/"><i>NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> technology improves creative workflows. We’re also deep diving on new </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/"><i>GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU</i></a><i> features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.</i></p>
<p>Curiosity leads the way for this week’s featured <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i> 3D artist, Brellias.</p>
<p>It’s what inspired the native Chilean’s latest artwork<i> Estrellitas</i>, which in English translates to “little stars.” The scene expresses the mixture of emotions that comes with curiosity, depicting a young girl holding little stars in her hand with a conflicted expression.</p>
<p>“She’s excited to learn about them, but she’s also a little scared,” Brellias explained.</p>
<p>The striking visual piece, rich with vibrant colors and expertly executed textures, underscores that while curiosity can invoke various emotions — both joyful and painful — it is always a source of change and growth.</p>
<h2><b>A Sky Full of Stars</b></h2>
<p>To start, Brellias first visualized and reworked an existing 3D scene of a woman in Blender. He used Blender’s built-in multi-resolution modifier for sculpting and added some shape keys to achieve the desired modifications.</p>
<p>He also created a custom shader for the character’s skin — a stylistic choice to lend its appearance a galactic hue.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69293" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69293" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w-672x441.png" alt="" width="672" height="441" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w-672x441.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w-400x263.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w-768x504.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w-686x450.png 686w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w-328x215.png 328w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w-152x100.png 152w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-collage-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69293" class="wp-caption-text">Brellias is an especially big fan of purple, blue and maroon hues.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, Brellias tapped Blender’s OptiX GPU-accelerated viewport denoising, powered by his GeForce RTX GPU.</p>
<p>“The technology helps reduce noise and improve the quality of the viewport image more quickly, allowing me to make decisions and iterate on the render faster,” he said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69296" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69296" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69296" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image4-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69296" class="wp-caption-text">Out-of-this-world levels of detail.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, Brellias animated the scene using a base model from Daz Studio, a free media design software developed by Daz 3D. Daz features an AI denoiser for high-performance interactive rendering that can also be accelerated by RTX GPUs.</p>
<p>In addition, rig tools in Blender made the animation process easy, eliminating the need to modify file formats.</p>
<p>To animate the character’s face, Brellias tied drivers to shape keys using empties, enabling greater fluidity and control over facial expressions.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69302" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69302" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69302" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-brellias-wk92-image2-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69302" class="wp-caption-text">Geometry nodes bring “Estrellitas” to life.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Brellias then used geometry nodes in Blender to animate the character’s hair, giving it a magical floating effect. To light the scene, Brellias added some ambient light behind the character’s face and between its hands. His RTX GPU accelerated OptiX ray tracing in Blender’s Cycles for the fastest final-frame renders.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-69286-3" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/breathe.mp4?_=3" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/breathe.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/breathe.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, he moved to Blackmagic Design’s DaVinci Resolve to denoise and deflicker the scene for the smoothest-looking animation.</p>
<p>Here, Brellias’ RTX GPU accelerated the color grading, video editing and color scoping processes, dramatically speeding his creative workflow. Other RTX-accelerated AI features, including facial recognition for automatically tagging clips and the tracking of effects, were available for his use.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-69286-4" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/estrellitas.mp4?_=4" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/estrellitas.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/estrellitas.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Estrellitas</i> was partially inspired by Brellias’ own curiosity in exploring NVIDIA and GeForce RTX GPU technologies to power content creation workflows — a venture that provided rewarding results.</p>
<p>“Every step of my creative process involves GPU acceleration or AI in some way or another,” said Brellias. “I can’t imagine creating without a powerful GPU at my disposal.”</p>
<p>His curiosity in AI extends to productivity. He recently installed the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/">NVIDIA Broadcast</a> app, which can transform any room into a home studio.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA Broadcast 1.4 Update Featuring Eye Contact" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nR-vP_7XFHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The app has enhanced Brellias’ microphone performance by canceling external noise and echo — especially useful given his urban surroundings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>“This year, every industry will become a technology industry,” NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang told attendees Wednesday during the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.</p>
<p>“You can now recognize and learn the language of almost anything with structure, and you can translate it to anything with structure — so text-protein, protein-text,” Huang said in a fireside chat with Martin Chavez, partner and vice chairman of global investment firm Sixth Street Partners and board chair of Recursion, a biopharmaceutical company. “This is the generative AI revolution.”</p>
<p>The conversation, which took place at the historic San Francisco Mint, followed a <a href="https://investor.nvidia.com/events-and-presentations/events-and-presentations/event-details/2024/JP-Morgan-Healthcare-Conference-2024-KwxXOv7uMk/default.aspx">presentation at the J.P. Morgan conference</a> Monday by Kimberly Powell, NVIDIA’s VP of healthcare. In her talk, Powell announced that <a href="https://www.recursion.com/news/nothing-short-of-phenomenal-new-deep-learning-model-available-on-nvidias-bionemo-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recursion is the first hosting partner</a> to offer a foundation model through the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a> cloud service, which is <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/drug-discovery-bionemo-generative-ai/">advancing into beta</a> this month.</p>
<p>She also said that Amgen, one of the first companies to employ BioNeMo, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/genomics-ai-amgen-superpod/">plans to advance drug discovery with generative AI</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD</a> — and that BioNeMo is used by a growing number of techbio companies, pharmas, AI software vendors and systems integrators. Among them are <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deloitte-expands-quartz-ai-suite-with-atlas-ai-for-drug-discovery-302028784.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deloitte</a>, <a href="https://innophore.com/innophore-is-folding-the-human-proteome-using-nvidia-bionemo-creating-a-fused-dataset-of-structural-models-for-machine-learning-purposes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Innophore</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/insilico-medicine-ai-revolution-drug-discovery-in-silico-medicine-zlwfe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insilico Medicine</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/transforming-molecular-design-oneangstrom-integrates-nvidia-redon-eukpe%3FtrackingId=GwLwkk17I2oVvvfSB2KuPQ%253D%253D/?trackingId=GwLwkk17I2oVvvfSB2KuPQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OneAngstrom</a>, Recursion and <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-cloud/terray-therapeutics-customer-success-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terray Therapeutics</a>.</p>
<h2><b>From Computer-Aided Chip Design to Drug Design</b></h2>
<p>Healthcare customers and partners now consume well over a billion dollars in NVIDIA GPU computing each year — directly and indirectly through cloud partners.</p>
<p>Huang traced NVIDIA’s involvement in accelerated healthcare back to two research projects that caught his attention around 15 years ago: one at Mass General tapped <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17881799/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA GPUs to reconstruct CT images</a>, another at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/es-la/data-center/gpu-accelerated-applications/namd/">applied GPU acceleration to molecular dynamics</a>.</p>
<p>“It opened my mind that we could apply the same methodology that we use in computer-aided chip design to help the world of drug discovery go from computer-aided drug discovery to computer-aided drug design,” he said, realizing that, “if we scale this up by a billion times, we could simulate biology.”</p>
<p>After 40 years of advancements in computer-aided chip design, engineers can now build complex computing systems entirely in simulation, Huang explained. Over the next decade, the same could be true for AI-accelerated drug design.</p>
<p>“Almost everything will largely start in silico, largely end in silico,” he said, using a term that refers to an experiment run on a computer.</p>
<h2><b>Collaborating on the Future of Drug Discovery and Medical Instruments</b></h2>
<p>With the progress made to date, computer-aided drug discovery is “genuinely miraculous,” Huang said.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is propelling the field forward by building state-of-the-art AI models and powerful computing platforms, and by collaborating with domain experts and investing in techbio companies.</p>
<p>“We are determined to work with you to advance this field,” Huang said, inviting healthcare innovators to reach out to NVIDIA. “We deeply believe that this is going to be the future of the way that drugs will be discovered and designed.”</p>
<p>The company’s pipelines for accelerated healthcare include algorithms for cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, gene sequencing, amino acid structure prediction and virtual drug molecule screening. And as AI advances, these computing tools are becoming much easier to access, Huang said.</p>
<p>“Because of artificial intelligence and the groundbreaking work that our industry has done, we have closed the technology divide in a dramatic way,” he said. “Everybody is a programmer, and the programming language of the future is called ‘human.’”</p>
<p>Beyond drug development, this transformation to a software-defined, AI-driven industry will also advance medical instruments.</p>
<p>“A medical instrument is never going to be the same again. Ultrasound systems, CT scan systems, all kinds of instruments — they’re always going to be a device plus a whole bunch of AIs,” Huang said. “The value that will create, the opportunities you create, are going to be incredible.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The financial services industry is undergoing a significant transformation with the adoption of AI technologies. NVIDIA’s fourth annual <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/finance/ai-financial-services-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of AI in Financial Services Report</a> provides insights into the current landscape and emerging trends for 2024.</p>
<p>The report reveals that an overwhelming 91% of financial services companies are either assessing AI or already using it in production. These firms are using AI to drive innovation, improve operational efficiency and enhance customer experiences.</p>
<p>Portfolio optimization, fraud detection and risk management remain top AI use cases, while <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> is quickly gaining popularity with organizations keen to uncover new efficiencies.</p>
<p>Below are the report’s key findings, which show how the financial services industry is evolving as advanced AI becomes more accessible.</p>
<h2><strong>Generative AI and Large Language Models Are on the Rise</strong></h2>
<p>Reflecting a macro-trend seen across industries, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language models</a> (LLMs) and generative AI have emerged as significant areas of interest for financial services companies. Fifty-five percent of survey respondents reported that they were actively seeking generative AI workflows for their companies.</p>
<p>Organizations are exploring generative AI and LLMs for an array of applications ranging from marketing and sales — ad copy, email copy and content production — to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">synthetic data generation</a>. Of these use cases, 37% of respondents showed interest in report generation, synthesis and investment research to cut down on repetitive manual work.</p>
<p>Customer experience and engagement was another sought-out use case, with a 34% response rate. This suggests that financial services institutions are exploring chatbots, virtual assistants and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/whats-a-recommender-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommendation systems</a> to enhance the customer experience.</p>
<h2><strong>AI Is Having an Impact Across Departments and Disciplines</strong></h2>
<p>With 75% of survey respondents considering their organization’s AI capabilities to be industry leading or middle of the pack, financial services organizations are becoming more confident in their ability to build, deploy and extract value from AI implementations.</p>
<p>The most popular uses for AI were in operations, risk and compliance, and marketing. To improve operational efficiency, financial organizations are using AI to automate manual processes, enhance data analysis and inform investment decisions.</p>
<p>To enhance risk and compliance, they’re deploying AI to analyze vast amounts of data to identify suspicious activities and anomalous transaction patterns. They’re also using AI to analyze customer data to predict preferences and deliver personalized marketing campaigns, educational content and targeted promotions.</p>
<p>Companies are already seeing results. Forty-three percent of financial services professionals indicated that AI had improved their operational efficiency, while 42% felt it had helped their business build a competitive advantage.</p>
<h2><strong>A Shift in the Headwinds</strong></h2>
<p>In previous years, the number one challenge respondents reported was recruiting AI experts and data scientists. A 30% increase this year in survey participants resoundingly responded that data-related challenges were the primary concern. This includes data privacy challenges, data sovereignty and data scattered around the globe governed by different oversight regulations.</p>
<p>The growing attention to these issues reflects the advancing power and complexity of AI models, which require huge, diverse datasets to train, as well as increasing regulatory scrutiny and emphasis on responsible AI.</p>
<p>Recruiting and retaining AI experts remains a challenge, as do budget concerns. But more than 60% of respondents are still planning to increase investment in computing infrastructure or optimizing AI workflows, underscoring the importance of these tools in quickly building and deploying trustworthy AI to overcome these barriers.</p>
<h2><strong>Paving the Way for Future Investments</strong></h2>
<p>By and large, the survey results paint a positive picture of AI bringing greater efficiency to operations, personalization to customer engagements, and precision to investment decisions.</p>
<p>Finance professionals agree. Eighty-six percent of respondents reported a positive impact on revenue, while 82% noted a reduction in costs. Fifty-one percent strongly agreed that AI would be important to their company’s future success, a 76% increase from last year.</p>
<p>With this positive outlook, 97% of companies plan to invest more in AI technologies in the near future. Focus areas for future investments include identifying additional AI use cases, optimizing AI workflows and increasing infrastructure spending.</p>
<p>To build and scale impactful AI across the enterprise, financial services organizations need a comprehensive AI platform that empowers data scientists, quants and developers to seamlessly collaborate while minimizing obstacles. To that end, executives are investing more in AI infrastructure and prioritizing high-yield AI use cases to improve employee productivity while delivering superior customer experiences and investment results.</p>
