										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Harnessing optimized AI models for healthcare is easier than ever as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a>, a collection of cloud-native microservices, integrates with Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p><a href="http://ai.nvidia.com/">NIM</a>, part of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform available on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ozgjkov6vq3l6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS Marketplace</a>, enables developers to access a growing library of AI models through industry-standard application programming interfaces, or APIs. The library includes <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/">foundation models</a> for drug discovery, medical imaging and genomics, backed by enterprise-grade security and support.</p>
<p>NIM is now available via Amazon SageMaker — a fully managed service to prepare data and build, train and deploy machine learning models — and AWS ParallelCluster, an open-source tool to deploy and manage high performance computing clusters on AWS. NIMs can also be orchestrated using AWS HealthOmics, a purpose-built service for biological data analysis.</p>
<p>Easy access to NIM will enable the thousands of healthcare and life sciences companies already using AWS to deploy <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> more quickly, without the complexities of model development and packaging for production. It’ll also help developers build workflows that combine AI models across different modalities, such as amino acid sequences, MRI images and plain-text patient health records.</p>
<p>Presented today at the <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/NAMER-event-T3-AWS-Life-Science-Symposium-2024-reg-event.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS Life Sciences Leader Symposium</a> in Boston, this initiative extends the availability of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/">NVIDIA Clara</a> accelerated healthcare software and services on AWS — which include fast and easy-to-deploy NIMs from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a> for drug discovery, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/monai/">NVIDIA MONAI</a> for medical imaging workflows and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/genomics/">NVIDIA Parabricks</a> for accelerated genomics.</p>
<h2><b>Pharma and Biotech Companies Adopt NVIDIA AI on AWS</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/bionemo/">BioNeMo</a> is a generative AI platform of foundation models, training frameworks, domain-specific data loaders and optimized training recipes​ that support the training and fine-tuning of biology and chemistry models on proprietary data.​ It’s used by more than 100 organizations globally.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/genomics-ai-amgen-superpod/">Amgen</a>, one of the world’s leading biotechnology companies, has used the BioNeMo framework to train generative models for protein design, and is exploring the potential use of BioNeMo with AWS.</p>
<p><i>​</i>BioNeMo models for protein structure prediction, generative chemistry and molecular docking prediction are available as NIM microservices, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-pretrained-ai-model/">pretrained</a> and optimized to run on any NVIDIA GPU or cluster of GPUs. These models can be combined to support a holistic, AI-accelerated drug discovery workflow.</p>
<p>Biotechnology company A-Alpha Bio harnesses synthetic biology and AI to measure, predict and engineer protein-to-protein interactions. When its researchers moved from a generic version of the ESM-2 protein language model to <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/bionemo-framework/latest/models/esm2-nv.html">a version optimized by NVIDIA</a> running on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> on AWS, they immediately saw a speedup of more than 10x. This lets the team sample a much more extensive field of protein candidates than they would have otherwise.</p>
<p>For organizations that want to augment these models with their own experimental data, NIM enables developers to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">enhance a model with retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG</a> — known as a lab-in-the-loop design.</p>
<h2><b>Parabricks Enables Accelerated Genomics Pipelines</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA NIM includes genomics models from NVIDIA Parabricks, which are also <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/easily-run-nvidia-parabricks-ready2run-workflows-on-amazon-omics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on AWS HealthOmics</a> as Ready2Run workflows that enable customers to deploy pre-built pipelines.</p>
<p>Life sciences company Agilent used Parabricks genomics analysis tools running on NVIDIA GPU-powered <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances</a> to significantly improve processing speeds for variant calling workflows on the company’s cloud-native <a href="https://www.agilent.com/en/product/next-generation-sequencing/clinical-informatics-platform/alissa-reporter-1947792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alissa Reporter</a> software. Integrating Parabricks with Alissa secondary analysis pipelines enables researchers to access rapid data analysis in a secure cloud environment.​</p>
<h2><b>Conversational AI Technology Supports Digital Health</b></h2>
<p>In addition to models that can decode proteins and genomic sequences, NIM microservices offer optimized <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language models</a> for conversational AI and visual generative AI models for avatars and digital humans.</p>
<p>AI-powered digital assistants can enhance healthcare by answering patient questions and supporting clinicians with logistics. Trained on healthcare organization-specific data using RAG, they could connect to relevant internal data sources to synthesize research, surface insights and improve productivity.</p>
<p>Generative AI startup <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/03/18/2848236/0/en/Hippocratic-AI-Announces-Collaboration-with-NVIDIA-to-Develop-Super-Low-Latency-Empathy-Inference-for-One-of-the-World-s-First-Generative-AI-Powered-Healthcare-Agents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hippocratic AI</a> is in the final stages of testing AI-powered healthcare agents that focus on a wide range of tasks including wellness coaching, preoperative outreach and post-discharge follow-up.</p>
<p>The company, which uses NVIDIA GPUs through AWS, is adopting NVIDIA NIM and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a> microservices to power a generative AI agent for digital health.</p>

<p>Riot Games has rolled out the <i>League of Legends</i> 14.9 update globally, which adds the Vanguard security software to the game. Since Vanguard doesn’t support virtual machines like GeForce NOW, the game is under maintenance and no longer playable on the cloud gaming platform for the foreseeable future. Work is underway to find a solution for GeForce NOW members.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>YouTube robotics influencer Dave Niewinski has developed robots for everything from driveable La-Z-Boy chairs to an AI-guided cornhole tosser and horse-drawn chariot racing.</p>
<p>His recent <a href="https://www.hackster.io/davesarmoury/interactive-animatronic-glados-8b4238">Interactive Animatronic GLaDOS</a> project was among nine winners in the <a href="https://www.hackster.io/contests/SparkFun-NVIDIA-AI-Innovation-Challenge">Hackster AI Innovation Challenge</a>. About 100 contestants vied for prizes from NVIDIA and Sparkfun by creating open-source projects to advance the use of AI in edge computing, robotics and IoT.</p>
<p>Niewinski won first place in the generative AI applications category for his innovative robot based on the GLaDOS guide from game series <i>Portal</i>, the first-person puzzle platform from video game developer Valve.</p>
<p>Other top winners included contestants Andrei Ciobanu and Allen Tao, who took first prize in the generative AI models for the edge and AI at the edge applications categories, respectively. Ciobanu used generative AI to help virtually try on clothes, while Tao developed a ROS-based robot to map the inside of a home to help find things.</p>
<h2><b>Harnessing LLMs for Robots</b></h2>
<p>Niewinski builds custom applications for robotics at his <a href="https://www.armourylabs.com/">Armoury Labs</a> business in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, where he uses the NVIDIA Jetson platform for edge AI and robotics, creating open-source tutorials and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavesArmoury/videos">YouTube videos</a> following his experiences.</p>
<p>He built his interactive GLaDOS robot to create a personal assistant for himself in the lab. It handles queries using Transformer-based speech recognition, text-to-speech, and large language models (LLMs) running onboard an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin</a>, which interfaces with a robot arm and camera for interactions.</p>
<p>GLaDOS can track his whereabouts in the lab, move in different directions to face him and respond quickly to queries.</p>
<p>“I like doing things with robots that people will look at and say it’s not what they had immediately expected,” he said.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Bringing GLaDOS to life with Robotics and AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNcKTZsHyfA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>He wanted the assistant to sound like the original GLaDOS from <i>Portal</i> and respond quickly. Fortunately, the gaming company Valve has put all of the voice lines from <i>Portal </i>and <i>Portal 2</i> on its website, allowing Niewinski to download the audio to help train a model.</p>
<p>“Using Jetson, your average question-and-answer stuff runs pretty quick for speech,” he said.</p>
<p>Niewinski used NVIDIA’s open-source <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo">NeMo</a> toolkit to fine-tune a voice for GLaDOS, training a spectrogram generator network called <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/tts_en_fastpitch">FastPitch</a> and <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/tts_hifigan">HiFiGAN</a> vocoder network to refine the audio quality.</p>
<p>Both networks are deployed on Orin with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/riva/">NVIDIA Riva</a> to enable speech recognition and synthesis that’s been optimized to run at many times the real-time rate of speech, so that it can run alongside the LLM while maintaining a smooth, interactive delivery.</p>
<p>For generating realistic responses from GLaDOS, Niewinski uses a locally hosted LLM called OpenChat that he runs in Docker from <a href="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers">jetson-containers</a>, saying that it was a drop-in replacement for OpenAI’s API. All of this AI is running on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">Jetson</a> module, using the latest open-source ML software stack built with CUDA and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack">JetPack</a>.</p>
<p>To enable GLaDOS to move, Niewinski developed the interactions for a Unitree Z1 robotic arm. It has a stereo camera and models for seeing and tracking a human speaking and a 3D-printed GLaDOS head and body shell around the arm.</p>
<h2><b>Trying on Generative AI for Fashion Fit</b></h2>
<p>Winner Ciobanu, based in Romania, aimed to improve the virtual clothing try-on experience with the help of generative AI, taking a top prize for his <a href="https://www.hackster.io/andrei-ciobanu2/edgestyle-fashion-preview-at-the-edge-b6d845">EdgeStyle: Fashion Preview at the Edge</a>.</p>
<p>He used AI models such as YOLOv5, SAM and OpenPose to extract and refine data from images and videos. Then he used Stable Diffusion to generate the images, which he said was key to achieving accurate virtual try-ons.</p>
<p>This system taught the model how clothes fit different poses on people, which he said enhanced the realism of the try-ons.</p>
<p>“It’s quite handy as it allows users to see how clothes would look on them without actually trying them on,” said Ciobanu.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="EdgeStyle Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kR_o9eEUHK4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The NVIDIA JetPack SDK provided all the tools needed to run AI models smoothly on the Jetson Orin, he said.</p>
<p>“It’s super-helpful to have a stable set of tools, especially when you’re dealing with AI tech that keeps changing,” said Ciobanu. “It really cut down on the time and hassle for us developers, letting us focus more on the cool stuff we’re building instead of getting stuck on tech issues.”</p>
<h2> <b>Finding Lost Items With Robot Assistance</b></h2>
<p>Winner Tao, based in Ontario, Canada, created a robot to lessen the burden of searching for things lost around the house. His <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hackster.io%2Fceyeber%2Fan-eye-for-an-item-9162a7&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cscmartin%40nvidia.com%7C0e398a0434c949e581b508dc65b1f664%7C43083d15727340c1b7db39efd9ccc17a%7C0%7C0%7C638497062235862516%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=FiIs8uLHjF8szFOvOs5F1vHFD3ax0fKBEnLyL3kS9aQ%3D&amp;reserved=0">An Eye for an Item</a> project took top honors at the Hackster challenge.</p>
<p>“Finding lost objects is a chore, and recent developments in zero-shot object detection and LLMs make it feasible for a computer to detect arbitrary objects for us based on textual or pictorial descriptions, presenting an opportunity for automation,” said Tao.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Teleop Drive Test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dx87BFX5nA8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Tao said he needed robot computing capabilities to catalog objects in any unstructured environment — whether a living room or large warehouse. And he needed it to also perform real-time calculations for localization to help with navigation, as well as running inference on larger object detection models.</p>
<p>“Jetson Orin was a perfect fit, supporting all functionality from text and image queries into <a href="https://www.jetson-ai-lab.com/tutorial_nanodb.html">NanoDB</a>, to real-time odometry feedback, including leveraging <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/ros">Isaac ROS</a>’ hardware-accelerated AprilTag detections for drift correction,” he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Chatbots powered by large-language AI models have transformed computing, and NVIDIA ChatRTX lets users interact with their local data, accelerated by NVIDIA RTX-powered Windows PCs and workstations. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>AI Decoded series</i></a><i>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and which showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.</i></p>
<p>Chatbots powered by large-language AI models have transformed computing, and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chatrtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA ChatRTX</a> lets users interact with their local data, accelerated by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX</a>-powered Windows PCs and workstations. A <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chatrtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new update</a>, first demoed at <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-decoded-gtc-chatrtx-workbench-nim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTC</a> in March, expands the power of this RTX-accelerated chatbot app with additional features and support for new models.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA RTX Remix beta update brings NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-decoded-ray-reconstruction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ray Reconstruction</a> to the modding platform for even more impressive real-time ray tracing.</p>
<h2><b>Say It Out Loud</b></h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="ChatRTX Update: New Models &amp; Features | Voice &amp; Image Data Support" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zMROAxJQ7rk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>ChatRTX uses <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM software and NVIDIA RTX acceleration to bring chatbot capabilities to RTX-powered Windows PCs and workstations. Backed by its powerful large language models (LLMs), users can query their notes and documents with ChatRTX, which can quickly generate relevant responses, while running locally on the user’s device.</p>
<p>The latest version adds support for additional LLMs, including Gemma, the latest open, local LLM trained by Google. Gemma was developed from the same research and technology used to create the company’s Gemini models and is built for responsible AI development. ChatRTX also now supports ChatGLM3, an open, bilingual (English and Chinese) LLM based on the general language model framework.</p>
<p>Users can also interact with image data thanks to support for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training from OpenAI. CLIP is a neural network that, through training and refinement, learns visual concepts from natural language supervision — that is, the model recognizes what it’s “seeing” in image collections. With CLIP support in ChatRTX, users can interact with photos and images on their local devices through words, terms and phrases, without the need for complex metadata labeling.</p>
<p>The new ChatRTX release also lets people chat with their data using their voice. Thanks to support for Whisper, an automatic speech recognition system that uses AI to process spoken language, users can send voice queries to the application and ChatRTX will provide text responses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chatrtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download</a> ChatRTX today.</p>
<h2><b>Mix It Up</b></h2>
<p>With RTX Remix, modders can transform classic PC games into RTX remasters using AI-accelerated tools on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platform.</p>
<p>Now, they can use <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction</a> in their projects with just a few clicks, thanks to an update to RTX Remix available this week. Its advanced, AI-powered neural renderer improves the fidelity, responsiveness and quality of ray-traced effects, giving <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA GeForce RTX</a> gamers an even better experience.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Portal with RTX | DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction Comparison - Fence Scene" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kXNzDQTSFF8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>AI powers other elements of the Remix workflow, too. Modders can use generative AI texture tools to analyze low-resolution textures from classic games, generate physically accurate materials — including normal and roughness maps — and upscale the resolution by up to 4x. Tools like this also save modders time, quickly handling a task that could otherwise become tedious.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Talk about commitment. When startup SEA.AI, an NVIDIA Metropolis partner, set out to create a system that would use AI to scan the seas to enhance maritime safety, entrepreneur Raphael Biancale wasn’t afraid to take the plunge. He donned a lifejacket and jumped into the ocean.</p>
<p>It’s a move that demonstrates Biancale’s commitment and pioneering approach. The startup, founded in 2018 and based in Linz, Austria, with subsidiaries in France, Portugal and the US, had to build its first-of-its-kind training data from scratch in order to train an AI to help oceangoers of all kinds scan the seas.</p>
<p>And to do that, the company needed photos of what a person in the water looked like. That’s when Biancale, now the company’s head of research, walked the plank.</p>
<p>The company has come a long way since then, with a full product line powered by NVIDIA AI technology that lets commercial and recreational sailors detect objects on the seas, whether potential hazards or people needing rescue.</p>
<p>It’s an effort inspired by Biancale’s experience on a night sail. The lack of visibility and situational awareness illuminated the pressing need for advanced safety technologies in the maritime world that AI is bringing to the automotive industry.</p>
<p>AI, of course, is finding its way into all things aquatic. Startup <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/saildrone-autonomous-oceanic-monitoring-jetson-deepstream/">Saildrone’s autonomous sailing vessels</a> can help conduct data-gathering for science, fisheries, weather forecasting, ocean mapping and maritime security. Other researchers are using AI to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/project-ceti/">interpret whale songs</a> and even protect beachgoers from <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rip/">dangerous rip currents</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-71251 size-full" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEA-ABOVE.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="433" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEA-ABOVE.jpg 624w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEA-ABOVE-400x278.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEA-ABOVE-310x215.jpg 310w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEA-ABOVE-144x100.jpg 144w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>SEA.AI, however, promises to make the seas safer for everyone who steps aboard a boat. First introduced for ocean racing sailboats, SEA.AI’s system has quickly evolved into an AI-powered situational awareness system that can be deployed on everything from recreational sail and powerboats to commercial shipping vessels.</p>
<p>SEA.AI directly addresses one of the most significant risks for all these vessels: collisions. Thanks to SEA.AI, commercial and recreational oceangoers worldwide can travel with more confidence.</p>
<h2>How SEA.AI Works</h2>
<p>At the heart of SEA.AI’s approach is a proprietary database of over 9 million annotated marine objects which is growing constantly.</p>
<p>When combined with high-tech optical sensors and the latest AI technology from NVIDIA, SEA.AI’s systems can recognize and classify objects in real-time, significantly improving maritime safety.</p>
<p>SEA.AI technology can detect a person in water up to 700 meters — almost half a mile — away, a dinghy up to 3,000 meters, and motorboats up to 7,500 meters.</p>
<p>This capability ensures maritime operators can identify hazards before they pose a threat. It complements older marine safety systems that rely on radar and satellite signals.</p>
<p>SEA.AI solutions integrate with central marine display units from industry-leading manufacturers like Raymarine, B&amp;G, Garmin and Furuno as well as Android and iOS-based mobile devices. This provides broad applicability across the maritime sector, from recreational vessels to commercial and government ships.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a> edge AI platform is integral to SEA.AI’s success. The platform for robotics and embedded computing applications enables SEA.AI products to achieve unparalleled processing power and efficiency, setting a new standard in maritime safety by quickly detecting, analyzing and alerting operators to objects.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-71255 size-full" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEAAI-GEAR.png" alt="" width="624" height="284" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEAAI-GEAR.png 624w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEAAI-GEAR-400x182.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEAAI-GEAR-406x185.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEAAI-GEAR-188x86.png 188w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<h2>AI Integration and Real-Time Object Detection</h2>
<p>SEA.AI uses NVIDIA’s AI and machine vision technology to offer real-time object detection and classification, providing maritime operators with immediate identification of potential hazards.</p>
<p>SEA.AI is bringing its approach to oceangoers of all kinds with three product lines.</p>
<p>One, SEA.AI Sentry, provides 360-degree situational awareness for commercial vessels and motor yachts with features like collision avoidance, object tracking and perimeter surveillance.</p>
<p>Another, SEA.AI Offshore,  provides bluewater sailors with high-tech safety and convenience with simplified installation across several editions that can suit different detection and technical needs.</p>
<p>The third, SEA.AI Competition, offers reliable object detection for ocean racing and performance yacht sailors. Its ultra-lightweight design ensures maximum performance when navigating at high speeds.</p>
<p>With a growing team of more than 60 and a distribution network spanning over 40 countries, SEA.AI is charting a course to help ensure every journey on the waves is safer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[OpenUSD integration into Siemens technologies powers a new wave of industrial digitalization.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/news/"><i>Into the Omniverse</i></a><i>, a series focused on how artists, developers and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advances in </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>OpenUSD</i></a><i> and </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>NVIDIA Omniverse</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description</a>, aka OpenUSD, is elevating the manufacturing game. Siemens, a leader in industrial technology, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/industrial-sector/siemens/">has embraced OpenUSD</a> as a cornerstone of its digital transformation journey, using it to help bridge the gap between physical and virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Siemens is adding support for <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/siemens-immersive-visualization-generative-ai/">OpenUSD in its Siemens Xcelerator</a> platform applications, starting with <a href="https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/teamcenter/teamcenter-x-cloud-plm/"><span>Teamcenter X software</span></a>.</p>
<p>The integration empowers manufacturers to create photorealistic, robust <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-twin/">digital twins</a> that mirror real-world counterparts with unprecedented fidelity and efficiency. This allows for optimized resource utilization, minimized waste and enhanced product quality through comprehensive simulation and analysis — all of which align with sustainability and quality objectives.</p>
<p>For a company such as Siemens — one whose software touches all parts of the manufacturing cycle — digitalization can <span>mean helping customers save time and costs</span>, streamline workflows and reduce risk of manufacturing defects.</p>
<p>Ian Fisher, a member of <a href="https://www.sw.siemens.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siemens Digital Industries Software</a> team, is no stranger to the impact of embracing digital transformation — especially one powered by OpenUSD and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20enables%20users%20to,on%20a%20variety%20of%20inputs.">generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>“We are an industrial company where data is king,” he said. “OpenUSD comes in from the media side of the world, and we are looking to bring its openness and flexibility into the industrial world.”</p>
<p>Enterprises of all sizes depend on Siemens’ Teamcenter software, part of the Siemens Xcelerator platform, to develop and deliver products at scale. By connecting <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> — a platform of APIs and services based on OpenUSD — with Teamcenter X, Siemens’ cloud-based product lifecycle management software, engineering teams can make their physics-based digital twins more photorealistic and immersive, improving accuracy and minimizing waste and errors within workflows.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-71329 aligncenter" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ss060_comp_v01-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif" alt="" width="600" height="360" /></p>
<p>Siemens’ adoption of OpenUSD means that companies like <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/siemens-immersive-visualization-generative-ai/">HD Hyundai</a>, a leader in sustainable ship manufacturing, can consolidate and visualize complex engineering projects directly within Teamcenter X. Find out more in the demo:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Siemens Teamcenter X Powered by NVIDIA Omniverse APIs" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrb2tPHiLRo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>OpenUSD is touching other parts of Siemens as well. Siemens produces inverters, drive controllers and motors for more than 30,000 customers worldwide. Its lead electronics plant, <a href="https://assets.new.siemens.com/siemens/assets/api/uuid:50b2232d-7c93-4684-99af-2d532a52de9b/4681-SIE-BRO-GWE-Fly-A4-One-Pager-3_original.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GWE</a>, in Erlangen, Germany, has been developing use cases from AI-enabled computer vision for <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/siemens-omniverse-replicator-aws-synthetic-data-generation/">defect detection</a> to training pick-and-place robots.</p>
<p>One of their main challenges has been acquiring data to train the AI models that fuel these use cases. By building custom<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/"> synthetic data generation</a> pipelines using Omniverse Replicator, powered by OpenUSD, the engineers were able to generate large sets of diverse training data by varying many parameters including color, texture, background, lighting and more — allowing them to not only bootstrap but also quickly iterate on their AI models.</p>
<p>Committed to a future of widespread OpenUSD integration, Siemens was one of <a href="https://aousd.org/news/alliance-for-openusd-introduces-new-working-groups-and-liaison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight new general members</a> that joined the <a href="https://aousd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alliance for OpenUSD (AOUSD)</a> last month, an organization dedicated to interoperability of 3D content through standardization.</p>
<p>Watch Fisher and other special guests discuss the impact of OpenUSD on industrial digitization workflows in this livestream replay:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>To address the shift to electric vehicles, increased semiconductor demand, manufacturing onshoring, and ambitions for greater sustainability, manufacturers are investing in new factory developments and re-engineering their existing facilities.</p>
<p>These projects often run over budget and schedule, due to complex and manual planning processes, legacy technology infrastructure, and disconnected tools, data and teams.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, manufacturers are embracing digitalization and virtual factories, powered by technologies like <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-twin/">digital twins,</a> the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)</a><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-twin/"> ecosystem</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>, that enable new possibilities from planning to operations.</p>
<h2>What Is a Virtual Factory?</h2>
<p>A virtual factory is a physically accurate representation of a real factory. These digital twins of factories allow manufacturers to model, simulate, analyze and optimize their production processes, resources and operations without the need for a physical prototype or pilot plant.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Virtual Factories</h2>
<p>Virtual factories unlock many benefits and possibilities for manufacturers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Streamlined Communication: </b>Instead of teams relying on in-person meetings and static planning documents for project alignment, virtual factories streamline communication and ensure that critical design and operations decisions are informed by the most current data.</li>
<li><b>Contextualized Planning</b>: During facility design, construction and commissioning, virtual factories allow project stakeholders to visualize designs in the context of the entire facility and production process. Planning and operations teams can compare and verify built structures with the virtual designs in real time and decrease costs by identifying errors and incorporating feedback early in the review process.</li>
<li><b>Optimized Facility Designs: </b>Connecting virtual factories to simulations of processes and discrete events enables teams to optimize facility designs for production and material flow, ergonomic work design, safety and overall utilization.</li>
<li><b>Intelligent and Optimized Operations: </b>Operations teams can integrate their virtual factories with valuable production data from Internet of Things technology at the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-edge-computing/">edge</a>, and tap AI to drive further optimizations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Virtual Factories: A Testing Ground for AI and Robotics</h2>
<p>Robotics developers are increasingly using virtual factories to train and test AI and autonomous systems that run in physical factories. For example, virtual factories can enable developers and manufacturing teams to simulate digital workers and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/isaac-amr-nova-orin-autonomous-mobile-robots/">autonomous mobile robots</a> (AMRs), vision AI agents and sensors to create a centralized map of worker activity throughout a facility. By fusing data from simulated camera streams with multi-camera tracking, developers can generate occupancy maps that inform optimal AMR routes.</p>
<p>Developers can also use these physically accurate virtual factories to train and test AI agents capable of managing their robot fleets, to ensure AI-enabled robots can adapt to real-world unpredictability and to identify streamlined configurations for human-robot collaboration.</p>

<h2>What Are the Foundations of a Virtual Factory</h2>
<p>Building large-scale, physically accurate virtual factories that unlock these transformational possibilities requires bringing together many tools, data formats and technologies to harmonize the representation of real-world aspects in the digital world.</p>
<p>Originally invented by Pixar Animation Studios, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">OpenUSD</a> encompasses a collection of tools and capabilities that enable the data interoperability developers and manufacturers require to achieve their digitalization goals.</p>
<p>OpenUSD’s core superpower is flexible data modeling. 3D input can be accepted from source applications and combined with a variety of data, including from computer-aided design software, live sensors, documentation and maintenance records, through a unified data pipeline. OpenUSD enables developers to share these data types across different simulation tools and AI models, providing insights for all stakeholders. Data can be synced from the factory floor to the digital twin, surfacing real-time insights for factory managers and teams.</p>
<p>By developing virtual factory solutions on OpenUSD, developers can enhance collaboration for factory teams, allowing them to review plans, discuss optimization opportunities and make decisions in real time.</p>
<p>To support and accelerate the development of the OpenUSD ecosystem, Pixar, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk and NVIDIA formed the <a href="https://aousd.org/">Alliance for OpenUSD</a>, which is building open standards for USD in core specification, materials, geometry and more.</p>
<h2>Industrial Use Cases for Virtual Factories</h2>
<p>To unlock the potential of virtual factories, industry leaders including Autodesk, Continental, Pegatron, Rockwell Automation, Siemens and Wistron are developing virtual-factory solutions that interoperate with OpenUSD and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform of application programming interfaces (APIs) and software development kits that enable developers to build applications for complex 3D and industrial digitalization workflows based on OpenUSD.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62639/">FlexSim</a>, an Autodesk company, uses OpenUSD to enable factory teams to analyze, visualize and optimize real-world processes with its simulation modeling for complex systems and operations. The discrete-event simulation software provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to create 3D simulation models, account for real-world variability, run “what-if” scenarios and perform in-depth analyses.</p>
<p>Developers at <a href="https://www.continental.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continental</a>, a leading German automotive technology company, developed <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62919/">ContiVerse</a>, a factory planning and manufacturing operations application on OpenUSD and NVIDIA Omniverse. The application helps Continental optimize factory layouts and plan production processes collaboratively, leading to an expected 13% reduction in time to market.<a href="https://www.pegatroncorp.com/"> </a></p>
<p>Partnering with IT consulting and digital services provider <a href="https://www.softserveinc.com/en-us">SoftServe</a>, Continental also developed <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s61799/">Industrial Co-Pilot</a>, which combines AI-driven insights with immersive visualization to deliver real-time guidance and predictive analytics to engineers. This is expected to reduce maintenance effort and downtime by 10%.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pegatroncorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pegatron</a>, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of smartphones and consumer electronics, is <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62553/">developing virtual-factory solutions</a> on OpenUSD to accelerate the development of new factories — as well as to minimize change orders, optimize operations and maximize production-line throughput in existing facilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62623/">Rockwell Automation</a> is integrating NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud APIs and OpenUSD with its <a href="https://www.demo3d.com/">Emulate3D</a> digital twin software to bring manufacturing teams data interoperability, live collaboration and physically based visualization for designing, building and operating industrial-scale digital twins of production systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siemens</a>, a leading technology company for automation, digitalization and sustainability and a member of the Alliance for OpenUSD, is adopting Omniverse Cloud APIs within its Siemens Xcelerator Platform, starting with Teamcenter X, the industry-leading cloud-based product lifecycle management software. This will help teams design, build and test next-generation products, manufacturing processes and factories virtually, before they’re built in the physical world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wistron.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wistron</a>, a leading global technology service provider and electronics manufacturer, is <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62600/">digitalizing new and existing factories</a> with OpenUSD. By developing virtual-factory solutions on NVIDIA Omniverse, Wistron enables its factory teams to collaborate remotely to refine layout configurations, optimize surface mount technology and in-circuit testing lines, and transform product-on-dock testing.</p>
<p>With these solutions, Wistron has achieved a 51% boost in worker efficiency and 50% reduction in production process times. Layout optimization and real-time monitoring have decreased defect rates by 40%. And construction time on Wistron’s new <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-platform/">NVIDIA DGX</a> factory was cut in half, from about five months to just two and a half months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/"><i>AI Decoded series</i></a><i>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and which showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.</i></p>
<p>AI continues to raise the bar for PC gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction/">DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction</a> creates higher quality ray-traced images for intensive ray-traced games and apps. This advanced AI-powered neural renderer is a groundbreaking feature that elevates ray-traced image quality for all GeForce RTX GPUs, outclassing traditional hand-tuned denoisers by using an AI network trained by an NVIDIA supercomputer. The result improves lighting effects like reflections, global illumination, and shadows to create a more immersive, realistic gaming experience.</p>
<h2><b>A Ray of Light</b></h2>
<p>Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can realistically simulate the lighting of a scene and its objects by rendering physically accurate reflections, refractions, shadows and indirect lighting. Ray tracing generates computer graphics images by tracing the path of light from the view camera — which determines the view into the scene — through the 2D viewing plane, out into the 3D scene, and back to the light sources. For instance, if rays strike a mirror, reflections are generated.</p>

<p>It’s the digital equivalent to real-world objects illuminated by beams of light and the path of the light being followed from the eye of the viewer to the objects that light interacts with. That’s ray tracing.</p>
<p>Simulating light in this manner — shooting rays for every pixel on the screen — is computationally intensive, even for offline renderers that calculate scenes over the course of several minutes or hours. Instead, ray samples fire a handful of rays at various points across the scene for a representative sample of the scene’s lighting, reflectivity and shadowing.</p>
<p>However, there are limitations. The output is a noisy, speckled image with gaps, good enough to ascertain how the scene should look when ray traced. To fill in the missing pixels that weren’t ray traced, hand-tuned denoisers use two different methods, temporally accumulating pixels across multiple frames, and spatially interpolating them to blend neighboring pixels together. Through this process, the noisy raw output is converted into a ray-traced image.</p>
<p>This adds complexity and cost to the development process, and reduces the frame rate in highly ray-traced games where multiple denoisers operate simultaneously for different lighting effects.</p>
<p>DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction introduces an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained, AI-powered neural network that generates higher-quality pixels in between the sampled rays. It recognizes different ray-traced effects to make smarter decisions about using temporal and spatial data, and retains high frequency information for superior-quality upscaling. And it recognizes lighting patterns from its training data, such as that of global illumination or ambient occlusion, and recreates it in-game.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Portal with RTX | DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction Comparison - Fan Scene" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gg_3-X3d3iY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><i>Portal with RTX</i> is a great example of Ray Reconstruction in action. With DLSS OFF, the denoiser struggles to reconstruct the dynamic shadowing alongside the moving fan.</p>
<p>With DLSS 3.5 and Ray Reconstruction enabled, the denoiser is trained on AI and recognizes certain patterns associated with shadows and keeps the image stable, accumulating accurate pixels while blending neighboring pixels to generate high-quality reflections.</p>
<h2><b>Deep Learning, Deep Gaming</b></h2>
<p>Ray Reconstruction is just one of the AI graphics breakthroughs that multiply performance in DLSS. Super Resolution, the cornerstone of DLSS, samples multiple lower resolution images and uses motion data and feedback from prior frames to reconstruct native-quality images. The result is high image quality without sacrificing game performance.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA DLSS 3 | AI-Powered Performance In Your Favorite Games &amp; Apps" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GKpURmnNMoA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>DLSS 3 introduced Frame Generation, which boosts performance by using AI to analyze data from surrounding frames to predict what the next generated frame should look like. These generated frames are then inserted in between rendered frames. Combining the DLSS-generated frames with DLSS Super Resolution enables DLSS 3 to reconstruct seven-eighths of the displayed pixels with AI, boosting frame rates by up to 4x compared to without DLSS.</p>
<p>Because DLSS Frame Generation is post-processed (applied after the main render) on the GPU, it can boost frame rates even when the game is bottlenecked by the CPU.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>NVIDIA announced today its acceleration of Microsoft’s new Phi-3 Mini open language model with <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/tree/main">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a>, an open-source library for optimizing large language model inference when running on NVIDIA GPUs from PC to Cloud.</p>
<p>Phi-3 Mini packs the capability of 10x larger models and is licensed for both research and broad commercial usage, advancing Phi-2 from its research-only roots. Workstations with NVIDIA RTX GPUs or PCs with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/buy/">GeForce RTX GPUs</a> have the performance to run the model locally using Windows DirectML with <a href="http://aka.ms/phi3-optimizations">ONNX Runtime</a> or TensorRT-LLM.</p>
<p>The model has 3.8 billion parameters and was trained on 3.3 trillion tokens in only seven days on 512 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs.</p>
<p>Phi-3 Mini has two variants, with one supporting 4k tokens and the other supporting 128K tokens and that is the first model in its class for very long contexts. This allows developers to use 128,000 tokens — the atomic parts of language that the model processes — when asking the model a question, which results in more relevant responses from the model.</p>
<p>Developers can try Phi-3 Mini with the 128K context window at <a href="http://ai.nvidia.com">ai.nvidia.com</a>, where it is packaged as an NVIDIA NIM, a microservice with a standard application programming interface that can be deployed anywhere.</p>
<h2><b>Creating Efficiency for the Edge </b></h2>
<p>Developers working on autonomous robotics and embedded devices can learn to create and deploy generative AI through community-driven tutorials, like on <a href="https://www.jetson-ai-lab.com/">Jetson AI Lab</a>, and deploy Phi-3 on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a>.</p>
<p>With only 3.8 billion parameters, the Phi-3 Mini model is compact enough to run efficiently on edge devices. Parameters are like knobs, in memory, that have been precisely tuned during the model training process so that the model can respond with high accuracy to input prompts.</p>
<p>Phi-3 can assist in cost- and resource-constrained use cases, especially for simpler tasks. The model can outperform some larger models on key language benchmarks while delivering results within latency requirements.</p>
<p>TensorRT-LLM will support Phi-3 Mini’s long context window and uses many optimizations and kernels such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.13753v1#S1">LongRoPE</a>, FP8 and inflight batching, which improve inference throughput and latency. The TensorRT-LLM implementations will soon be available in the examples folder on <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/tree/main/examples">GitHub</a>. There, developers can convert to the TensorRT-LLM checkpoint format, which is optimized for inference and can be easily deployed with <a href="https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Developing Open Systems</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA is an active contributor to the open-source ecosystem and has released over 500 projects under open-source licenses.</p>
<p>Contributing to many external projects such as JAX, Kubernetes, OpenUSD, PyTorch and the Linux kernel, NVIDIA supports a wide variety of open-source foundations and standards bodies as well.</p>
<p>Today’s news expands on long-standing NVIDIA collaborations with Microsoft, which have paved the way for innovations including accelerating <a href="https://onnxruntime.ai/blogs">DirectML</a>, Azure cloud, generative AI research, and healthcare and life sciences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>NVIDIA today announced optimizations across all its platforms to accelerate <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/">Meta Llama 3</a>, the latest generation of the large language model (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">LLM</a>).</p>
<p>The open model combined with NVIDIA <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/">accelerated computing</a> equips developers, researchers and businesses to innovate responsibly across a wide variety of applications.</p>
<h2><b>Trained on NVIDIA AI</b></h2>
<p>Meta engineers trained Llama 3 on computer clusters packing 24,576 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, linked with RoCE and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/">NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand</a> networks.</p>
<p>To further advance the state of the art in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>, Meta <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/12/data-center-engineering/building-metas-genai-infrastructure/">recently described</a> plans to scale its infrastructure to 350,000 H100 GPUs.</p>
<h2><b>Putting Llama 3 to Work</b></h2>
<p>Versions of Llama 3, accelerated on NVIDIA GPUs, are available today for use in the cloud, data center, edge and PC.</p>
<p>From a browser, developers can try Llama 3 at <a href="http://ai.nvidia.com">ai.nvidia.com</a>. It’s packaged as an <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-nim-offers-optimized-inference-microservices-for-deploying-ai-models-at-scale/">NVIDIA NIM</a> microservice with a standard application programming interface that can be deployed anywhere.</p>
<p>Businesses can fine-tune Llama 3 with their data using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/nemo/">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, an open-source framework for LLMs that’s part of the secure, supported <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> platform. Custom models can be optimized for inference with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-supercharges-large-language-model-inference-on-nvidia-h100-gpus/">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a> and deployed with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/triton-inference-server/">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Taking Llama 3 to Devices and PCs</b></h2>
<p>Llama 3 also runs on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson Orin</a> for robotics and edge computing devices, creating interactive agents like those in the <a href="https://www.jetson-ai-lab.com/">Jetson AI Lab</a>.</p>
<p>What’s more, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/">GeForce RTX</a> GPUs for workstations and PCs speed inference on Llama 3. These systems give developers a target of more than 100 million NVIDIA-accelerated systems worldwide.</p>
<h2><b>Get Optimal Performance with Llama 3</b></h2>
<p>Best practices in deploying an LLM for a chatbot involves a balance of low latency, good reading speed and optimal GPU use to reduce costs.</p>
<p>Such a service needs to deliver tokens — the rough equivalent of words to an LLM — at about twice a user’s reading speed which is about 10 tokens/second.</p>
<p>Applying these metrics, a single <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h200/">NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPU</a> generated about 3,000 tokens/second — enough to serve about 300 simultaneous users — in an initial test using the version of Llama 3 with 70 billion parameters.</p>
<p>That means a single <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/hgx/">NVIDIA HGX</a> server with eight H200 GPUs could deliver 24,000 tokens/second, further optimizing costs by supporting more than 2,400 users at the same time.</p>
<p>For edge devices, the version of Llama 3 with eight billion parameters generated up to 40 tokens/second on Jetson AGX Orin and 15 tokens/second on Jetson Orin Nano.</p>
<h2><b>Advancing Community Models</b></h2>
<p>An active open-source contributor, NVIDIA is committed to optimizing community software that helps users address their toughest challenges. Open-source models also promote AI transparency and let users broadly share work on AI safety and resilience.</p>
<p>Learn more about how NVIDIA’s AI inference platform, including how NIM, TensorRT-LLM and Triton use state-of-the-art techniques such as <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/tune-and-deploy-lora-llms-with-nvidia-tensorrt-llm/">low-rank adaptation</a> to accelerate the latest LLMs.</p>

</ul>
<p>Riot Games shared in its 14.8 patch notes that it will soon add its Vanguard security software to <i>League of Legends</i> as part of the publisher’s commitment to remove scripters, bots and bot-leveled accounts from the game and make it more challenging for them to continue. Since Vanguard won’t support virtual machines when it’s added to <i>League of Legends</i>, the game will be put under maintenance and will no longer be playable on GeForce NOW once the 14.9 update goes live globally — currently planned for May 1, 2024. Members can continue to enjoy the game on GeForce NOW until then.</p>
