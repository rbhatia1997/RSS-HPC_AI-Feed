										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The telecommunications industry — the backbone of today’s interconnected world — is valued at a staggering $1.7 trillion globally, <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS51360523">according to IDC</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a massive operation, as telcos process hundreds of petabytes of data in their networks each day. That magnitude is only increasing, as the total amount of data transacted globally is forecast to grow to more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/">180 zettabytes by 2025</a>.</p>
<p>To meet this demand for data processing and analysis, telcos are turning to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>, which is improving efficiency and productivity across industries.</p>
<p>NVIDIA announced an <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-introduces-generative-ai-foundry-service-on-microsoft-azure-for-enterprises-and-startups-worldwide">AI foundry service</a> — a collection of NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a> framework and tools, and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a> AI supercomputing and services — that gives enterprises an end-to-end solution for creating and optimizing custom generative AI models.</p>
<p>Using the AI foundry service, Amdocs, a leading provider of software and services for communications and media providers, will optimize enterprise-grade <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">large language models</a> for the telco and media industries to efficiently deploy generative AI use cases across their businesses, from customer experiences to network operations and provisioning. The LLMs will run on NVIDIA accelerated computing as part of the <a href="https://www.amdocs.com/products-services/amaiz-telco-grade-genai-framework">Amdocs amAIz framework</a>.</p>
<p>The collaboration builds on the previously announced <a href="https://www.amdocs.com/news-press/amdocs-and-microsoft-expand-strategic-partnership-reimagine-telco-experience">Amdocs-Microsoft partnership</a>, enabling service providers to adopt these applications in secure, trusted environments, including on premises and in the cloud.</p>
<h2><b>Custom Models for Custom Results</b></h2>
<p>While preliminary applications of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> used broad datasets, enterprises have become increasingly focused on developing custom models to perform specialized, industry-specific skills.</p>
<p>By training models on proprietary data, telcos can deliver tailored solutions that produce more accurate results for their use cases.</p>
<p>To simplify the development, tuning and deployment of such custom models, Amdocs is integrating the new NVIDIA AI foundry service.</p>
<p>Equipped with these new generative AI capabilities — including <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-chatbot-guardrails-nemo/">guardrail</a> features — service providers can enhance performance, optimize resource utilization and flexibly scale to meet future needs.</p>
<h2><b>Amdocs’ Global Telco Ecosystem Footprint</b></h2>
<p>More than 350 of the world’s leading telecom and media companies across 90 countries take advantage of Amdocs services each day, including 27 of the world’s top 30 service providers, according to OMDIA.<sup>(1)</sup> Powering more than 1.7 billion daily digital journeys, Amdocs platforms impact more than 3 billion people around the world.</p>
<p>NVIDIA and Amdocs are exploring several generative AI use cases to simplify and improve operations by providing secure, cost-effective, and high-performance generative AI capabilities.</p>
<p>Initial use cases span customer care, including accelerating resolution of customer inquiries by drawing information from across company data.</p>
<p>And in network operations, the companies are exploring ways to generate solutions to address configuration, coverage or performance issues as they arise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Automotive companies are transforming every phase of their product lifecycle — evolving their primarily physical, manual processes into software-driven, AI-enhanced digital systems.</p>
<p>To help them save costs and reduce lead times, NVIDIA is announcing two new simulation engines on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/cloud/">Omniverse Cloud</a>: the virtual factory simulation engine and the autonomous vehicle (AV) simulation engine.</p>
<p>Omniverse Cloud, a platform-as-a-service for developing and deploying applications for industrial digitalization, is hosted on Microsoft Azure. This one-stop shop enables automakers worldwide to unify digitalization across their core product and business processes. It allows enterprises to achieve faster production and more efficient operations, improving time to market and enhancing sustainability initiatives.</p>
<p>For design, engineering and manufacturing teams, digitalization streamlines their work, converting once primarily manual industrial processes into efficient systems for concept and styling; AV development, testing and validation; and factory planning.</p>
<h2><b>Virtual Factory Simulation Engine</b></h2>
<p>The Omniverse Cloud virtual factory simulation engine is a collection of customizable developer applications and services that enable factory planning teams to connect large-scale industrial datasets while collaborating, navigating and reviewing them in real time.</p>
<p>Design teams working with 3D data can assemble virtual factories and share their work with thousands of planners who can view, annotate and update the full-fidelity factory dataset from lightweight devices. By simulating virtual factories on Omniverse Cloud, automakers can increase throughput and production quality while saving years of effort and millions of dollars that would result from making changes once construction is underway.</p>
<p>On Omniverse Cloud, teams can create interoperability between existing software applications such as Autodesk Factory Planning, which supports the entire lifecycle for building, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing and factory lines, as well as Siemens’ NX, Process Simulate and Teamcenter Visualization software and the JT file format. They can share knowledge and data in real time in live, virtual factory reviews across 2D devices or in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-extended-reality/">extended reality</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/t-systems-announces-digital-twin-offering-powered-by-nvidia-omniverse-1051446">T-Systems</a>, a leading IT solutions provider for Europe’s largest automotive manufacturers, is building and deploying a custom virtual factory application that its customers can deploy in Omniverse Cloud.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/our-partners/nvidia-omniverse">SoftServe</a>, an elite member of the NVIDIA Service Delivery Partner program, is also developing custom factory simulation and visualization solutions on this Omniverse Cloud engine, covering factory design, production planning and control.</p>
<h2><b>AV Simulation Engine</b></h2>
<p>The AV simulation engine is a service that delivers physically based sensor simulation, enabling AV and robotics developers to run autonomous systems in a closed-loop virtual environment.</p>
<p>The next generation of AV architectures will be built on large, unified AI models that combine layers of the vehicle stack, including perception, planning and control. Such new architectures call for an integrated approach to development.</p>
<p>With previous architectures, developers could train and test these layers independently, as they were governed by different models. For example, simulation could be used to develop a vehicle’s planning and control system, which only needs basic information about objects in a scene — such as the speed and distance of surrounding vehicles — while perception networks could be trained and tested on recorded sensor data.</p>
<p>However, using simulation to develop an advanced unified AV architecture requires sensor data as the input. For a simulator to be effective, it must be able to simulate vehicle sensors, such as cameras, radars and lidars, with high fidelity.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, NVIDIA is bringing state-of-the-art sensor simulation pipelines used in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/simulation/">DRIVE Sim</a> and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim">Isaac Sim</a> to Omniverse Cloud on Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>Omniverse Cloud sensor simulation provides AV and robotics workflows with high-fidelity, physically based simulation for cameras, radars, lidars and other types of sensors. It can be connected to existing simulation applications, whether developed in-house or provided by a third party, via Omniverse Cloud application programming interfaces for integration into workflows.</p>
<h2><b>Fast Track to Digitalization</b></h2>
<p>The factory simulation engine is now available to customers via an Omniverse Cloud enterprise private offer through the <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/nvidia.nvidia-omniverse-cloud?tab=Overview">Azure Marketplace</a>, which provides access to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ovx/">NVIDIA OVX</a> systems and fully managed Omniverse software, reference applications and workflows. The sensor simulation engine is coming soon.</p>
<p>Enterprises can now also deploy <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/enterprise/">Omniverse Enterprise</a> on new <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/nvidia.nvidia-omniverse-workstation?tab=Overview">optimized Azure virtual machines</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>To understand the latest advance in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>, imagine a courtroom.</p>
<p>Judges hear and decide cases based on their general understanding of the law. Sometimes a case — like a malpractice suit or a labor dispute —  requires special expertise, so judges send court clerks to a law library, looking for precedents and specific cases they can cite.</p>
<p>Like a good judge, large language models (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">LLMs</a>) can respond to a wide variety of human queries. But to deliver authoritative answers that cite sources, the model needs an assistant to do some research.</p>
<p>The court clerk of AI is a process called retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG for short.</p>
<h2><b>The Story of the Name</b></h2>
<p>Patrick Lewis, lead author of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401.pdf">2020 paper that coined the term</a>, apologized for the unflattering acronym that now describes a growing family of methods across hundreds of papers and dozens of commercial services he believes represent the future of generative AI.</p>

<p>“We definitely would have put more thought into the name had we known our work would become so widespread,” Lewis said in an interview from Singapore, where he was sharing his ideas with a regional conference of database developers.</p>
<p>“We always planned to have a nicer sounding name, but when it came time to write the paper, no one had a better idea,” said Lewis, who now leads a RAG team at AI startup Cohere.</p>
<h2><b>So, What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?</b></h2>
<p>Retrieval-augmented generation is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with facts fetched from external sources.</p>
<p>In other words, it fills a gap in how LLMs work. Under the hood, LLMs are neural networks, typically measured by how many parameters they contain. An LLM’s parameters essentially represent the general patterns of how humans use words to form sentences.</p>
<p>That deep understanding, sometimes called parameterized knowledge, makes LLMs useful in responding to general prompts at light speed. However, it does not serve users who want a deeper dive into a current or more specific topic.</p>
<h2><b>Combining Internal, External Resources</b></h2>
<p>Lewis and colleagues developed retrieval-augmented generation to link generative AI services to external resources, especially ones rich in the latest technical details.</p>
<p>The paper, with coauthors from the former Facebook AI Research (now Meta AI), University College London and New York University, called RAG “a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe” because it can be used by nearly any LLM to connect with practically any external resource.</p>
<h2><b>Building User Trust</b></h2>
<p>Retrieval-augmented generation gives models sources they can cite, like footnotes in a research paper, so users can check any claims. That builds trust.</p>
<p>What’s more, the technique can help models clear up ambiguity in a user query. It also reduces the possibility a model will make a wrong guess, a phenomenon sometimes called hallucination.</p>
<p>Another great advantage of RAG is it’s relatively easy. A <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/">blog</a> by Lewis and three of the paper’s coauthors said developers can implement the process with as few as <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/rag-token-nq">five lines of code</a>.</p>
<p>That makes the method faster and less expensive than retraining a model with additional datasets. And it lets users hot-swap new sources on the fly.</p>
<h2><b>How People Are Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation </b></h2>
<p>With retrieval-augmented generation, users can essentially have conversations with data repositories, opening up new kinds of experiences. This means the applications for RAG could be multiple times the number of available datasets.</p>
<p>For example, a generative AI model supplemented with a medical index could be a great assistant for a doctor or nurse. Financial analysts would benefit from an assistant linked to market data.</p>
<p>In fact, almost any business can turn its technical or policy manuals, videos or logs into resources called knowledge bases that can enhance LLMs. These sources can enable use cases such as customer or field support, employee training and developer productivity.</p>
<p>The broad potential is why companies including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/simplify-access-to-internal-information-using-retrieval-augmented-generation-and-langchain-agents/">AWS</a>, <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG">IBM</a>, <a href="https://www.glean.com/">Glean</a>, Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/">Oracle</a> and <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/">Pinecone</a> are adopting RAG.</p>
<h2><b>Getting Started With Retrieval-Augmented Generation </b></h2>
<p>To help users get started, NVIDIA developed a <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-enterprise/workflows-generative-ai/0.1.0/technical-brief.html">reference architecture for retrieval-augmented generation</a>. It includes a sample chatbot and the elements users need to create their own applications with this new method.</p>
<p>The workflow uses <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, a framework for developing and customizing generative AI models, as well as software like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/triton-inference-server/">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a> and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-inference-on-llms-with-tensorrt-llm-now-publicly-available/">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a> for running generative AI models in production.</p>
<p>The software components are all part of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a>, a software platform that accelerates development and deployment of production-ready AI with the security, support and stability businesses need.</p>
<p>Getting the best performance for RAG workflows requires massive amounts of memory and compute to move and process data. The <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/gh200-grace-hopper-superchip-with-hbm3e-memory">NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip</a>, with its 288GB of fast HBM3e memory and 8 petaflops of compute, is ideal — it can deliver a 150x speedup over using a CPU.</p>
<p>Once companies get familiar with RAG, they can combine a variety of off-the-shelf or custom LLMs with internal or external knowledge bases to create a wide range of assistants that help their employees and customers.</p>
<p>RAG doesn’t require a data center. LLMs are debuting on Windows PCs, thanks to NVIDIA software that enables all sorts of applications users can access even on their laptops.</p>

<p>PCs equipped with NVIDIA RTX GPUs can now run some AI models locally. By using RAG on a PC, users can link to a private knowledge source – whether that be emails, notes or articles – to improve responses. The user can then feel confident that their data source, prompts and response all remain private and secure.</p>

<h2><b>The History of Retrieval-Augmented Generation </b></h2>
<p>The roots of the technique go back at least to the early 1970s. That’s when researchers in information retrieval prototyped what they called question-answering systems, apps that use natural language processing (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/natural-language-processing/">NLP</a>) to access text, initially in narrow topics such as baseball.</p>
<p>The concepts behind this kind of text mining have remained fairly constant over the years. But the machine learning engines driving them have grown significantly, increasing their usefulness and popularity.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, the Ask Jeeves service, now Ask.com, popularized question answering with its mascot of a well-dressed valet. IBM’s Watson became a TV celebrity in 2011 when it handily beat two human champions on the <i>Jeopardy!</i> game show.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ask-Jeeves-2.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68140" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ask-Jeeves-2.jpg" alt="Picture of Ask Jeeves, an early RAG-like web service" width="620" height="334" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ask-Jeeves-2.jpg 620w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ask-Jeeves-2-400x215.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ask-Jeeves-2-399x215.jpg 399w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ask-Jeeves-2-186x100.jpg 186w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>Today, LLMs are taking question-answering systems to a whole new level.</p>
<h2><b>Insights From a London Lab</b></h2>
<p>The seminal 2020 paper arrived as Lewis was pursuing a doctorate in NLP at University College London and working for Meta at a new London AI lab. The team was searching for ways to pack more knowledge into an LLM’s parameters and using a benchmark it developed to measure its progress.</p>
<p>Building on earlier methods and inspired by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08909.pdf">a paper</a> from Google researchers, the group “had this compelling vision of a trained system that had a retrieval index in the middle of it, so it could learn and generate any text output you wanted,” Lewis recalled.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68146" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68146" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IBM-Watson-wins-Jeopardy-YT.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-68146 size-full" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IBM-Watson-wins-Jeopardy-YT.jpg" alt="Picture of IBM Watson winning on &quot;Jeopardy&quot; TV show, popularizing a RAG-like AI service" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IBM-Watson-wins-Jeopardy-YT.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IBM-Watson-wins-Jeopardy-YT-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IBM-Watson-wins-Jeopardy-YT-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IBM-Watson-wins-Jeopardy-YT-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IBM-Watson-wins-Jeopardy-YT-800x450.jpg 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IBM-Watson-wins-Jeopardy-YT-382x215.jpg 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IBM-Watson-wins-Jeopardy-YT-178x100.jpg 178w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68146" class="wp-caption-text">The IBM Watson question-answering system became a celebrity when it won big on the TV game show Jeopardy!</figcaption></figure>
<p>When Lewis plugged into the work in progress a promising retrieval system from another Meta team, the first results were unexpectedly impressive.</p>
<p>“I showed my supervisor and he said, ‘Whoa, take the win. This sort of thing doesn’t happen very often,’ because these workflows can be hard to set up correctly the first time,” he said.</p>
<p>Lewis also credits major contributions from team members Ethan Perez and Douwe Kiela, then of New York University and Facebook AI Research, respectively.</p>
<p>When complete, the work, which ran on a cluster of NVIDIA GPUs, showed how to make generative AI models more authoritative and trustworthy. It’s since been cited by hundreds of papers that amplified and extended the concepts in what continues to be an active area of research.</p>
<h2><b>How Retrieval-Augmented Generation Works</b></h2>
<p>At a high level, here’s how an <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-enterprise/workflows-generative-ai/0.1.0/technical-brief.html">NVIDIA technical brief</a> describes the RAG process.</p>
<p>When users ask an LLM a question, the AI model sends the query to another model that converts it into a numeric format so machines can read it. The numeric version of the query is sometimes called an embedding or a vector.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68152" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68152" style="width: 2048px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA-RAG-diagram-scaled.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-68152 size-full" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA-RAG-diagram-scaled.jpg" alt="NVIDIA diagram of how RAG works with LLMs" width="2048" height="901" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA-RAG-diagram-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA-RAG-diagram-400x176.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA-RAG-diagram-672x296.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA-RAG-diagram-768x338.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA-RAG-diagram-1536x676.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA-RAG-diagram-842x370.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA-RAG-diagram-406x179.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA-RAG-diagram-188x83.jpg 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA-RAG-diagram-1280x563.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68152" class="wp-caption-text">Retrieval-augmented generation combines LLMs with embedding models and vector databases.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The embedding model then compares these numeric values to vectors in a machine-readable index of an available knowledge base. When it finds a match or multiple matches, it retrieves the related data, converts it to human-readable words and passes it back to the LLM.</p>
<p>Finally, the LLM combines the retrieved words and its own response to the query into a final answer it presents to the user, potentially citing sources the embedding model found.</p>
<h2><b>Keeping Sources Current</b></h2>
<p>In the background, the embedding model continuously creates and updates machine-readable indices, sometimes called vector databases, for new and updated knowledge bases as they become available.</p>

<p>Many developers find LangChain, an open-source library, can be particularly useful in chaining together LLMs, embedding models and knowledge bases. NVIDIA uses LangChain in its reference architecture for retrieval-augmented generation.</p>
<p>The LangChain community provides its own <a href="https://blog.langchain.dev/tutorial-chatgpt-over-your-data/">description of a RAG process</a>.</p>
<p>Looking forward, the future of generative AI lies in creatively chaining all sorts of LLMs and knowledge bases together to create new kinds of assistants that deliver authoritative results users can verify.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Artificial intelligence on Windows 11 PCs marks a pivotal moment in tech history, revolutionizing experiences for gamers, creators, streamers, office workers, students and even casual PC users.</p>
<p>It offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance productivity for users of the more than 100 million Windows PCs and workstations that are powered by RTX GPUs. And NVIDIA RTX technology is making it even easier for developers to create AI applications to change the way people use computers.</p>
<p>New optimizations, models and resources announced at Microsoft Ignite will help developers deliver new end-user experiences, quicker.</p>
<p>An upcoming update to <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt">TensorRT-LLM</a> — open-source software that increases AI inference performance — will add support for new <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">large language models</a> and make demanding AI workloads more accessible on desktops and laptops with RTX GPUs starting at 8GB of VRAM.</p>
<p>TensorRT-LLM for Windows will soon be compatible with OpenAI’s popular Chat API through a new wrapper. This will enable hundreds of developer projects and applications to run locally on a PC with RTX, instead of in the cloud — so users can keep private and proprietary data on Windows 11 PCs.</p>
<p>Custom generative AI requires time and energy to maintain projects. The process can become incredibly complex and time-consuming, especially when trying to collaborate and deploy across multiple environments and platforms.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/">AI Workbench</a> is a unified, easy-to-use toolkit that allows developers to quickly create, test and customize pretrained generative AI models and LLMs on a PC or workstation. It provides developers a single platform to organize their AI projects and tune models to specific use cases.</p>
<p>This enables seamless collaboration and deployment for developers to create cost-effective, scalable generative AI models quickly. <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ai-workbench-early-access">Join the early access list</a> to be among the first to gain access to this growing initiative and to receive future updates.</p>
<p>To support AI developers, NVIDIA and Microsoft will release DirectML enhancements to accelerate one of the most popular foundational AI models, Llama 2. Developers now have more options for cross-vendor deployment, in addition to setting <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tensorrt-llm-windows-stable-diffusion-rtx/">a new standard for performance</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Portable AI</b></h2>
<p>Last month, NVIDIA announced TensorRT-LLM for Windows, a library for accelerating LLM inference.</p>
<p>The next TensorRT-LLM release, v0.6.0 coming later this month, will bring improved inference performance — up to 5x faster — and enable support for additional popular LLMs, including the new Mistral 7B and Nemotron-3 8B. Versions of these LLMs will run on any GeForce RTX 30 Series and 40 Series GPU with 8GB of RAM or more, making fast, accurate, local LLM capabilities accessible even in some of the most portable Windows devices.</p>

<p>The new release of TensorRT-LLM will be available for install on the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-inference-on-llms-with-tensorrt-llm-now-publicly-available/">/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM</a> GitHub repo. New optimized models will be available on <a href="http://ngc.nvidia.com">ngc.nvidia.com</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Conversing With Confidence </b></h2>
<p>Developers and enthusiasts worldwide use OpenAI’s Chat API for a wide range of applications — from summarizing web content and drafting documents and emails to analyzing and visualizing data and creating presentations.</p>
<p>One challenge with such cloud-based AIs is that they require users to upload their input data, making them impractical for private or proprietary data or for working with large datasets.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, NVIDIA is soon enabling TensorRT-LLM for Windows to offer a similar API interface to OpenAI&#8217;s widely popular ChatAPI, through a new wrapper, offering a similar workflow to developers whether they are designing models and applications to run locally on a PC with RTX or in the cloud. By changing just one or two lines of code, hundreds of AI-powered developer projects and applications can now benefit from fast, local AI. Users can keep their data on their PCs and not worry about uploading datasets to the cloud.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="TensorRT-LLM OpenAI Chat API Integration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-P17YXulhDc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps the best part is that many of these projects and applications are open source, making it easy for developers to leverage and extend their capabilities to fuel the adoption of generative AI on Windows, powered by RTX.</p>
<p>The wrapper will work with any LLM that’s been optimized for TensorRT-LLM (for example, Llama 2, Mistral and NV LLM) and is being released as a reference project on GitHub, alongside other developer resources for working with LLMs on RTX.</p>
<h2><b>Model Acceleration</b></h2>
<p>Developers can now leverage cutting-edge AI models and deploy with a cross-vendor API. As part of an ongoing commitment to empower developers, NVIDIA and Microsoft have been working together to accelerate Llama on RTX via the DirectML API.</p>
<p>Building on the announcements for the fastest inference performance for these models announced last month, this new option for cross-vendor deployment makes it easier than ever to bring AI capabilities to PC.</p>
<p>Developers and enthusiasts can experience the latest optimizations by downloading the latest ONNX runtime and following the installation instructions from Microsoft, and installing the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx">latest driver from NVIDIA</a>, which will be available on Nov. 21.</p>
<p>These new optimizations, models and resources will accelerate the development and deployment of AI features and applications to the 100 million RTX PCs worldwide, joining the more than 400 partners shipping AI-powered apps and games already accelerated by RTX GPUs.</p>
<p>As models become even more accessible and developers bring more generative AI-powered functionality to RTX-powered Windows PCs, RTX GPUs will be critical for enabling users to take advantage of this powerful technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of our weekly </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/in-the-nvidia-studio/"><i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/"><i>NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> technology improves creative workflows.

<p>Character animator Sir Wade Neistadt works to make animation and 3D education more accessible for aspiring and professional artists alike through video tutorials and industry training.</p>
<p>The YouTube creator, who goes by Sir Wade, also likes a challenge. When electronics company Razer recently asked him to create something unique and creative using the new <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-18">Razer Blade 18</a> laptop with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/laptops/">GeForce RTX 4090 graphics</a>, Sir Wade obliged.</p>
<p>“I said yes because I thought it’d be a great opportunity to try something creatively risky and make something I didn’t yet know how to achieve,” the artist said.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="I Created a VFX Robot Animation in Blender + Maya" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BJ4WiyNpyLM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>I, Robot</b></h2>
<p>One of the hardest parts of getting started on a project is needing to be creative on demand, said Sir Wade. For the Razer piece, the animator started by asking himself two questions: “What am I inspired by?” and “What do I have to work with?”</p>
<p>Sir Wade finds inspiration in games, technology, movies, people-watching and conversations. Fond of tech — and having eyed <a href="https://prorigs.com/characters/">characters from the ProRigs library</a> for some time — he decided his short animation should feature robots.</p>
<p>When creating a concept for the animation, Sir Wade took an unorthodox approach, skipping the popular step of 2D sketching. Instead, he captured video references by acting out the animations himself.</p>
<p>This gave Sir Wade the opportunity to quickly try a bunch of movements and preview body mechanics for the animation phase. Since ProRigs characters are rigs based on Autodesk Maya, he naturally began his animation work using this 3D software.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68090" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68090" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-you-shall-not-render-pass-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-68090" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-you-shall-not-render-pass-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-you-shall-not-render-pass-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-you-shall-not-render-pass-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-you-shall-not-render-pass-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-you-shall-not-render-pass-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-you-shall-not-render-pass-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-you-shall-not-render-pass-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-you-shall-not-render-pass-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68090" class="wp-caption-text">“YOU SHALL NOT (RENDER) PASS.”</figcaption></figure>
<p>His initial approach was straightforward: mimicking the main robot character’s movements with the edited reference footage. This worked fairly well, as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a>-accelerated ray tracing and AI denoising with the default Autodesk Arnold renderer resulted in smooth viewport movement and photorealistic visuals.</p>
<p>Then, Sir Wade continued tinkering with the piece, focusing on how the robot’s arm plates crashed into each other and how its feet moved. This was a great challenge, but he kept moving on the project. The featured artist would advise, “Don’t wait for everything to be perfect.”</p>

<p>Next, Sir Wade exported files into Blender software with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)</a> framework, unlocking an open and extensible ecosystem, including the ability to make edits in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/creators/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a development platform for building and connecting 3D tools and applications. The edits could then be captured in the original native files, eliminating the need for tedious uploading, downloading and file reformatting.</p>

<p>Sir Wade browsed the Kitbash3D digital platform with the new asset browser Cargo to compile kits, models and materials, and drag them into Blender with ease. It’s important at this stage to get base-level models in the scene, he said, so the environment can be further refined.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68099" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68099" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-laptop-view-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-68099" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-laptop-view-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-laptop-view-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-laptop-view-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-laptop-view-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-laptop-view-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-laptop-view-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-laptop-view-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-sir-wade-neistadt-wk83-laptop-view-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68099" class="wp-caption-text">Dubbed the “ultimate desktop replacement,” the Razer Blade 18 offers NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 graphics.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sir Wade raved about the Razer Blade 18’s quad-high-definition (QHD+) 18&#8243; screen and 16:10 aspect ratio, which gives him more room to create, as well as its color-calibrated display, which ensures uploads to social media are as accurate as possible and require minimal color correction.</p>
<p>The preinstalled NVIDIA Studio Drivers, free to RTX GPU owners, are extensively tested with the most popular creative software to deliver maximum stability and performance.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>“This is by far the best laptop I’ve ever used for this type of work.” — Sir Wade Neistadt</p>
</div>
<p>Returning to the action, Sir Wade used an emission shader to form the projectiles aimed at the robot. He also tweaked various textures, such as surface imperfections, to make the robot feel more weathered and battle-worn, before moving on to visual effects (VFX).</p>
<p>The artist used basic primitives as particle emitters in Blender to achieve the look of bursting particles over a limited number of frames. This, combined with the robot and floor surfaces containing surface nodes, creates sparks when the robot moves or gets hit by objects.</p>
<p>Sir Wade’s GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU with Blender Cycles RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport provides interactive, photorealistic rendering for modeling and animation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA today unveiled at SC23 the next wave of technologies that will lift scientific and industrial research centers worldwide to new levels of performance and energy efficiency.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA hardware and software innovations are creating a new class of AI supercomputers,” said Ian Buck, vice president of the company’s high performance computing and hyperscale data center business, in a special address at the conference.</p>
<p>Some of the systems will pack memory-enhanced <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-hopper-architecture-in-depth/">NVIDIA Hopper accelerators</a>, others a new <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-grace-hopper-superchip-powers-jupiter-defining-a-new-class-of-supercomputers-to-propel-ai-for-scientific-discovery">NVIDIA Grace Hopper systems architecture</a>. All will use the expanded parallelism to run a full stack of accelerated software for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>, HPC and hybrid <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-quantum-computing/">quantum computing</a>.</p>
<p>Buck described the new <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-supercharges-hopper-the-worlds-leading-ai-computing-platform">NVIDIA HGX H200</a> as “the world’s leading AI computing platform.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_68062" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68062" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-68062" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image-672x411.jpg" alt="Image of H200 GPU system" width="672" height="411" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image-672x411.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image-400x244.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image-768x469.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image-737x450.jpg 737w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image-352x215.jpg 352w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image-164x100.jpg 164w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/H200-image.jpg 1231w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68062" class="wp-caption-text">NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs pack HBM3e memory to run growing generative AI models.</figcaption></figure>
<p>It packs up to 141GB of HBM3e, the first AI accelerator to use the ultrafast technology. Running models like GPT-3, NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs provide an 18x performance increase over prior-generation accelerators.</p>
<p><span>Among other </span><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/release/0.5.0/docs/source/blogs/H200launch.md"><span>generative AI benchmarks</span></a><span>, they zip through 12,000 tokens per second on a Llama2-13B large language model (</span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/"><span>LLM</span></a><span>). </span></p>
<p>Buck also revealed a server platform that links four <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/">NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips</a> on an <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-nvidia-nvlink/">NVIDIA NVLink</a> interconnect. The quad configuration puts in a single compute node a whopping 288 Arm Neoverse cores and 16 petaflops of AI performance with up to 2.3 terabytes of high-speed memory.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68065" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68065" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-68065" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration-672x405.jpg" alt="Image of quad GH200 server node" width="672" height="405" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration-672x405.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration-400x241.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration-768x463.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration-747x450.jpg 747w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration-357x215.jpg 357w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration-166x100.jpg 166w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Quad-Grace-Hopper-node-configuration.jpg 1256w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68065" class="wp-caption-text">Server nodes based on the four GH200 Superchips will deliver 16 petaflops of AI performance.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Demonstrating its efficiency, one GH200 Superchip using the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a> open-source library is 100x faster than a dual-socket x86 CPU system and nearly 2x more energy efficient than an X86 + H100 GPU server.</p>
<p>“Accelerated computing is sustainable computing,” Buck said. “By harnessing the power of accelerated computing and generative AI, together we can drive innovation across industries while reducing our impact on the environment.”</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA Powers 38 of 49 New TOP500 Systems</b></h2>
<p>The latest TOP500 list of the world’s fastest supercomputers reflects the shift toward accelerated, energy-efficient supercomputing.</p>
<p>Thanks to new systems powered by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, NVIDIA now delivers more than 2.5 exaflops of HPC performance across these world-leading systems, up from 1.6 exaflops in the May rankings. NVIDIA’s contribution on the top 10 alone reaches nearly an exaflop of HPC and 72 exaflops of AI performance.</p>
<p>The new list contains the highest number of systems ever using NVIDIA technologies, 379 vs. 372 in May, including 38 of 49 new supercomputers on the list.</p>
<p>Microsoft Azure leads the newcomers with its Eagle system using H100 GPUs in NDv5 instances to hit No. 3 with 561 petaflops. Mare Nostrum5 in Barcelona ranked No. 8, and NVIDIA Eos — which recently set <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/scaling-ai-training-mlperf/">new AI training records</a> on the MLPerf benchmarks — came in at No. 9.</p>
<p>Showing their energy efficiency, NVIDIA GPUs power 23 of the top 30 systems on the Green500. And they retained the No. 1 spot with the H100 GPU-based Henri system, which delivers 65.09 gigaflops per watt for the Flatiron Institute in New York.</p>
<h2><b>Gen AI Explores COVID</b></h2>
<p><span>Showing what’s possible</span>, the Argonne National Laboratory used <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/gpu-cloud/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a>, a generative AI platform for biomolecular LLMs, to develop <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-covid-genome-sequences/">GenSLMs</a>, a model that can generate gene sequences that closely resemble real-world variants of the coronavirus. Using NVIDIA GPUs and data from 1.5 million COVID genome sequences, it can also rapidly identify new virus variants.</p>
<p>The work<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/genomic-large-language-model-predicts-covid-variants/"> won the Gordon Bell special prize</a> last year and was trained on supercomputers, including Argonne’s<a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-turbocharges-extreme-scale-ai-for-argonne-national-laboratorys-polaris-supercomputer"> Polaris</a> system, the U.S. Department of Energy’s<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nersc-perlmutter-ai-supercomputer/"> Perlmutter</a> and NVIDIA’s<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/making-selene-pandemic-ai/"> Selene</a>.</p>
<p>It’s “just the tip of the iceberg — the future is brimming with possibilities, as generative AI continues to redefine the landscape of scientific exploration,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA, in the special address.</p>
<h2><b>Saving Time, Money and Energy</b></h2>
<p>Using the latest technologies, accelerated workloads can see an order-of-magnitude reduction in system cost and energy used, Buck said.</p>
<p>For example, Siemens teamed with Mercedes to analyze aerodynamics and related acoustics for its new electric EQE vehicles. The simulations that took weeks on CPU clusters ran significantly faster using the latest NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In addition, Hopper GPUs let them reduce costs by 3x and reduce energy consumption by 4x (below).</p>

<h2><b>Switching on 200 Exaflops Beginning Next Year</b></h2>
<p>Scientific and industrial advances will come from every corner of the globe where the latest systems are <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gh200-grace-hopper-superchip-powers-ai-supercomputers/">being deployed</a>.</p>
<p>“We already see a combined 200 <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-an-exaflop/">exaflops</a> of AI on Grace Hopper supercomputers going to production 2024,” Buck said.</p>
<p>They include the massive <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-grace-hopper-superchip-powers-jupiter-defining-a-new-class-of-supercomputers-to-propel-ai-for-scientific-discovery">JUPITER supercomputer</a> at Germany’s Jülich center. It can deliver 93 exaflops of performance for AI training and 1 exaflop for HPC applications, while consuming only 18.2 megawatts of power.</p>

<p>Based on Eviden’s BullSequana XH3000 liquid-cooled system, JUPITER will use the NVIDIA quad GH200 system architecture and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/">NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand</a> networking for climate and weather predictions, drug discovery, hybrid quantum computing and digital twins. JUPITER quad GH200 nodes will be configured with 864GB of high-speed memory.</p>
<p>It’s one of several new supercomputers using Grace Hopper that NVIDIA announced at SC23.</p>
<p>The HPE Cray EX2500 system from Hewlett Packard Enterprise will use the quad GH200 to power many AI supercomputers coming online next year.</p>
<p>For example, HPE uses the quad GH200 to power OFP-II, an advanced HPC system in Japan shared by the University of Tsukuba and the University of Tokyo, as well as the DeltaAI system, which will triple computing capacity for the U.S. National Center for Supercomputing Applications.</p>
<p>HPE is also building the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/special-address-isc-2022-hpc/">Venado</a> system for the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the first GH200 to be deployed in the U.S. In addition, HPE is building GH200 supercomputers in the Middle East, Switzerland and the U.K.</p>
<h2><b>Grace Hopper in Texas and Beyond</b></h2>
<p>At the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), Dell Technologies is building the Vista supercomputer with NVIDIA Grace Hopper and Grace CPU Superchips.</p>
<p>More than 100 global enterprises and organizations, including NASA Ames Research Center and Total Energies, have already purchased Grace Hopper early-access systems, Buck said.</p>
<p>They join previously announced GH200 users such as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/computex-keynote-generative-ai/">SoftBank</a> and the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/uk-largest-ai-supercomputer/">University of Bristol</a>, as well as the massive <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/supercomputing-ai-eurohpc/">Leonardo</a> system with 14,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs that delivers 10 exaflops of AI performance for Italy’s Cineca consortium.</p>
<h2><b>The View From Supercomputing Centers</b></h2>
<p>Leaders from supercomputing centers around the world shared their plans and work in progress with the latest systems.</p>
<p>“We’ve been collaborating with MeteoSwiss ECMWP as well as scientists from ETH EXCLAIM and NVIDIA’s Earth-2 project to create an infrastructure that will push the envelope in all dimensions of big data analytics and extreme scale computing,” said Thomas Schultess, director of the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre of work on the Alps supercomputer.</p>
<p>“There’s really impressive energy-efficiency gains across our stacks,” Dan Stanzione, executive director of TACC, said of Vista.</p>
<p>It’s “really the stepping stone to move users from the kinds of systems we’ve done in the past to looking at this new Grace Arm CPU and Hopper GPU tightly coupled combination and … we’re looking to scale out by probably a factor of 10 or 15 from what we are deploying with Vista when we deploy Horizon in a couple years,” he said.</p>
<h2><b>Accelerating the Quantum Journey</b></h2>
<p>Researchers are also using today’s accelerated systems to pioneer a path to tomorrow’s supercomputers.</p>
<p>In Germany, JUPITER “will revolutionize scientific research across climate, materials, drug discovery and quantum computing,” said Kristel Michelson, who leads Julich’s research group on quantum information processing.</p>
<p>“JUPITER’s architecture also allows for the seamless integration of quantum algorithms with parallel HPC algorithms, and this is mandatory for effective quantum HPC hybrid simulations,” she said.</p>
<h2><b>CUDA Quantum Drives Progress</b></h2>
<p>The special address also showed how <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-quantum">NVIDIA CUDA Quantum</a> — a platform for programming CPUs, GPUs and quantum computers also known as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-qpu/">QPUs</a> — is advancing research in quantum computing.</p>
<p>For example, researchers at <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/basf-cuda-quantum-momentum/">BASF</a>, the world’s largest chemical company, pioneered a new hybrid quantum-classical method for simulating chemicals that can shield humans against harmful metals. They join researchers at Brookhaven National Laboratory and HPE who are separately pushing the frontiers of science with CUDA Quantum.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also announced a collaboration with Classiq, a developer of quantum programming tools, to create a life sciences research center at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel’s largest teaching hospital.  The center will use Classiq’s software and CUDA Quantum running on an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-h100/">NVIDIA DGX H100 system</a>.</p>
<p>Separately, Quantum Machines will deploy the first <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-quantum/">NVIDIA DGX Quantum</a>, a system using Grace Hopper Superchips, at the Israel National Quantum Center that aims to drive advances across scientific fields. The DGX system will be connected to a superconducting QPU by Quantware and a photonic QPU from ORCA Computing, both powered by CUDA Quantum.</p>

<p>“In just two years, our NVIDIA quantum computing platform has amassed over 120 partners [above], a testament to its open, innovative platform,” Buck said.</p>
<p>Overall, the work across many fields of discovery reveals a new trend that combines accelerated computing at data center scale with NVIDIA’s full-stack innovation.</p>
<p>“Accelerated computing is paving the path for sustainable computing with advancements that provide not just amazing technology but a more sustainable and impactful future,” he concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>A widely acclaimed large language model for genomic data has demonstrated its ability to generate gene sequences that closely resemble real-world variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19.</p>
<p>Called GenSLMs, the model, which last year <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/genomic-large-language-model-predicts-covid-variants/">won the Gordon Bell special prize</a> for high performance computing-based COVID-19 research, was trained on a dataset of nucleotide sequences — the building blocks of DNA and RNA. It was developed by researchers from Argonne National Laboratory, NVIDIA, the University of Chicago and a score of other academic and commercial collaborators.</p>
<p>When the researchers looked back at the nucleotide sequences generated by GenSLMs, they discovered that specific characteristics of the AI-generated sequences closely matched the real-world Eris and Pirola subvariants that have been prevalent this year — even though the AI was only trained on COVID-19 virus genomes from the first year of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Our model’s generative process is extremely naive, lacking any specific information or constraints around what a new COVID variant should look like,” said Arvind Ramanathan, lead researcher on the project and a computational biologist at Argonne. “The AI’s ability to predict the kinds of gene mutations present in recent COVID strains — despite having only seen the Alpha and Beta variants during training — is a strong validation of its capabilities.”</p>
<p>In addition to generating its own sequences, GenSLMs can also classify and cluster different COVID genome sequences by distinguishing between variants. In a <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/genslm">demo available on NGC</a>, NVIDIA’s hub for accelerated software, users can explore visualizations of GenSLMs’ analysis of the evolutionary patterns of various proteins within the COVID viral genome.</p>
<div style="width: 1920px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68026-1" width="1920" height="1080" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GenSLM.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GenSLM.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GenSLM.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Reading Between the Lines, Uncovering Evolutionary Patterns</b></h2>
<p>A key feature of GenSLMs is its ability to interpret long strings of nucleotides — represented with sequences of the letters A, T, G and C in DNA, or A, U, G and C in RNA — in the same way an LLM trained on English text would interpret a sentence. This capability enables the model to understand the relationship between different areas of the genome, which in coronaviruses consists of around 30,000 nucleotides.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/genslm">NGC demo</a>, users can choose from among eight different COVID variants to understand how the AI model tracks mutations across various proteins of the viral genome. The visualization depicts evolutionary couplings across the viral proteins — highlighting which snippets of the genome are likely to be seen in a given variant.</p>
<p>“Understanding how different parts of the genome are co-evolving gives us clues about how the virus may develop new vulnerabilities or new forms of resistance,” Ramanathan said. “Looking at the model’s understanding of which mutations are particularly strong in a variant may help scientists with downstream tasks like determining how a specific strain can evade the human immune system.”</p>
<div style="width: 1080px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68026-2" width="1080" height="1080" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SLM.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SLM.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SLM.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GenSLMs was trained on more than 110 million prokaryotic genome sequences and fine-tuned with a global dataset of around 1.5 million COVID viral sequences using open-source data from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center. In the future, the model could be fine-tuned on the genomes of other viruses or bacteria, enabling new research applications.</p>
<p>To train the model, the researchers used <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU</a>-powered supercomputers, including Argonne’s <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-turbocharges-extreme-scale-ai-for-argonne-national-laboratorys-polaris-supercomputer">Polaris</a> system, the U.S. Department of Energy’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nersc-perlmutter-ai-supercomputer/">Perlmutter</a> and NVIDIA’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/making-selene-pandemic-ai/">Selene</a>.</p>
<p>The GenSLMs research team’s Gordon Bell special prize was awarded at last year’s SC22 supercomputing conference. At this week’s SC23, in Denver, NVIDIA is sharing a new range of groundbreaking work in the field of accelerated computing. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/supercomputing/">View the full schedule</a> and catch the replay of NVIDIA&#8217;s special address below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Michael Kuehn and Davide Vodola are taking to new heights work that’s pioneering <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-quantum-computing/">quantum computing</a> for the world’s largest chemical company.</p>
<p>The BASF researchers are demonstrating how a quantum algorithm can see what no traditional simulation can — key attributes of NTA, a compound with applications that include removing toxic metals like iron from a city’s wastewater.</p>
<p>The quantum computing team at BASF simulated on GPUs how the equivalent of 24 qubits — the processing engines of a quantum computer — can tackle the challenge.</p>
<p>Many corporate R&amp;D centers would consider that a major achievement, but they pressed on, and recently ran their first 60 qubit simulations on NVIDIA’s Eos H100 Supercomputer.</p>
<p>“It’s the largest simulation of a molecule using a quantum algorithm we’ve ever run,” said Kuehn.</p>
<h2><b>Flexible, Friendly Software</b></h2>
<p>BASF is running the simulation on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-quantum">NVIDIA CUDA Quantum</a>, a platform for programming CPUs, GPUs and quantum computers, also known as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-qpu/">QPUs</a>.</p>
<p>Vodola described it as “very flexible and user friendly, letting us build up a complex quantum circuit simulation from relatively simple building blocks. Without CUDA Quantum, it would be impossible to run this simulation,” he said.</p>
<p>The work requires a lot of heavy lifting, too, so BASF turned to an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a> service that uses <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>.</p>
<p>“We need a lot of computing power, and the NVIDIA platform is significantly faster than CPU-based hardware for this kind of simulation,” said Kuehn.</p>
<p>BASF’s quantum computing initiative, which Kuehn helped launch, started in 2017. In addition to its work in chemistry, the team is developing use cases for quantum computing in machine learning as well as optimizations for logistics and scheduling.</p>
<h2><b>An Expanding CUDA Quantum Community</b></h2>
<p>Other research groups are also advancing science with CUDA Quantum.</p>
<p>At SUNY Stony Brook, researchers are pushing the boundaries of high-energy physics to simulate complex interactions of subatomic particles. Their work promises new discoveries in fundamental physics.</p>
<p>“CUDA Quantum enables us to do quantum simulations that would otherwise be impossible,” said Dmitri Kharzeev,  a SUNY professor and scientist at Brookhaven National Lab.</p>
<p>In addition, a research team at <a href="https://community.hpe.com/t5/advancing-life-work/hpc-for-simulating-quantum-circuits/ba-p/7200536">Hewlett Packard Labs</a> is using the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nersc-perlmutter-ai-supercomputer/">Perlmutter supercomputer</a> to explore magnetic phase transition in quantum chemistry in one of the largest simulations of its kind. The effort could reveal important and unknown details of physical processes too difficult to model with conventional techniques.</p>
<p>“As quantum computers progress toward useful applications, high-performance classical simulations will be key for prototyping novel quantum algorithms,” said Kirk Bresniker, a chief architect at Hewlett Packard Labs. “Simulating and learning from quantum data are promising avenues toward tapping quantum computing’s potential.”</p>
<h2><b>A Quantum Center for Healthcare</b></h2>
<p>These efforts come as support for CUDA Quantum expands worldwide.</p>
<p>Classiq — an Israeli startup that already has more than 400 universities using its novel approach to writing quantum programs — <a href="https://classiq.io/insights/classiq-announces-quantum-center-for-life-sciences-in-collaboration-with-nvidia">announced </a>today a new research center at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel’s largest teaching hospital.</p>
<p>Created in collaboration with NVIDIA, it will train experts in life science to write quantum applications that could someday help doctors diagnose diseases or accelerate the discovery of new drugs.</p>
<p>Classiq created quantum design software that automates low-level tasks, so developers don’t need to know all the complex details of how a quantum computer works. It’s now being integrated with CUDA Quantum.</p>
<p><a href="https://terraquantum.swiss/news/terra-quantum-nvidia-collaborate-to-unlock-unprecedented-business-performance-with-hybrid-quantum-computing">Terra Quantum</a>, a quantum services company with headquarters in Germany and Switzerland, is developing hybrid quantum applications for life sciences, energy, chemistry and finance that will run on CUDA Quantum. And IQM in Finland is enabling its superconducting QPU to use CUDA Quantum.</p>
<h2><b>Quantum Loves Grace Hopper</b></h2>
<p>Several companies, including Oxford Quantum Circuits, will use <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/">NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips</a> to power their hybrid quantum efforts. Based in Reading, England, Oxford Quantum is using Grace Hopper in a hybrid QPU/GPU system programmed by CUDA Quantum.</p>
<p>Quantum Machines announced that the Israeli National Quantum Center will be the first deployment of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-quantum/">NVIDIA DGX Quantum</a>, a system using Grace Hopper Superchips. Based in Tel Aviv, the center will tap DGX Quantum to power quantum computers from Quantware, ORCA Computing and more.</p>
<p>In addition, Grace Hopper is being put to work by qBraid, in Chicago, to build a quantum cloud service, and Fermioniq, in Amsterdam, to develop tensor-network algorithms.</p>
<p>The large quantity of shared memory and the memory bandwidth of Grace Hopper make these superchips an excellent fit for memory-hungry quantum simulations.</p>
<p>Get started programming hybrid quantum systems today with the latest release of CUDA Quantum from <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/cuda-quantum">NGC</a>, NVIDIA’s catalog of accelerated software, or <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum">GitHub</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Dozens of new supercomputers for scientific computing will soon hop online, powered by NVIDIA’s breakthrough GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip for giant-scale AI and high performance computing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA GH200</a> enables scientists and researchers to tackle the world’s most challenging problems by accelerating complex AI and HPC applications running terabytes of data.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/supercomputing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SC23</a> supercomputing show, NVIDIA today announced that the superchip is coming to more systems worldwide, including from Dell Technologies, Eviden, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Lenovo, QCT and Supermicro.</p>
<p>Bringing together the Arm-based <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Grace CPU</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/hopper-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopper GPU</a> architectures using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink-c2c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA NVLink-C2C</a> interconnect technology, GH200 also serves as the engine behind scientific supercomputing centers across the globe.</p>
<p>Combined, these GH200-powered centers represent some 200 <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-an-exaflop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exaflops</a> of AI performance to drive scientific innovation.</p>
<h2><b>HPE Cray Supercomputers Integrate NVIDIA Grace Hopper</b></h2>
<p>At the show in Denver, HPE announced it will offer HPE Cray EX2500 supercomputers with the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip. The integrated solution will feature quad GH200 processors, scaling up to tens of thousands of Grace Hopper Superchip nodes to provide organizations with unmatched supercomputing agility and quicker AI training. This configuration will also be part of a supercomputing solution for generative AI that HPE introduced today.</p>
<p>“Organizations are rapidly adopting generative AI to accelerate business transformations and technological breakthroughs,” said Justin Hotard, executive vice president and general manager of HPC, AI and Labs at HPE. “Working with NVIDIA, we’re excited to deliver a full supercomputing solution for generative AI, powered by technologies like Grace Hopper, which will make it easy for customers to accelerate large-scale AI model training and tuning at new levels of efficiency.”</p>
<h2><b>Next-Generation AI Supercomputing Centers</b></h2>
<p>A vast array of the world’s supercomputing centers are powered by NVIDIA Grace Hopper systems. Several top centers announced at SC23 that they’re now integrating GH200 systems for their supercomputers.</p>
<p>Germany’s Jülich Supercomputing Centre will use GH200 superchips in JUPITER, set to become the first exascale supercomputer in Europe. The supercomputer will help tackle urgent scientific challenges, such as mitigating climate change, combating pandemics and bolstering sustainable energy production.</p>
<p>Japan’s Joint Center for Advanced High Performance Computing — established between the Center for Computational Sciences at the University of Tsukuba and the Information Technology Center at the University of Tokyo — promotes advanced computational sciences integrated with data analytics, AI and machine learning across academia and industry. Its next-generation supercomputer will be powered by NVIDIA Grace Hopper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Thanks to a viral trend sweeping social media, we now know some men think about the Roman Empire every day.</p>
<p>And thanks to Luke Farritor, a 21-year-old computer science undergrad at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and like-minded AI enthusiasts, there might soon be a lot more to think about.</p>
<p>Blending a passion for history with machine learning skills, Farritor has triumphed in the Vesuvius Challenge, wielding the power of the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 GPU to bring a snippet of ancient text back from the ashes after almost 2,000 years.</p>
<h2>Text Big Thing: Deciphering Rome’s Hidden History</h2>
<p>The Herculaneum scrolls are a library of ancient texts that were carbonized and preserved by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, which buried the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum under a thick layer of ash and pumice.</p>
<p>The competition, which has piqued the interest of historians and technologists across the globe, seeks to extract readable content from the carbonized remains of the scrolls.</p>
<p>In a significant breakthrough, the word “πορφυρας,” which means “purple dye” or “cloths of purple,” emerged from the ancient texts thanks to the efforts of Farritor.</p>
<figure id="attachment_35262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35262" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-35262 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll-672x448.jpg" alt="The Herculaneum scrolls, wound about 100 times around, are sealed by the heat of the lava." width="672" height="448" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll-672x448.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll-676x451.jpg 676w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll-328x219.jpg 328w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Herculaneum-scroll.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-35262" class="wp-caption-text">The Herculaneum scrolls, wound about 100 times around, are sealed by the heat of the eruption of Vesuvius.</figcaption></figure>
<p>His achievement in identifying 10 letters within a small patch of scroll earned him a $40,000 prize.</p>
<p>Close on his heels was Youssef Nader, a biorobotics graduate student, who independently discerned the same word a few months later, meriting a $10,000 prize.</p>
<p>Adding to these notable successes, Casey Handmer, an entrepreneur with a keen eye, secured another $10,000 for his demonstration that significant amounts of ink were waiting to be discovered within the unopened scrolls.</p>
<p>All these discoveries are advancing the work pioneered by W. Brent Seales, chair of the University of Kentucky Computer Science Department, who has dedicated over a decade to developing methods to digitally unfurl and read the delicate Herculaneum scrolls.</p>
<p>Turbocharging these efforts is Nat Friedman, the CEO of GitHub and the organizer of the Vesuvius Challenge, whose commitment to open-source innovation has fostered a community where such historical breakthroughs are possible.</p>
<p>To become the first to decipher text from the scrolls, Farritor, who served as an intern at SpaceX, harnessed the GeForce GTX 1070 to accelerate his work.</p>
<h2>When Rome Meets RAM: Older GPU Helps Uncover Even Older Text</h2>
<p>Introduced in 2016, the GTX 1070 is celebrated among gamers, who have long praised the GPU for its balance of performance and affordability.</p>
<p>Instead of gaming, however, Farritor harnessed the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU to accelerate the ResNet deep learning framework, processing data at speeds unattainable by traditional computing methods.</p>
<p>Farritor is not the only competitor harnessing NVIDIA GPUs, which have proven themselves as indispensable tools to Vesuvius challenge competitors.</p>
<h2>Latin Lingo and Lost Text</h2>
<p>Discovered in the 18th century in the Villa of the Papyri, the Herculaneum scrolls have presented a challenge to researchers. Their fragile state has made them nearly impossible to read without causing damage. The advent of advanced imaging and AI technology changed that.</p>
<p>The project has become a passion for Farritor, who finds himself struggling to recall more of the Latin he studied in high school. “And man, like what’s in the scrolls &#8230; it’s just the anticipation, you know?” Farritor said.</p>
<p>The next challenge is to unearth passages from the Herculaneum scrolls that are 144 characters long, echoing the brevity of an original Twitter post.</p>
<p>Engaging over 1,500 experts in a collaborative effort, the endeavor is now more heated than ever.</p>
<p>Private donors have upped the ante, offering a $700,000 prize for those who can retrieve four distinct passages of at least 140 characters this year — a testament to the value placed on these ancient texts and the lengths required to reclaim them.</p>
<p>And Farritor’s eager to keep digging, reeling off the names of lost works of Roman and Greek history that he’d love to help uncover.</p>
<p>He reports he’s now thinking about Rome — and what his efforts might help discover — not just every day now, but “every hour.” “I think anything that sheds light on that time in human history is gonna be significant,” Farritor said.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67961" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-672x422.jpg" alt="NVIDIA H100 training results over time on MLPerf benchmarks" width="672" height="422" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-672x422.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-400x251.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-768x483.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-716x450.jpg 716w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-342x215.jpg 342w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights-159x100.jpg 159w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-NV-H100-Leaps-to-New-Heights.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>The benchmark uses a portion of the full GPT-3 data set behind the popular ChatGPT service that, by extrapolation, Eos could now train in just eight days, 73x faster than a prior state-of-the-art system using 512 A100 GPUs.</p>
<p>The acceleration in training time reduces costs, saves energy and speeds time-to-market. It’s heavy lifting that makes large language models widely available so every business can adopt them with tools like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, a framework for customizing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">LLMs</a>.</p>
<p>In a new generative AI test ‌this round, 1,024 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/hopper-architecture/">NVIDIA Hopper architecture GPUs</a> completed a training benchmark based on the Stable Diffusion text-to-image model in 2.5 minutes, setting a high bar on this new workload.</p>
<p>By adopting these two tests, MLPerf reinforces its leadership as the industry standard for measuring AI performance, since generative AI is the most transformative technology of our time.</p>
<h2><b>System Scaling Soars</b></h2>
<p>The latest results were due in part to the use of the most accelerators ever applied to an MLPerf benchmark. The 10,752 H100 GPUs far surpassed the scaling in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-debut-mlperf/">AI training</a> in June, when NVIDIA used 3,584 Hopper GPUs.</p>
<p>The 3x scaling in GPU numbers delivered a 2.8x scaling in performance, a 93% efficiency rate thanks in part to software optimizations.</p>
<p>Efficient scaling is a key requirement in generative AI because LLMs are growing by <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/huangs-law-dally-hot-chips/">an order of magnitude every year</a>. The latest results show NVIDIA’s ability to meet this unprecedented challenge for even the world’s largest data centers.</p>

<p>The achievement is thanks to a full-stack platform of innovations in accelerators, systems and software that both Eos and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nd-h100-v5-series">Microsoft Azure</a> used in the latest round.</p>
<p>Eos and Azure both employed 10,752 H100 GPUs in separate submissions. They achieved within 2% of the same performance, demonstrating the efficiency of NVIDIA AI in data center and public-cloud deployments.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67967" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-672x378.jpg" alt="Chart of record Azure scaling in MLPerf training" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-800x450.jpg 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-382x215.jpg 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-Azure-achieves-record-scaling.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>NVIDIA relies on Eos for a wide array of critical jobs. It helps advance initiatives like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS</a>, AI-powered software for state-of-the-art computer graphics and NVIDIA Research projects like <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/llm-semiconductors-chip-nemo/">ChipNeMo</a>, generative AI tools that help design next-generation GPUs.</p>
<h2><b>Advances Across Workloads</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA set several new records in this round in addition to making advances in generative AI.</p>
<p>For example, H100 GPUs were 1.6x faster than the prior-round training recommender models widely employed to help users find what they’re looking for online. Performance was up 1.8x on RetinaNet, a computer vision model.</p>
<p>These increases came from a combination of advances in software and scaled-up hardware.</p>
<p>NVIDIA was once again the only company to run all MLPerf tests. H100 GPUs demonstrated the fastest performance and the greatest scaling in each of the nine benchmarks.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67970" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-672x366.jpg" alt="List of six new NVIDIA records in MLPerf training" width="672" height="366" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-672x366.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-400x218.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-768x418.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-826x450.jpg 826w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-395x215.jpg 395w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-184x100.jpg 184w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training-1280x697.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-Six-NVIDIA-records-in-MLPerf-training.jpg 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>Speedups translate to faster time to market, lower costs and energy savings for users training massive LLMs or customizing them with frameworks like NeMo for the specific needs of their business.</p>
<p>Eleven systems makers used the NVIDIA AI platform in their submissions this round, including ASUS, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Lenovo, QCT and Supermicro.</p>
<p>NVIDIA partners participate in MLPerf because they know it’s a valuable tool for customers evaluating AI platforms and vendors.</p>
<h2><b>HPC Benchmarks Expand</b></h2>
<p>In MLPerf HPC, a separate benchmark for AI-assisted simulations on supercomputers, H100 GPUs delivered up to twice the performance of NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/mlperf-hpc-ai/">the last HPC round</a>. The results showed up to 16x gains since the first MLPerf HPC round in 2019.</p>
<p>The benchmark included a new test that trains OpenFold, a model that predicts the 3D structure of a protein from its sequence of amino acids. OpenFold can do in minutes vital work for healthcare that used to take researchers weeks or months.</p>
<p>Understanding a protein’s structure is key to finding effective drugs fast because most drugs act on proteins, the cellular machinery that helps control many biological processes.</p>
<p>In the MLPerf HPC test, H100 GPUs trained OpenFold in 7.5 minutes.  The OpenFold test is a representative part of the entire AlphaFold training process that two years ago took 11 days using 128 accelerators.</p>
<p>A version of the OpenFold model and the software NVIDIA used to train it will be available soon in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a>, a generative AI platform for drug discovery.</p>
<p>Several partners made submissions on the NVIDIA AI platform in this round. They included Dell Technologies and supercomputing centers at Clemson University, the Texas Advanced Computing Center and — with assistance from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) — Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</p>
<h2><b>Benchmarks With Broad Backing</b></h2>
<p>Since its inception in May 2018, the MLPerf benchmarks have enjoyed broad backing from both industry and academia. Organizations that support them include Amazon, Arm, Baidu, Google, Harvard, HPE, Intel, Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Stanford University and the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>MLPerf tests are transparent and objective, so users can rely on the results to make informed buying decisions.</p>
<p>All the software NVIDIA used is available from the MLPerf repository, so all developers can get the same world-class results. These software optimizations get continuously folded into containers available on <a href="https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog">NGC</a>, NVIDIA’s software hub for GPU applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Clinician-led healthcare AI company <a href="https://harrison.ai/">Harrison.ai</a> has built an AI system that effectively serves as a “spell checker” for radiologists — flagging critical findings to improve the speed and accuracy of radiology image analysis, reducing misdiagnoses.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of NVIDIA’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/ai-podcast/">AI Podcast</a>, host Noah Kravitz spoke with Harrison.ai cofounder and CEO Aengus Tran about the company’s mission to scale global healthcare capacity with autonomous AI systems.</p>
<p>Harrison.ai’s initial product, Annalise.ai, is an AI tool that automates radiology image analysis to enable faster, more accurate diagnoses. It can produce 124-130 different possible diagnoses and flag key findings to aid radiologists in their final diagnosis. Currently, Annalise.ai works for chest X-rays and brain CT scans, with more on the way.</p>

<p>While an AI designed for categorizing traffic lights, for example, doesn’t need perfection, medical tools must be highly accurate — any oversight could be fatal. To overcome this challenge, annalise.ai was trained on millions of meticulously annotated images — some were annotated three to five times over before being used for training.</p>
<p>Harrison.ai is also developing Franklin.ai, a sibling AI tool aimed at accelerating and improving the accuracy of histopathology diagnosis — in which a clinician performs a biopsy and inspects the tissue for the presence of cancerous cells. Similarly to Annalise.ai, Franklin.ai flags critical findings to assist pathologists in speeding and increasing the accuracy of diagnoses.</p>
<p>Ethical concerns about AI use are ever rising, but for Tran, the concern is less about whether it’s ethical to use AI for medical diagnosis but “actually the converse: Is it ethical to <i>not</i> use AI for medical diagnosis,” especially if “humans using those AI systems simply pick up more misdiagnosis, pick up more cancer and conditions?”</p>
<p>Tran also talked about the future of AI systems and suggested that the focus is dual: first, focus on improving preexisting systems and then think of new cutting-edge solutions.</p>
<p>And for those looking to break into careers in AI and healthcare, Tran says that the “first step is to decide upfront what problems you’re willing to spend a huge part of your time solving first, before the AI part,” emphasizing that the “first thing is actually to fall in love with some problem.”</p>

<p>Taiwanese artist Steven Tung creates captivating 2D and 3D digital art that explores sci-fi, minimalism and realism and pushes artistic boundaries.</p>
<p>This week <i>In the NVIDIA Studio,</i> Tung shares the inspiration and creative workflow behind his whimsical animation, <i>The Given Fish</i>.</p>
<p>Professional-grade technology, which was once available only at select special effects studios, is becoming increasingly accessible.</p>
<p>“Visual production capabilities continue to skyrocket, generating a growing demand for better computer hardware among the general public,” Tung said. “The evolving synergy between art and technology can spark endless possibilities for creators.”</p>
<p>Tung uses an <a href="https://www.msi.com/Desktop/MEG-Trident-X2-13th">MSI MEG Trident X2 desktop</a>, powered by GeForce RTX 4090 graphics, to accelerate his creative workflow.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67876" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67876" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67876" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67876" class="wp-caption-text">The MSI MEG Trident X2 desktop, powered by GeForce RTX 4090 graphics.</figcaption></figure>
<p>“The enhanced speed and performance expedites various processes, such as updating material textures in Adobe Substance 3D Painter and rendering in Blender,” said Tung. “The necessary specifications and requirements align, enabling maximum creativity without limitations.”</p>
<h2><b>Exquisite Visuals Made E-fish-ciently</b></h2>
<p>Tung’s 3D animation, <i>The Given Fish</i>, may look simple at first glance — but it’s surprisingly complex.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>“GeForce RTX GPUs are indispensable hardware for 3D rendering tasks. Faster speeds bring significant benefits in production efficiency and time saved.” — Steven Tung</p>
</div>
<p>In the creative world behind the animation, the stone fish depicted can be consumed by people. The concept is that once taken out of the aquarium, the stone fish transforms into a real, living one.</p>
<p>“I have a strong desire to have an aquarium at home, but it’s not practical,” said Tung. “The next best thing is to turn that emotion into art.”</p>
<p>Tung began by creating concept sketches in Adobe Photoshop, where he had access to over 30 GPU-accelerated features that could help modify and adjust his canvas and maximize his efficiency.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67879" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67879" style="width: 453px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67879" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w-453x500.png" alt="" width="453" height="500" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w-453x500.png 453w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w-363x400.png 363w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w-768x847.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w-408x450.png 408w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w-195x215.png 195w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w-91x100.png 91w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-sketch-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67879" class="wp-caption-text">Concept art for “The Given Fish.”</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, Tung jumped from 2D to 3D with ZBrush. He first built a basic model and then refined critical details with custom brushes — adding greater depth and dimension with authentic, hand-sculpted textures.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67882" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67882" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67882" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-wip-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67882" class="wp-caption-text">Advanced sculpting in ZBrush.</figcaption></figure>
<p>He then used the UV unwrapping feature in RizomUV to ensure that his models were properly unwrapped and ready for texture application.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67885" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67885" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67885" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w-672x361.png" alt="" width="672" height="361" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w-672x361.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w-400x215.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w-768x412.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w-838x450.png 838w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w-401x215.png 401w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w-186x100.png 186w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-rizomuv-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67885" class="wp-caption-text">UV unwrapping feature in RizomUV.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Tung imported the models into Adobe 3D Substance Painter, where he meticulously painted textures, blended materials and used the built-in library to achieve lifelike stone textures. RTX-accelerated light and ambient occlusion baking optimized his assets in seconds.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67888" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67888" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67888" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-adobe-substance-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67888" class="wp-caption-text">Applying textures in Adobe Substance 3D Painter.</figcaption></figure>
<p>To bring all the elements together, Tung imported the models and materials into Blender. He set up texture channels, assigned texture files and assembled the models so that they would be true to the compositions outlined in the initial sketch.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67891" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67891" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67891" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-steven-tung-wk82-painting-fish-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67891" class="wp-caption-text">Achieving realistic stone textures in Adobe 3D Substance Painter.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, Tung used Blender Cycles to light and render the scene.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67894" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67894" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/comp-studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67894" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/comp-studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/comp-studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/comp-studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/comp-studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/comp-studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/comp-studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/comp-studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/comp-studio-steven-tung-wk82-kv-bg-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67894" class="wp-caption-text">Composition edits in Blender.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Blender Cycles’ RTX-accelerated, AI-powered OptiX ray tracing enabled interactive, photorealistic movement in the viewport and sped up animation work — all powered by his GeForce RTX 4090 GPU-equipped system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Embodying the convergence of AI and academia, the University of Florida Friday inaugurated the Malachowsky Hall for Data Science &amp; Information Technology.</p>
<p>The sleek, seven-story building is poised to play a pivotal role in UF’s ongoing efforts to harness the transformative power of AI, reaffirming its stature as one of the nation’s leading public universities.</p>
<p>Evoking Apple co-founder Steve Jobs’ iconic description of a personal computer, NVIDIA’s founder and CEO Jensen Huang described Malachowsky Hall — named for NVIDIA co-founder Chris Malachowsky — and the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/university-of-florida-nvidia-ai-supercomputer/">HiPerGator AI supercomputer</a> it hosts as a “starship for knowledge discovery.”</p>
<p>“Steve Jobs called (the PC) ‘the bicycle of the mind,’ a device that propels our thoughts further and faster,” Huang said.</p>
<p>“What Chris Malachowsky has gifted this institution is nothing short of the ‘starship of the mind’ — a vehicle that promises to take our intellect to uncharted territories,” Huang said.</p>
<p>The inauguration of the 260,000-square-foot structure marks a milestone in the partnership between UF alum Malachowsky, NVIDIA and the state of Florida — a collaboration that has propelled UF to the forefront of AI innovation.</p>
<p>Malachowsky and NVIDIA both made major contributions toward its construction, bolstered by a $110 million investment from the state of Florida.</p>

<p>Following the opening, Huang and UF’s new president, Ben Sasse, met to discuss the impact of AI and data science across UF and beyond for students just starting their careers.</p>
<p>Sasse underscored the importance of adaptability in a rapidly changing world, telling the audience: “work in lots and lots of different organizations … because lifelong work in any one, not just firm, but any one industry is going to end in our lives. You’re ultimately going to have to figure out how to reinvent yourselves at 30, 35, 40 and 45.”</p>
<p>Huang offered students very different advice, recalling how he met his wife, Lori, who was in the audience, as an undergraduate. “Have a good pickup line … do you want to know the pickup line?” Huang asked, pausing a beat. “You want to see my homework?”</p>
<p>The spirit of Sasse and Huang’s adaptable approach to career and personal development is embodied in Malachowsky Hall, designed to bring together people from academia and industry, research and government.</p>
<p>Packed with innovative collaboration spaces and labs, the hall features a spacious 400-seat auditorium, dedicated high-performance computing study spaces and a rooftop terrace that unveils panoramic campus vistas.</p>
<p>Sustainability is woven into its design, highlighted by energy-efficient systems and rainwater harvesting facilities.</p>
<p>Malachowsky Hall will serve as a conduit to bring the on-campus advances in AI to Florida’s thriving economy, which continues to outpace the nation in jobs and GDP growth.</p>

<p>UF’s efforts to bring AI and academia together, catalyzed by support from Malachowsky and NVIDIA, go far beyond Malachowsky Hall.</p>
<p>In 2020, UF announced that Malachowsky and NVIDIA together donated $50 million toward HiPerGator, one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the country.</p>
<p>With additional state support, UF recently added more than 110 AI faculty members to the 300 already engaged in AI teaching and research.</p>
<p>As a result, UF extended AI-focused courses, workshops and projects across the university, enabling its 55,000 students to delve into AI and its interdisciplinary applications.</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s ribbon-cutting will open exciting new opportunities for the university, its students and the state of Florida to realize the potential of AI innovations across sectors.</p>
<p>Huang likened pursuing knowledge through AI to embarking on a “starship.” “You’ve got to go as far as you can,” he urged students.</p>
