										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA today launched a cloud service for medical imaging AI to further streamline and accelerate the creation of ground-truth data and training of specialized AI models through fully managed, cloud-based application programming interfaces.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/monai/">NVIDIA MONAI</a> cloud APIs — announced at the annual meeting of RSNA, the Radiological Society of North America, taking place this week in Chicago — provide an expedited path for developers and platform providers to integrate AI into their medical imaging offerings using pretrained foundation models and AI workflows for enterprises. The APIs are built on the open-source MONAI project founded by NVIDIA and King’s College London.</p>
<p>Medical imaging is critical across healthcare, making up approximately <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09104.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90% of healthcare data</a>. It’s used by radiologists and clinicians to do screening, diagnosis and intervention, by biopharma researchers to evaluate how clinical trial patients respond to new drugs and by medical device makers to provide real-time decision support.</p>
<p>The scale of work across each of these areas requires a medical imaging-specific AI factory — an enterprise-grade platform that delivers large-scale data management, creates ground-truth annotations, accelerates model development and establishes seamless AI application deployment.</p>
<p>With NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs, solution providers can more easily integrate AI into their medical imaging platforms, enabling them to provide supercharged tools for radiologists, researchers and clinical trial teams to build domain-specialized AI factories. The APIs are <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-monai-cloud-api-early-access-program">available in early access</a> through the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a> AI supercomputing service.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA MONAI cloud API is integrated into Flywheel, a leading medical imaging data and AI platform that supports end-to-end workflows for AI development. Developers at medical image annotation companies including <a href="https://redbrickai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RedBrick AI</a> and at machine learning operations (MLOps) platform providers including <a href="https://www.dataiku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dataiku</a> are poised to integrate NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs into their offerings.</p>
<h2><b>Easy-to-Deploy Annotation and Training for Medical Imaging</b></h2>
<p>Building efficient and cost-effective AI solutions requires a robust, domain-specialized development foundation that includes full-stack optimizations for software, scalable multi-node systems and state-of-the-art research. It also requires high-quality ground-truth data — which can be arduous and time-consuming to gather, particularly for 3D medical images that require a high level of expertise to annotate.</p>
<p>NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs feature interactive annotation powered by the VISTA-3D (Vision Imaging Segmentation and Annotation) foundation model. It’s purpose-built for continuous learning, a capability that improves AI model performance based on user feedback and new data.</p>
<p>Trained on a dataset of annotated images from 3D CT scans from more than 4,000 patients, spanning various diseases and parts of the body, VISTA-3D accelerates the creation of 3D segmentation masks for medical image analysis. With continuous learning, the AI model’s annotation quality improves over time.</p>
<p>To further accelerate AI training, this release includes APIs that make it seamless to build custom models based on MONAI pretrained models. NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs also include Auto3DSeg, which automates hyperparameter tuning and AI model selection for a given 3D segmentation task, simplifying the model development process.</p>
<p>NVIDIA researchers recently won four challenges at the MICCAI medical imaging conference using Auto3DSeg. These included AI models to analyze 3D CT scans of the kidneys and heart, brain MRIs and 3D ultrasounds of the heart.</p>
<h2><b>Solutions Providers, Platform Builders Embrace NVIDIA MONAI Cloud APIs</b></h2>
<p>Medical imaging solution providers and machine learning platforms are using NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs to deliver critically valuable AI insights to accelerate their customers’ work.</p>
<p>Flywheel has integrated MONAI through <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> and is now offering NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs to accelerate medical image curation, labeling analysis and training. The Minneapolis-based company’s centralized, cloud-based platform powers biopharma companies, life science organizations, healthcare providers and academic medical centers to identify, curate and train medical imaging data for the development of trustworthy AI.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs lower the cost of building high-quality AI models for radiology, disease research and the evaluation of clinical trial data,” said Dan Marcus, chief scientific officer at Flywheel. “With the addition of cloud APIs for interactive annotation and automated segmentation, customers of our medical imaging AI platform can accelerate AI model development to more quickly deliver innovative solutions.”</p>
<p>Annotation and viewer solution providers, including Redbrick AI, <a href="https://radicalimaging.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radical Imaging</a>, <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">V7 Labs</a> and <a href="https://centaurlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centaur Labs</a>, will also use NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs to bring AI-assisted annotation and training capabilities to market faster, without having to host and manage the AI infrastructure on their own.</p>
<p>RedBrick AI is integrating the VISTA-3D model available through NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs to deliver interactive cloud annotation for its medical device customers that support distributed teams of clinicians.</p>
<p>“VISTA-3D allows our clients to rapidly build models across different modalities and conditions,” said Shivam Sharma, CEO of RedBrick AI. “The foundation model is generalizable, making it easy to fine-tune for various clinical applications with accurate, reliable segmentation results.”</p>
<p>To streamline enterprise AI model development, MLOps platform builders including Dataiku, ClearML and Weight &amp; Biases are also investigating the use of NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs.</p>
<p>Dataiku plans to integrate NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs to further simplify AI model creation for medical imaging applications.</p>
<p>“With NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs, Dataiku users would be able to easily use Auto3DSeg, a low-code option to accelerate the development of state-of-the-art segmentation models, through Dataiku’s web interface connected to an NVIDIA-hosted, GPU-accelerated service,” said Kelci Miclaus, global head of AI health and life sciences solutions at Dataiku. “This democratizes AI in biomedical imaging by extending the power to create and apply AI-driven workflows to both data and domain experts.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>A calendar packed with meetings, calls and lab visits may sound like a typical workday for many — but for Luca Lofranco, whose greatest wish was to experience what it’s like to work at NVIDIA, it was a dream come true.</p>
<p>Eighteen-year-old Lofranco recently traveled from his hometown near Toronto, Canada, to spend the day at our Santa Clara campus, supported by Make-A-Wish, a nonprofit that grants life-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses. The wish from Lofranco, who has Hodgkin’s lymphoma, was the fifth NVIDIA has been a part of in the last decade.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA team kept the day’s agenda a secret — surprising Lofranco with tours of the demo room and robotics lab, a chat with the University Recruiting team, a ride in a self-driving car and a video call with NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. An aspiring computer science major, Lofranco was stoked for it all because, as his mom Cassandra shared, “NVIDIA is his Disneyland.”</p>

<h2><b>A Long-Time NVIDIA Fan </b></h2>
<p>After attending his first computer science summer camp when he was eight, Lofranco learned 3D modeling in Autodesk Maya, programming in Python, as well as 3D printing. His budding interest in tech grew and, soon enough, he was building his own gaming rigs.</p>
<p>NVIDIA quickly became Lofranco’s favorite tech company, he said, so much so that he carved the company logo out of a piece of wood using a computer numerical control machine.</p>
<p>For gaming, he enjoys using NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 and GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPUs. But Lofranco’s ultimate draw to NVIDIA wasn’t its products but its culture.</p>
<p>“Everyone is driven to see the same outcome and comes together to make it happen,” he said. “Everything is designed for collaboration.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_68324" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68324" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-68324 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-672x409.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="409" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-672x409.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-400x244.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-768x468.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-1536x935.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-739x450.jpg 739w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-353x215.jpg 353w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-164x100.jpg 164w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca_crop1-1280x779.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68324" class="wp-caption-text">Lofranco in NVIDIA gear</figcaption></figure>
<h2><b>A VIP Experience</b></h2>
<p>Ahead of Lofranco’s visit, the NVIDIA team sent him a box of swag — including a hoodie, a hat and a custom NVIDIA badge.</p>
<p>Once he arrived on campus, NVIDIA volunteers welcomed and whisked Lofranco off on a campus tour, followed by a meeting with the solutions architect team, which includes NVIDIANs focused on healthcare, auto, AI, cloud service providers and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/">large language models</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68327 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-667x500.jpg" alt="" width="667" height="500" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-667x500.jpg 667w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-400x300.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-600x450.jpg 600w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-287x215.jpg 287w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-133x100.jpg 133w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NVIDIA_swag-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p>Next, a visit to the robotics lab helped satisfy Lofranco’s “maker” curiosity. He saw an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/data-center/dgx-platform/">NVIDIA DGX Station</a> as well as test robots for developing the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a> edge AI platform, and was soon directing a robot arm to stack colored blocks.</p>
<p>After learning that Lofranco’s favorite foods include lobster, tiramisu and Kit Kat candy bars, the café team prepared a special menu for him and all employees in the office that day. Everyone enjoyed a lobster roll pop-up station in the campus park and tiramisu-flavored ice cream with assorted toppings, including Kit Kat pieces.</p>

<h2><b>Innovators</b></h2>
<p>On a visit to the demo room at NVIDIA’s Santa Clara site, Lofranco and his father revealed that they tinker with innovations themselves. They programmed their water heater in the family hot tub to maintain a comfortable temperature and decrease the time needed to warm it — all thanks to Python code and Raspberry Pi experimentation.</p>
<p>With so much to soak in, Lofranco described his wish day at NVIDIA as “unfathomable” — and that was before his video call with Huang, which stretched from a planned quarter hour to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>After a conversation that spanned NVIDIA’s origins, many near failures and innovation, Huang gifted Lofranco a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/">GeForce RTX 4090</a> Founders Edition GPU and shared some sound advice: “Keep playing video games — but make sure to prioritize your homework.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_68333" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68333" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-68333 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-672x448.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="448" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-672x448.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-400x267.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-675x450.jpg 675w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-322x215.jpg 322w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC08733-1280x854.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68333" class="wp-caption-text">Lofranco with the surprise gift from Huang following their chat</figcaption></figure>
<p>Capping a packed day of fun-filled support from nearly 50 NVIDIANs was a visit to the auto lab and a spin in one of NVIDIA’s self-driving test cars.</p>
<p>How was it all? “Breathtaking,” said Lofranco, who learned firsthand from Huang that while NVIDIA has evolved from being the underdog to a leading tech company, it still feels “like a family.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Talk about going after low-hanging fruit. Afresh is an AI startup that helps grocery stores and retailers reduce food waste by making supply chains more efficient.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of NVIDIA’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/ai-podcast/">AI Podcast</a>, host Noah Kravitz spoke with the company’s cofounder and president, Nathan Fenner, about its mission, offerings and the greater challenge of eliminating food waste.</p>
<p>Most supply chain and inventory management offerings targeting grocers and retailers are outdated. Fenner and his team noticed those solutions, built for the nonperishable side of the business, didn’t work as well on the fresh side — creating enormous amounts of food waste and causing billions in lost profits.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1671268662%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-75QpZNVnAWT&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc; line-break: anywhere; word-break: normal; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif; font-weight: 100;"><a style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" title="The AI Podcast" href="https://soundcloud.com/theaipodcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The AI Podcast</a> · <a style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" title="AI-Powered Tech Company Helps Grocers Start Afresh in Supply Chain Management" href="https://soundcloud.com/theaipodcast/nathan-fenner-afresh/s-75QpZNVnAWT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI-Powered Tech Company Helps Grocers Start Afresh in Supply Chain Management</a></div>
<p>The team first sought to solve the store-replenishment challenge by developing a platform to help grocers decide how much fresh produce to order to optimize costs while meeting demand.</p>
<p>They created machine learning and AI models that could effectively use the data generated by fresh produce, which is messier than data generated by nonperishable goods because of factors like time to decay, greater demand fluctuation and unreliability caused by lack of barcodes, leading to incorrect scans at self-checkout registers.</p>
<p>The result was a fully integrated, machine learning-based platform that helps grocers make informed decisions at each node of the operations process.</p>
<p>The company also recently launched inventory management software that allows grocers to save time and increase data accuracy by intelligently tracking inventory. That information can be inputted back into the platform’s ordering solution, further refining the accuracy of inventory data.</p>
<p>It’s all part of Afresh’s greater mission to tackle climate change.</p>
<p>“The most impactful thing we can do is reduce food waste to mitigate climate change,” Fenner said. “It’s really one of the key things that brought me into the business: I think I’ve always had a keen eye to work in the climate space. It’s really motivating for a lot of our team, and it’s a key part of our mission.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, is pioneering the use of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> to discover and develop new therapeutics and deliver treatments to patients more efficiently.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/15010/2023-11-21/genentech-and-nvidia-enter-into-strategi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration between Genentech</a>, the biotechnology pioneer, and NVIDIA aims to transform the discovery and development of new medicines by bringing together experts from each company to optimize and accelerate Genentech’s proprietary algorithms.</p>
<p>NVIDIA will work with Genentech to accelerate these models on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a>, which provides dedicated instances of AI supercomputing and software hosted by NVIDIA cloud service provider partners.</p>
<p>Genentech plans to use <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/bionemo/">NVIDIA BioNeMo</a>, which enables biotech companies to customize models at scale, and integrate BioNeMo cloud application programming interfaces directly into computational drug discovery workflows.</p>
<p>BioNeMo, now generally available as a training service, is a domain-specific platform that simplifies, accelerates and scales generative AI applications for computational drug discovery. It allows researchers to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-pretrained-ai-model/">pretrain</a> or fine-tune state-of-the-art models on DGX Cloud.</p>
<p>The collaboration will initially focus on optimizing Genentech’s drug discovery AI models in its “lab in a loop” framework. The goal: To allow its researchers to understand complex biomolecular patterns and relationships to truly disrupt drug development and improve the success rate of R&amp;D, and to empower scientists to deliver multiplicative, rather than linear or additive, benefits for patients and the broader healthcare ecosystem.</p>
<p>“Our collaboration with NVIDIA builds on our long history of successfully inventing and deploying technology in ways that were not initially apparent to others,” said Aviv Regev, executive vice president and head of Genentech Research &amp; Early Development (gRED). “We were the first biotech company to leverage molecular biology for drug discovery and development, which changed the world. We pioneered antibody therapeutics that became the paradigm of treatment. And now, we have brought AI, the lab and the clinic together to uncover otherwise inaccessible patterns in vast quantities of data, and to design experiments to test those patterns. Collaborating with NVIDIA, and introducing generative AI, has the power to turbocharge the discovery and design of therapeutics that will improve the lives of patients across the world.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Genentech and NVIDIA Revolutionize Drug Discovery with Generative AI in Lab in the Loop" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ijg2g8AsjE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Streamlining Drug Discovery With Computation  </b></h2>
<p>Drug discovery and development is currently a lengthy, complicated and costly process. Drug targets for novel medicines are difficult to predict, as is successfully developing a molecule as a potential therapeutic. AI can play a transformational role because generative and other AI models can help scientists rapidly identify potential drug molecules and interactions by training on large-scale datasets.</p>
<p>For Genentech, using AI helps bridge the gap between lab experiments and computational algorithms.</p>
<p>The company’s R&amp;D group, gRED, has already done significant work using AI — across multiple modalities — to discover and develop novel therapeutics while learning more about the building blocks of biology and diseases.</p>
<p>Teams from Genentech and NVIDIA will now work together to optimize Genentech’s custom-developed models to shorten this time-consuming process of drug discovery and development and lead to greater success.</p>
<h2><b>Putting AI in a Loop</b></h2>
<p>Genentech’s “lab in a loop” is an iterative framework for generating and exploring molecular designs with predicted properties. It aims to use experimental data to inform generative computational models and better optimize future molecular designs. NVIDIA will help Genentech optimize its framework by accelerating training and inference of Genentech’s drug discovery models.</p>
<p>Through this collaboration, NVIDIA AI experts will gain insights into AI-related challenges in drug discovery and development. NVIDIA plans to use these insights to improve its BioNeMo platform and others to further accommodate the requirements of models used by the biotech industry.</p>
<p>“AI can play a transformational role in accelerating drug discovery and development — as it has across many parts of healthcare and life sciences,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. “Together, NVIDIA and Genentech are unlocking scientific innovation by developing and implementing AI models and algorithms that enable us to rapidly iterate and unearth insights.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of our weekly </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/in-the-nvidia-studio/"><i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/"><i>NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> technology improves creative workflows. </i></p>
<p>It’s the season of gratitude: that time of year to give thanks for the people and small moments that make life so special.</p>
<p>This week’s featured <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i> artist, Ravissen Carpenen, is serving up a feast of mouthwateringly photorealistic 3D food renders to the dinner table.</p>
<p>His delectable time-lapse videos are featured on his YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Vs9hDHCD1pD85uCehjlAg">CG Realism</a> — presented with a side of upbeat music and a pinch of style.</p>
<p>Carpenen was one of several contributors to the food-themed Studio Standout video contest, alongside Roger Roque (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbFhGU0p5aEVnT2VHSU5IaHhuWDB3YURySWhtQXxBQ3Jtc0tsT196Ui14MWhNeHpTTmRzX2pNTFRWdlRld1VOVDNVaTQzbTljUV9xV1lWWXZDcW5kMVctcC1wWW9PVkloNjVpMXBLTHloUHVIa1FIZzZvNmZPbkdXWV9YVVFBUXExYXBWNU5yS0Y0aUNCeWFKREw5RQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Frogerroqueid%2F&amp;v=P1BIBbjntsM">@rogerroqueid</a>), Nicole Morena (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbmtuWHZKam1CUHB1VUd3aHBBZzRwZnhRTHZrQXxBQ3Jtc0tuX1NHQ3ZwZGpVcVZiS1RfMjRzR3VBd3Z5OTZIWnJPOVVKcS1UWTBLUFBtcENxYmdURy1QcjUzNU92aEFlMTJlZExuNjJINzBOaDJsNXZOLVB6cWt3OGpjRlNaQUZ5eDZHSnVxQjVjbEJUeXp1N0RyWQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fnicky.blender%2F&amp;v=P1BIBbjntsM">@nicky.blender</a>), Heloise Cart (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0l4ajNyVDBqV0Fta0xOOGhmXzZyNXJaM204Z3xBQ3Jtc0tsdUl4ZW5pZEdNMTUtblhkdW5QcjZpOTZvQkszMGVDdWlGM3Jva2p1eTlERkw5V0p2VjJBREVaSkRJVS1DQ1dWZ1o5Z0JyM3NZbFotUUFnRV9iYjZqYlhXR29zX0F5b3VQUHhJdzdQM25WQ1M0S2EzSQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fisoheell%2F&amp;v=P1BIBbjntsM">@isoheell</a>) and Kris Theroin (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbnRlYnpmR2pIY0pXQXp4Q2hieERxZm90dldyUXxBQ3Jtc0ttODhUdFRJRkJUOUVxRzE5SHE4cGM4dTVRa1FCX1JhYktoaUp6NGxwdE55QWc0MEpyQUdzbVFIN2lMX215WEdacEZ3OUphRDVJSkdpMmNjZlNGT3JEMC12MGJwZ3lyR0ptSFFOUXVOQ016M2NCbHlBYw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fkristheorin%2F&amp;v=P1BIBbjntsM">@kristheorin</a>).</p>

<h2><b>All About That Baste</b></h2>
<p>Carpenen’s wife, a pastry chef, inspired his photorealistic, food-centered works.</p>
<p>“My aim, one day, is to be able to create ultra-realistic renders that will be used in film and movies,” he said.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Happy Meal - Blender Timelapse" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vwA5CaYVPQQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>His projects begin with online research and reference gathering, mainly on Pinterest and Behance, which he then compiles into mood boards using the stand-alone image tracking program PureRef.</p>
<p>Before any modeling takes place, Carpenen lights the scene — but without textures.</p>
<p>“This is to tell the story of the artwork, as light intends to give artwork an emotional flow, alongside as well as color and materials,” he said.</p>
<p>Carpenen initially sculpts his models in ZBrush using customizable brushes to shape, texture and paint his virtual clay in a real-time environment with instant feedback.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68261-1" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Turkey-Blender-Timelapse-video.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Turkey-Blender-Timelapse-video.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Turkey-Blender-Timelapse-video.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He then browses the Quixel Megascans library for models that can further add realism, such as garlic cloves and rosemary garnishes for his turkey project.</p>
<h2><b>Rare-in for More</b></h2>
<p>Carpenen uses Marmoset Toolbag’s ambient occlusion, curvature, normal and thickness features to bake the ZBrush meshes from high-poly to low-poly models as 32-bit textures.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Medium Cooked Steak - 3D Timelapse" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c2NOK9eDRDA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The process saves memory space, minimizing lag time while allowing greater flexibility in the modeling stage.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68271" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68271" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w-672x372.png" alt="" width="672" height="372" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w-672x372.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w-400x221.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w-768x425.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w-814x450.png 814w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w-389x215.png 389w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w-181x100.png 181w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-medium-cooked-steak-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68271" class="wp-caption-text">Bake ZBrush meshes from high-poly to low-poly models as 32-bit textures in Marmoset Toolbag.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Carpenen’s GeForce RTX 3070 GPU-powered system with RTX acceleration instantly optimized his meshes. RTX-accelerated ray tracing and OptiX AI-powered denoising also enabled smoother viewport movement.</p>
<h2><b>Baking a Berry Good Pie</b></h2>
<p>Once the renders are ready, Carpenen imports them into Adobe Substance 3D Painter to apply custom colors and textures.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Blackberry Pie - Blender Timelapse" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xPA6-ZW293Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>There, Carpenen uses RTX-accelerated light and ambient occlusion baking — though not in the oven — to optimize his assets, such as this berry pie, in mere seconds.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68261-2" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Blackberry-Pie-Blender-Timelapse-video.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Blackberry-Pie-Blender-Timelapse-video.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Blackberry-Pie-Blender-Timelapse-video.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also had the option to set up a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/ecosystem/">live link</a> connection between 3D Painter and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/creators/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a development platform for connecting and building <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)</a>-based tools and applications, via the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/usd-composer/">USD Composer foundation app</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Adobe Substance 3D Painter Connector Overview with Omniverse USD Composer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_XRN2qAWJN0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The connection would allow Carpenen’s texture work in Substance 3D Painter to directly translate to USD Composer — eliminating the need for numerous file imports, exports and reformatting.</p>
<h2><b>Donut Hole in One</b></h2>
<p>Carpenen uses Blender to bring his scenes together with advanced model sculpting, animations and further lighting refinement.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Donut Fever - Blender Timelapse" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LESrdWIZgv0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>RTX GPUs allow smoother movement in the viewport thanks to Blender Cycles’ RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing.</p>

<p>And for exporting final files, RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in Blender Cycles delivers the fastest final-frame render.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68280" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68280" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-ravissen-carpenen-wk84-raw-image-edit-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68280" class="wp-caption-text">It doesn’t get any sweeter than this.</figcaption></figure>
<h2><b>Thanks to AI, This Work Is Toast</b></h2>
<p>Carpenen uses Adobe Photoshop Lightroom to put the finishing touches on his food scenes.</p>
<p>GPU-accelerated image processing enables dramatically more responsive adjustments on his 4K-resolution display.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Blender 2.92 - Toasty Morning" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHmrGJhm8-4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Carpenen had even more RTX-accelerated AI tools at his disposal in Lightroom. The “Raw Details” feature refines the fine color details of high-resolution RAW images. And “Super Resolution” uses AI to upscale images with higher quality than traditional methods.</p>
<p>According to Carpenen, putting in the work is key.</p>
<p>“It’s equivalent to practicing football — if you don’t get enough time daily to practice, you can’t hone skills,” he said. “It’s important to know how to tackle obstacles — and that knowledge can only be gained by experience.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>European startups will get a massive boost from a new generation of AI infrastructure, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said Friday in a fireside chat with iliad Group Deputy CEO Aude Durand — and it’s coming just in time.</p>
<p>“We’re now seeing a major second wave,” Huang said of the state of AI during a virtual appearance at Scaleway’s ai-PULSE conference in Paris for an audience of more than 1,000 in-person attendees.</p>
<p>Two elements are propelling this force, Huang explained in a conversation livestreamed from Station F, the world’s largest startup campus, which Huang joined via video conference from NVIDIA’s headquarters in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>First, “a recognition that every region and every country needs to build their sovereign AI,” Huang said. Second, the “adoption of AI in different industries,” as generative AI spreads throughout the world, Huang explained.</p>
<p>“So the types of breakthroughs that we’re seeing in language I fully expect to see in digital biology and manufacturing and robotics,” Huang said, noting this could create big opportunities for Europe with its rich digital biology and healthcare industries. “And of course, Europe is also home of some of the largest industrial manufacturing companies.”</p>
<h2><b>Praise for France’s AI Leadership</b></h2>
<p>Durand kicked off the conversation by asking Huang about his views on the European AI ecosystem, especially in France, where the government has invested millions of euros in AI research and development.</p>
<p>“Europe has always been rich in AI expertise,” Huang said, noting that NVIDIA works with 4,000 startups in Europe, more than 400 of them in France alone, pointing to Mistral, Qubit Pharmaceuticals and Poolside AI.</p>
<p>“At the same time, you have to really get the computing infrastructure going,” Huang said. “And this is the reason why Scaleway is so important to the advancement of AI in France” and throughout Europe, Huang said.</p>
<p>Highlighting the critical role of data in AI’s regional growth, Huang noted companies’ increasing awareness of the value of training AI with region-specific data. AI systems need to reflect the unique cultural and industrial nuances of each region, an approach gaining traction across Europe and beyond.</p>
<h2>NVIDIA and Scaleway: Powering Europe’s AI Revolution</h2>
<p>Scaleway, a subsidiary of iliad Group, a major European telecoms player, is doing its part to kick-start that second wave in Europe, offering cloud credits for access to its AI supercomputer cluster, which packs 1,016 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>.</p>
<p>As a regional cloud service provider, Scaleway also provides sovereign infrastructure that ensures access and compliance with EU data protection laws, which is critical for businesses with a European footprint.</p>
<p>Regional members of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception program</a>, which provides development assistance to startups, will also be able to access <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/scaleway-european-startups-inception">NVIDIA AI Enterprise software on Scaleway Marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>The software includes the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a> framework and pretrained models for building LLMs, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rapids">NVIDIA RAPIDS</a> for accelerated data science and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a> and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-supercharges-large-language-model-inference-on-nvidia-h100-gpus/">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a> for boosting inference.</p>
<h2>Revolutionizing AI With Supercomputing Prowess</h2>
<p>Recapping a month packed with announcements, Huang explained how NVIDIA is rapidly advancing high performance computing and AI worldwide to provide the infrastructure needed to power this second wave.</p>
<p>These systems are, in effect,  “supercomputers,” Huang said, with AI systems now among the world’s most powerful.</p>
<p>They include Scaleway’s newly available <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/news/scaleway-releases-the-details-of-its-offering-based-on-nabuchodonosor-its-dedicated-ai-supercomputer-built-on-nvidia-dgx-h100-infrastructure/">Nabuchodonosor</a> supercomputer, or “Nabu,” an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD</a> with 127 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-h100/?ncid=pa-srch-goog-560181&amp;_bt=676835775117&amp;_bk=dgx%20h100&amp;_bm=p&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=154931763096&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0NPi36mVggMV80lHAR0zigLiEAAYASAAEgJCF_D_BwE">NVIDIA DGX H100</a> systems, which will help startups in France and across Europe scale up AI workloads.</p>
<p>“As you know the Scaleway system that we brought online, Nabu, is not your normal computer,” Huang said. “In every single way, it’s a supercomputer.”</p>
<p>Such systems are underpinning powerful new services.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-introduces-generative-ai-foundry-service-on-microsoft-azure-for-enterprises-and-startups-worldwide">NVIDIA announced an AI Foundry service</a> on Microsoft Azure, aimed at accelerating the development of customized generative AI applications.</p>
<p>Huang highlighted NVIDIA AI foundry’s appeal to a diverse user base, including established enterprises such as Amdocs, Getty Images, SAP and ServiceNow.</p>
<p><a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-grace-hopper-superchip-powers-jupiter-defining-a-new-class-of-supercomputers-to-propel-ai-for-scientific-discovery">Huang noted that JUPITER, to be hosted at the Jülich facility, in Germany</a>, and poised to be Europe’s premier exascale AI supercomputer, will run on 24,000 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips, offering unparalleled computational capacity for diverse AI tasks and simulations.</p>
<p>Huang touched on NVIDIA’s just-announced HGX H200 AI computing platform, built on NVIDIA’s Hopper architecture and featuring the H200 Tensor Core GPU. Set for release in Q2 of 2024, it promises to redefine industry standards.</p>
<p>He also detailed NVIDIA’s strategy to develop ‘AI factories,’ advanced data centers that power diverse applications across industries, including electric vehicles, robotics, and generative AI services.</p>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>Finally, Durand asked Huang about the role of open source and open science in AI.</p>
<p>Huang said he’s a “huge fan” of open source. “Let’s acknowledge that without open source, how would AI have made the tremendous progress it has over the last decade,” Huang said.</p>
<p>“And so the ability for open source to energize the vibrancy and pull in the research and pull in the engagement of every startup, every researcher, every industry is really quite vital,” Huang said. “And you’re seeing it play out just presently, now going forward.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>How do you train an AI to understand clinical language with less clinical data? Train another AI to synthesize training data.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is changing the way medicine is done, and is increasingly being used in all sorts of clinical tasks.</p>
<p>This is fueled by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> and models like GatorTronGPT, a generative language model trained on the University of Florida’s HiPerGator AI supercomputer and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-023-00958-w">detailed in a paper published in Nature Digital Medicine Thursday</a>.</p>
<p>GatorTronGPT joins a growing number of large language models (<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/">LLMs</a>) trained on clinical data. Researchers trained the model using the GPT-3 framework, also used by ChatGPT.</p>
<p>They used a massive corpus of 277 billion words for this purpose. The training corpora included 82 billion words from de-identified clinical notes and 195 billion words from various English texts.</p>
<p>But there’s a twist: The research team also used GatorTronGPT to generate a synthetic clinical text corpus with over 20 billion words of synthetic clinical text, with carefully prepared prompts. The synthetic clinical text focuses on clinical factors and reads just like real clinical notes written by doctors.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/">synthetic data</a> was then used to train a BERT-based model called GatorTron-S.</p>
<p>In a comparative evaluation, GatorTron-S exhibited remarkable performance on clinical natural language understanding tasks like clinical concept extraction and medical relation extraction, beating the records set by the original BERT-based model, GatorTron-OG, which was trained on the 82-billion-word clinical dataset.</p>
<p>More impressively, it was able to do so using less data.</p>
<p>Both GatorTron-OG and GatorTron-S models were trained on 560 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> running NVIDIA’s Megatron-LM package on the University of Florida’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/university-of-florida-rankings-ai/">HiPerGator supercomputer</a>. Technology from the Megatron LM framework used in the project has since been incorporated with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a> framework, which has been central to more recent work on GatorTronGPT.</p>
<p>Using synthetic data created by LLMs addresses several challenges. LLMs require vast amounts of data, and there’s a limited availability of quality medical data.</p>
<p>In addition, synthetic data allows for model training that complies with medical privacy regulations, such as HIPAA.</p>
<p>The work with GatorTronGPT is just the latest example of how LLMs — which exploded onto the scene last year with the rapid adoption of ChatGPT — can be tailored to assist in a growing number of fields.</p>
<p>It’s also an example of the advances made possible by new AI techniques powered by accelerated computing.</p>
<p>The GatorTronGPT effort is the latest result of an <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/university-of-florida-nvidia-ai-supercomputer/">ambitious collaboration</a> announced in 2020, when the University of Florida and NVIDIA unveiled plans to erect the world’s fastest AI supercomputer in academia.</p>
<p>This initiative was driven by a $50 million gift, a fusion of contributions from NVIDIA founder Chris Malachowsky and NVIDIA itself.</p>
<p>Using AI to train more AI is just one example of HiPerGator’s impact, with the supercomputer promising to power more innovations in medical sciences and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/uf-health-syngatortron-ai-synthetic-clinical-data/">across disciplines</a> throughout the University of Florida system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Human analysts can no longer effectively defend against the increasing speed and complexity of cybersecurity attacks. The amount of data is simply too large to screen manually.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">Generative AI</a>, the most transformative tool of our time, enables a kind of digital jiu jitsu. It lets companies shift the force of data that threatens to overwhelm them into a force that makes their defenses stronger.</p>
<p>Business leaders seem ready for the opportunity at hand. In a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/c-suite-study/ceo">recent survey</a>, CEOs said cybersecurity is one of their top three concerns, and they see generative AI as a lead technology that will deliver competitive advantages.</p>
<p>Generative AI brings both risks and benefits. An earlier blog outlined <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-security-steps/">six steps to start the process of securing enterprise AI</a>.</p>
<p>Here are three ways generative AI can bolster cybersecurity.</p>
<h2><b>Begin With Developers</b></h2>
<p>First, give developers a security copilot.</p>
<p>Everyone plays a role in security, but not everyone is a security expert. So, this is one of the most strategic places to begin.</p>
<p>The best place to start bolstering security is on the front end, where developers are writing software. An AI-powered assistant, trained as a security expert, can help them ensure their code follows best practices in security.</p>
<p>The AI software assistant can get smarter every day if it’s fed previously reviewed code. It can learn from prior work to help guide developers on best practices.</p>
<p>To give users a leg up, NVIDIA is creating a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/ai-workflows/generative-ai-chatbots/">workflow for building such co-pilots or chatbots</a>. This particular workflow uses components from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, a framework for building and customizing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">large language models</a>.</p>
<p>Whether users customize their own models or use a commercial service, a security assistant is just the first step in applying generative AI to cybersecurity.</p>
<h2><b>An Agent to Analyze Vulnerabilities</b></h2>
<p>Second, let generative AI help navigate the sea of known software vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>At any moment, companies must choose among thousands of patches to mitigate known exploits. That’s because every piece of code can have roots in dozens if not thousands of different software branches and open-source projects.</p>
<p>An LLM focused on vulnerability analysis can help prioritize which patches a company should implement first. It’s a particularly powerful security assistant because it reads all the software libraries a company uses as well as its policies on the features and APIs it supports.</p>
<p>To test this concept, NVIDIA built a pipeline to analyze software containers for vulnerabilities. The agent identified areas that needed patching with high accuracy, speeding the work of human analysts up to 4x.</p>
<p>The takeaway is clear. It’s time to enlist generative AI as a first responder in vulnerability analysis.</p>
<h2><b>Fill the Data Gap</b></h2>
<p>Finally, use LLMs to help fill the growing data gap in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Users rarely share information about data breaches because they’re so sensitive. That makes it difficult to anticipate exploits.</p>
<p>Enter LLMs. Generative AI models can create <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/">synthetic data</a> to simulate never-before-seen attack patterns. Such synthetic data can also fill gaps in training data so machine-learning systems learn how to defend against exploits before they happen.</p>
<h2><b>Staging Safe Simulations</b></h2>
<p>Don’t wait for attackers to demonstrate what’s possible. Create safe simulations to learn how they might try to penetrate corporate defenses.</p>
<p>This kind of proactive defense is the hallmark of a strong security program. Adversaries are already using generative AI in their attacks. It’s time users harness this powerful technology for cybersecurity defense.</p>
<p>To show what’s possible, another <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/ai-workflows/spear-phishing/">AI workflow</a> uses generative AI to defend against spear phishing — the carefully targeted bogus emails that cost companies an estimated $2.4 billion in 2021 alone.</p>
<p>This workflow generated synthetic emails to make sure it had plenty of good examples of spear phishing messages. The AI model trained on that data learned to understand the intent of incoming emails through natural language processing capabilities in <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/morpheus-cybersecurity">NVIDIA Morpheus</a>, a framework for AI-powered cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The resulting model caught 21% more spear phishing emails than existing tools. Check out our <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-and-accelerated-computing-for-spear-phishing-detection/">developer blog</a> or watch the video below to learn more.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Improve Spear Phishing Detection with Generative AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/57dEPP67XrY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Wherever users choose to start this work, automation is crucial, given the shortage of cybersecurity experts and the thousands upon thousands of users and use cases that companies need to protect.</p>
<p>These three tools — software assistants, virtual vulnerability analysts and synthetic data simulations — are great starting points for applying generative AI to a security journey that continues every day.</p>
<p>But this is just the beginning. Companies need to integrate generative AI into all layers of their defenses.</p>
<p>Attend a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/llm-developer-day/">webinar</a> for more details on how to get started.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[3D artists can improve the productivity and efficiency of their generative AI-enabled content-creation workflows thanks to the latest updates to popular OpenUSD software.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/news/"><i>Into the Omniverse</i></a><i>, a series focused on how artists, developers and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advances in </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>OpenUSD</i></a><i> and </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>NVIDIA Omniverse</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<p>In 3D art and design, efficient workflows are essential for quickly bringing creative visions to life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description</a>, aka OpenUSD, is a framework that enhances these workflows by providing a unified, extensible ecosystem for describing, composing, simulating and collaborating within 3D worlds. OpenUSD is a key technology in Autodesk’s suite of products and solutions, across media and entertainment; architecture, engineering and construction; and product design and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Unveiled at the <a href="https://conferences.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/au2023/web/page/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AU 2023</a> conference this week, the latest OpenUSD updates to Autodesk Maya enable artists and technical professionals to create and manipulate OpenUSD assets with greater control and efficiency, while also ensuring more efficient and accurate 3D workflows.</p>
<h2><b></b><b>Bridging the Digital and Real Worlds With Maya and OpenUSD</b></h2>
<p>Many creators are using Maya and OpenUSD to propel their 3D workflows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karol-osinski-3dartist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karol Osinski</a> is a 3D artist at <a href="http://www.s20m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S20M</a>, an architectural and design firm that specializes in tackling unique, bold and elegant projects. When it comes to creating architectural visualizations, Osinski says the biggest challenge is matching the digital world to the real one.</p>
<p>Using USD and creative tools such as Maya, SideFX Houdini and Epic Games’ Unreal Engine, Osinski creates high-quality visuals for clients while accelerating his architectural workflows.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-68143 aligncenter" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-38.gif" alt="" width="644" height="363" /><i>Osinski’s panoramic view from the 20th floor terrace in the Upper East Side</i></p>
<p>“OpenUSD provides the possibility of bridging different tools like never before,” said Osinski. “I love how accessible USD is for first-time users and how it opens opportunities to make designs very complex.”</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/sir-wade-autodesk-maya-blender-davinci-resolve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Sir Wade” Neistadt</a>, an animator and YouTube creator, aims to make animation and 3D education more accessible through his video tutorials and industry training. The first step of his unique animation workflow is to act out his animations on camera. He then translates them in Maya to begin his animation work before using USD to export them to other 3D software, including Blender, for finishing touches.</p>

<p>3D artists at NVIDIA are also experiencing the power of Maya and OpenUSD. Technical specialist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lee-fraser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lee Fraser</a> led the “Ferret-Tale Project” to showcase character creation and animation workflows enabled by OpenUSD and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>To create the demo, Fraser and his team collaborated across 3D applications like Blender, Autodesk Maya and Reallusion Character Creator through <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/ecosystem/">OpenUSD Connectors</a>. This allowed them to reduce the data prep and import and export time that’s usually required when working with multiple data sources.</p>
<p>“My favorite thing about using OpenUSD is not having to think about where the 3D files I use originated from,” Fraser said. “It was also easy to use USD layers to experiment with applying different animation clips with different characters.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The telecommunications industry — the backbone of today’s interconnected world — is valued at a staggering $1.7 trillion globally, <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS51360523">according to IDC</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a massive operation, as telcos process hundreds of petabytes of data in their networks each day. That magnitude is only increasing, as the total amount of data transacted globally is forecast to grow to more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/">180 zettabytes by 2025</a>.</p>
<p>To meet this demand for data processing and analysis, telcos are turning to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>, which is improving efficiency and productivity across industries.</p>
<p>NVIDIA announced an <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-introduces-generative-ai-foundry-service-on-microsoft-azure-for-enterprises-and-startups-worldwide">AI foundry service</a> — a collection of NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a> framework and tools, and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a> AI supercomputing and services — that gives enterprises an end-to-end solution for creating and optimizing custom generative AI models.</p>
<p>Using the AI foundry service, Amdocs, a leading provider of software and services for communications and media providers, will optimize enterprise-grade <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">large language models</a> for the telco and media industries to efficiently deploy generative AI use cases across their businesses, from customer experiences to network operations and provisioning. The LLMs will run on NVIDIA accelerated computing as part of the <a href="https://www.amdocs.com/products-services/amaiz-telco-grade-genai-framework">Amdocs amAIz framework</a>.</p>
<p>The collaboration builds on the previously announced <a href="https://www.amdocs.com/news-press/amdocs-and-microsoft-expand-strategic-partnership-reimagine-telco-experience">Amdocs-Microsoft partnership</a>, enabling service providers to adopt these applications in secure, trusted environments, including on premises and in the cloud.</p>
<h2><b>Custom Models for Custom Results</b></h2>
<p>While preliminary applications of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> used broad datasets, enterprises have become increasingly focused on developing custom models to perform specialized, industry-specific skills.</p>
<p>By training models on proprietary data, telcos can deliver tailored solutions that produce more accurate results for their use cases.</p>
<p>To simplify the development, tuning and deployment of such custom models, Amdocs is integrating the new NVIDIA AI foundry service.</p>
<p>Equipped with these new generative AI capabilities — including <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-chatbot-guardrails-nemo/">guardrail</a> features — service providers can enhance performance, optimize resource utilization and flexibly scale to meet future needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Automotive companies are transforming every phase of their product lifecycle — evolving their primarily physical, manual processes into software-driven, AI-enhanced digital systems.</p>
<p>To help them save costs and reduce lead times, NVIDIA is announcing two new simulation engines on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/cloud/">Omniverse Cloud</a>: the virtual factory simulation engine and the autonomous vehicle (AV) simulation engine.</p>
<p>Omniverse Cloud, a platform-as-a-service for developing and deploying applications for industrial digitalization, is hosted on Microsoft Azure. This one-stop shop enables automakers worldwide to unify digitalization across their core product and business processes. It allows enterprises to achieve faster production and more efficient operations, improving time to market and enhancing sustainability initiatives.</p>
<p>For design, engineering and manufacturing teams, digitalization streamlines their work, converting once primarily manual industrial processes into efficient systems for concept and styling; AV development, testing and validation; and factory planning.</p>
<h2><b>Virtual Factory Simulation Engine</b></h2>
<p>The Omniverse Cloud virtual factory simulation engine is a collection of customizable developer applications and services that enable factory planning teams to connect large-scale industrial datasets while collaborating, navigating and reviewing them in real time.</p>
<p>Design teams working with 3D data can assemble virtual factories and share their work with thousands of planners who can view, annotate and update the full-fidelity factory dataset from lightweight devices. By simulating virtual factories on Omniverse Cloud, automakers can increase throughput and production quality while saving years of effort and millions of dollars that would result from making changes once construction is underway.</p>
<p>On Omniverse Cloud, teams can create interoperability between existing software applications such as Autodesk Factory Planning, which supports the entire lifecycle for building, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing and factory lines, as well as Siemens’ NX, Process Simulate and Teamcenter Visualization software and the JT file format. They can share knowledge and data in real time in live, virtual factory reviews across 2D devices or in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-extended-reality/">extended reality</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/t-systems-announces-digital-twin-offering-powered-by-nvidia-omniverse-1051446">T-Systems</a>, a leading IT solutions provider for Europe’s largest automotive manufacturers, is building and deploying a custom virtual factory application that its customers can deploy in Omniverse Cloud.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/our-partners/nvidia-omniverse">SoftServe</a>, an elite member of the NVIDIA Service Delivery Partner program, is also developing custom factory simulation and visualization solutions on this Omniverse Cloud engine, covering factory design, production planning and control.</p>
<h2><b>AV Simulation Engine</b></h2>
<p>The AV simulation engine is a service that delivers physically based sensor simulation, enabling AV and robotics developers to run autonomous systems in a closed-loop virtual environment.</p>
<p>The next generation of AV architectures will be built on large, unified AI models that combine layers of the vehicle stack, including perception, planning and control. Such new architectures call for an integrated approach to development.</p>
<p>With previous architectures, developers could train and test these layers independently, as they were governed by different models. For example, simulation could be used to develop a vehicle’s planning and control system, which only needs basic information about objects in a scene — such as the speed and distance of surrounding vehicles — while perception networks could be trained and tested on recorded sensor data.</p>
<p>However, using simulation to develop an advanced unified AV architecture requires sensor data as the input. For a simulator to be effective, it must be able to simulate vehicle sensors, such as cameras, radars and lidars, with high fidelity.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, NVIDIA is bringing state-of-the-art sensor simulation pipelines used in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/simulation/">DRIVE Sim</a> and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim">Isaac Sim</a> to Omniverse Cloud on Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>Omniverse Cloud sensor simulation provides AV and robotics workflows with high-fidelity, physically based simulation for cameras, radars, lidars and other types of sensors. It can be connected to existing simulation applications, whether developed in-house or provided by a third party, via Omniverse Cloud application programming interfaces for integration into workflows.</p>
<h2><b>Fast Track to Digitalization</b></h2>
<p>The factory simulation engine is now available to customers via an Omniverse Cloud enterprise private offer through the <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/nvidia.nvidia-omniverse-cloud?tab=Overview">Azure Marketplace</a>, which provides access to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ovx/">NVIDIA OVX</a> systems and fully managed Omniverse software, reference applications and workflows. The sensor simulation engine is coming soon.</p>
<p>Enterprises can now also deploy <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/enterprise/">Omniverse Enterprise</a> on new <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/nvidia.nvidia-omniverse-workstation?tab=Overview">optimized Azure virtual machines</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Today’s landscape of free, open-source <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">large language models</a> (LLMs) is like an all-you-can-eat buffet for enterprises. This abundance can be overwhelming for developers building custom generative AI applications, as they need to navigate unique project and business requirements, including compatibility, security and the data used to train the models.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/">NVIDIA AI Foundation Models</a> — a curated collection of enterprise-grade pretrained models — give developers a running start for bringing custom generative AI to their enterprise applications.</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA-Optimized Foundation Models Speed Up Innovation </b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA AI Foundation Models can be experienced through a simple user interface or API, directly from a browser. Additionally, these models can be accessed from NVIDIA AI Foundation Endpoints to test model performance from within their enterprise applications.</p>
<p>Available models include leading community models such as Llama 2, Stable Diffusion XL and Mistral, which are formatted to help developers streamline customization with proprietary data. Additionally, models have been optimized with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt#inference">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a> to deliver the highest throughput and lowest latency and to run at scale on any NVIDIA GPU-accelerated stack. For instance, the Llama 2 model optimized with TensorRT-LLM runs nearly <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-supercharges-large-language-model-inference-on-nvidia-h100-gpus/">2x faster</a> on NVIDIA H100.</p>
<p>The new NVIDIA family of <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ai-foundation-models-build-custom-enterprise-chatbots-and-co-pilots-with-production-ready-llms/">Nemotron-3 8B foundation models</a> supports the creation of today’s most advanced enterprise chat and Q&amp;A applications for a broad range of industries, including healthcare, telecommunications and financial services.</p>
<p>The models are a starting point for customers building secure, production-ready generative AI applications, are trained on responsibly sourced datasets and operate at comparable performance to much larger models. This makes them ideal for enterprise deployments.</p>
<p>Multilingual capabilities are a key differentiator of the Nemotron-3 8B models. Out of the box, the models are proficient in over 50 languages, including English, German, Russian, Spanish, French, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Italian and Dutch.</p>
<h2><b>Fast-Track Customization to Deployment</b></h2>
<p>Enterprises leveraging generative AI across business functions need an AI foundry to customize models for their unique applications. NVIDIA’s AI foundry features three elements — NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a> framework and tools, and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a> AI supercomputing services. Together, these provide an end-to-end enterprise offering for creating custom generative AI models.</p>
<p>Importantly, enterprises own their customized models and can deploy them virtually anywhere on accelerated computing with enterprise-grade security, stability and support using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software.</p>
<p>NVIDIA AI Foundation Models are freely available <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/ai-foundation-models">to experiment with now on the NVIDIA NGC catalog</a> and Hugging Face, and are also hosted in the Microsoft Azure AI model catalog.</p>
