<p>NVIDIA will continue working with Adobe to support advanced generative AI models, with a focus on deep integration into the apps the world’s leading creators use.</p>
<h2><b>Making Moves on Video</b></h2>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most popular and powerful video editing solutions.</p>
<p>Its Enhance Speech tool, accelerated by RTX, uses AI to remove unwanted noise and improve the quality of dialogue clips so they sound professionally recorded. It’s up to 4.5x faster on RTX PCs.</p>
<figure id="attachment_73176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73176" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/enhance-speech.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-73176 size-full" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/enhance-speech.png" alt="" width="672" height="445" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/enhance-speech.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/enhance-speech-400x265.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/enhance-speech-325x215.png 325w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/enhance-speech-151x100.png 151w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-73176" class="wp-caption-text">Adobe Premiere Pro’s AI-powered Enhance Speech tool removes unwanted noise and improves dialogue quality.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/auto-reframe.html">Auto Reframe</a>, another Adobe Premiere feature, uses GPU acceleration to identify and track the most relevant elements in a video, and intelligently reframes video content for different aspect ratios. Scene Edit Detection automatically finds the original edit points in a video, a necessary step before the video editing stage begins.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How to detect a cut with Scene Edit Detection in Premiere Pro" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DYor3a5DKBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Visual Effects</b></h2>
<p>Separating a foreground object from a background is a crucial step in many visual effects and compositing workflows.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects has a new feature that uses a matte to isolate an object, enabling capabilities including background replacement and the selective application of effects to the foreground.</p>
<p>Using the <a target="_blank" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/roto-brush-refine-matte.html">Roto Brush</a> tool, artists can draw strokes on representative areas of the foreground and background elements. After Effects uses that information to create a segmentation boundary between the foreground and background elements, delivering cleaner cutouts with fewer clicks.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How to use Next-Gen Rotobrush 3 in Adobe After Effects" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VJ3cNt0yEhQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Creating 3D Product Shots</b></h2>
<p>The Substance 3D Collection is Adobe’s solution for 3D material authoring, texturing and rendering, enabling users to rapidly create stunningly photorealistic 3D content, including models, materials and lighting.</p>
<p>Visualizing products and designs in the context of a space is compelling, but it can be time-consuming to find the right environment for the objects to live in. Substance 3D Stager’s<a target="_blank" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/substance-3d-stager/features/generative-background.html"> Generative Background</a> feature, powered by Adobe Firefly, solves this issue by letting artists quickly explore generated backgrounds to composite 3D models.</p>
<p>Once an environment is selected, Stager can automatically match the perspective and lighting to the generated background.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Generate Background Images Fast in Substance 3D Stager &amp; Firefly | Adobe Substance 3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/woUUPrSiVPc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Material Authoring With AI</b></h2>
<p>Adobe Substance 3D Sampler, also part of the Substance 3D Collection, is designed to transform images of surfaces and objects into photorealistic physically based rendering (PBR) materials, 3D models and high-dynamic range environment lights. With the recent introduction of<a target="_blank" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/substance-3d-sampler/release-notes/version-4-4---substance-3d-sampler.html"> new generative workflows powered by Adobe Firefly</a>, Sampler is making it easier than ever for artists to explore variations when creating materials for everything from product visualization projects to the latest AAA games.</p>
<p>Sampler’s Text-to-Texture feature allows users to generate tiled images from detailed text prompts. These generated images can then be edited and transformed into photorealistic PBR materials using the machine learning-powered Image-to-Material feature or any Sampler filter.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How to Use Generative Tools in Sampler for Fast Iterations | Adobe Substance 3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YD3tPlO5h3g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Image-to-Texture similarly enables the creation of tiled textures from reference images, providing an alternate way to prompt and generate variations from existing visual content.</p>
<figure id="attachment_73179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73179" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-73179 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture-801x450.png 801w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture-383x215.png 383w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture.png 975w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-73179" class="wp-caption-text">Adobe 3D Sampler’s Image-to-Texture feature.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sampler’s Text-to-Pattern feature uses text prompts to generate tiling patterns, which can be used as base colors or inputs for various filters, such as the Cloth Weave filter for creating original fabric materials.</p>
<p>All of these generative AI features in the Substance 3D Collection, supercharged with RTX GPUs, are designed to help 3D creators ideate and create faster.</p>
<h2><b>Photo-tastic Features</b></h2>
<p>Adobe Lightroom’s AI-powered <a target="_blank" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-cc/using/enhance-details.html">Raw Details</a> feature produces crisp detail and more accurate renditions of edges, improves color rendering and reduces artifacts, enhancing the image without changing its original resolution. This feature is handy for large displays and prints, where fine details are visible.</p>
<figure id="attachment_73182" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73182" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-73182 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance-672x412.png" alt="" width="672" height="412" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance-672x412.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance-400x245.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance-768x471.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance-734x450.png 734w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance-351x215.png 351w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance-163x100.png 163w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance.png 926w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-73182" class="wp-caption-text">Enhance, enhance, enhance.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-cc/using/enhance-details.html">Super Resolution</a> helps create an enhanced image with similar results as Raw Details but with 2x the linear resolution. This means that the enhanced image will have 2x the width and height of the original image — or 4x the total pixel count. This is especially useful for increasing the resolution of cropped imagery.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA RTX Accelerates AI Super Resolution in Adobe Photoshop" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UURFgE43PUg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>For faster editing, AI-powered, RTX-accelerated masking tools like Select Subject, which isolates people from an image, and Select Sky, which captures skies, enable users to create complex masks with the click of a button.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">Generative AI</a> applications have little, or sometimes negative, value without accuracy — and accuracy is rooted in data.</p>
<p>To help developers efficiently fetch the best proprietary data to generate knowledgeable responses for their AI applications, NVIDIA today announced four new <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/nemo/">NVIDIA NeMo Retriever NIM</a> inference microservices.</p>
<p>Combined with <a target="_blank" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-ai-foundry-custom-llama-generative-models">NVIDIA NIM inference microservices for the Llama 3.1</a> model collection, also announced today, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/develop-production-grade-text-retrieval-pipelines-for-rag-with-nvidia-nemo-retriever">NeMo Retriever NIM microservices</a> enable enterprises to scale to <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/build-an-agentic-rag-pipeline-with-llama-3-1-and-nvidia-nemo-retriever-nims">agentic AI workflows</a> — where AI applications operate accurately with minimal intervention or supervision — while delivering the highest accuracy retrieval-augmented generation, or <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">RAG</a>.</p>
<p>NeMo Retriever allows organizations to seamlessly connect custom models to diverse business data and deliver highly accurate responses for AI applications using RAG. In essence, the production-ready microservices enable highly accurate information retrieval for building highly accurate AI applications.</p>
<p>For example, NeMo Retriever can boost model accuracy and throughput for developers creating AI agents and customer service chatbots, analyzing security vulnerabilities or extracting insights from complex supply chain information.</p>
<p>NIM inference microservices enable high-performance, easy-to-use, enterprise-grade inferencing. And with NeMo Retriever NIM microservices, developers can benefit from all of this — superpowered by their data.</p>
<p>These new NeMo Retriever <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-eu/glossary/vector-database/#:~:text=What%20is%20an%20Embedding%20Model%3F">embedding</a> and reranking NIM microservices are now generally available:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">NV-EmbedQA-E5-v5, a popular community base embedding model optimized for text question-answering retrieval</li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">NV-EmbedQA-Mistral7B-v2, a popular multilingual community base model fine-tuned for text embedding for high-accuracy question answering</li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">Snowflake-Arctic-Embed-L, an optimized community model, and</li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">NV-RerankQA-Mistral4B-v3, a popular community base model fine-tuned for text reranking for high-accuracy question answering.</li>
</ul>
<p>They join the collection of NIM microservices easily accessible through the <a target="_blank" href="https://build.nvidia.com/explore/retrieval">NVIDIA API catalog</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Embedding and Reranking Models</b></h2>
<p>NeMo Retriever NIM microservices comprise two model types — embedding and reranking — with open and commercial offerings that ensure transparency and reliability.</p>
<figure id="attachment_73135" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73135" style="width: 823px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-73135" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nemo-retriever-rag-example-pipeline.png" alt="A diagram showing a user prompt inquiring about a bill, retrieving the most accurate response.

<p>An <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/vector-database/#:~:text=What%20is%20an%20Embedding%20Model%3F">embedding model</a> transforms diverse data — such as text, images, charts and video — into numerical vectors, stored in a vector database, while capturing their meaning and nuance. Embedding models are fast and computationally less expensive than traditional large language models, or LLMs.</p>
<p>A reranking model ingests data and a query, then scores the data according to its relevance to the query. Such models offer significant accuracy improvements while being computationally complex and slower than embedding models.</p>
<p>NeMo Retriever provides the best of both worlds. By casting a wide net of data to be retrieved with an embedding NIM, then using a reranking NIM to trim the results for relevancy, developers tapping NeMo Retriever can build a pipeline that ensures the most helpful, accurate results for their enterprise.</p>

<p>The team — consisting of NVIDIANs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aerdem4/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1721670200192732&amp;usg=AOvVaw097v0q1qfYZH3Wca9bat0d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahmet Erdem</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benedikt-schifferer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benedikt Schifferer</a>, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Deotte</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giba1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gilberto Titericz</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lytic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ivan Sorokin</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-jegou/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simon Jegou</a> — demonstrated its prowess in generative AI, winning in categories that included text generation, multiple-choice questions, name entity recognition, ranking, and retrieval.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-73115" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-672x156.png" alt="" width="672" height="156" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-672x156.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-400x93.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-768x178.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1536x356.png 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-842x195.png 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-406x94.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-188x44.png 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1280x296.png 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1.png 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>The competition, themed “<a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/amazon-kdd-cup-2024-multi-task-online-shopping-challenge-for-llms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multi-Task Online Shopping Challenge for LLMs</a>,” asked participants to solve various challenges using limited datasets.</p>
<p>“The new trend in LLM competitions is that they don’t give you training data,” said Deotte, a senior data scientist at NVIDIA. “They give you 96 example questions — not enough to train a model — so we came up with 500,000 questions on our own.”</p>
<p>Deotte explained that the NVIDIA team generated a variety of questions by writing some themselves, using a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language model</a> to create others, and transforming existing e-commerce datasets.</p>
<p>“Once we had our questions, it was straightforward to use existing frameworks to fine-tune a language model,” he said.</p>
<p>The competition organizers hid the test questions to ensure participants couldn’t exploit previously known answers. This approach encourages models that generalize well to any question about e-commerce, proving the model’s capability to handle real-world scenarios effectively.</p>
<p>Despite these constraints, Team NVIDIA’s innovative approach outperformed all competitors by using Qwen2-72B, a just-released LLM with 72 billion parameters, fine-tuned on eight NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, and employing QLoRA, a technique for fine-tuning models with datasets.</p>
<h2><strong>About the KDD Cup 2024</strong></h2>
<p>The KDD Cup, organized by the Association for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, or ACM SIGKDD, is a prestigious annual competition that promotes research and development in the field.</p>
<p>This year’s challenge, hosted by Amazon, focused on mimicking the complexities of online shopping with the goal of making it a more intuitive and satisfying experience using large language models. Organizers utilized the test dataset ShopBench — a benchmark that replicates the massive challenge for online shopping with 57 tasks and about 20,000 questions derived from real-world Amazon shopping data — to evaluate participants&#8217; models.</p>
<p>The ShopBench benchmark focused on four key shopping skills, along with a fifth “all-in-one” challenge:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shopping Concept Understanding: Decoding complex shopping concepts and terminologies.</li>
<li>Shopping Knowledge Reasoning: Making informed decisions with shopping knowledge.</li>
<li>User Behavior Alignment: Understanding dynamic customer behavior.</li>
<li>Multilingual Abilities: Shopping across languages.</li>
<li>All-Around: Solving all tasks from the previous tracks in a unified solution.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>NVIDIA’s Winning Solution</strong></h2>
<p>NVIDIA’s winning solution involved creating a single model for each track.</p>
<p>The team fine-tuned the just-released Qwen2-72B model using eight NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs for approximately 24 hours. The GPUs provided fast and efficient processing, significantly reducing the time required for fine-tuning.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-73118" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-672x191.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="191" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-672x191.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-400x114.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-768x219.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-1536x438.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-842x240.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-406x116.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-188x54.jpg 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-1280x365.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2.jpg 1811w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>First, the team generated training datasets based on the provided examples and synthesized additional data using Llama 3 70B hosted on <a href="http://build.nvidia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build.nvidia.com</a>.</p>
<p>Next, they employed QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation), a training process using the data created in step one. QLoRA modifies a smaller subset of the model’s weights, allowing efficient training and fine-tuning.</p>
<p>The model was then quantized — making it smaller and able to run on a system with a smaller hard drive and less memory — with AWQ 4-bit and used the vLLM inference library to predict the test datasets on four NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs within the time constraints.</p>
<p>This approach secured the top spot in each individual track and the overall first place in the competition—a clean sweep for NVIDIA for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>The team plans to submit a detailed paper on its solution next month and plans to present its findings at KDD 2024 in Barcelona.</p>

<p>It’s progress the wider community is starting to acknowledge.</p>
<p>“Even if the predictions that data centers will soon account for 4% of global energy consumption become a reality, AI is having a major impact on reducing the remaining 96% of energy consumption,” said a <a href="https://lisboncouncil.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/LISBON_COUNCIL_Research_Sustainable_Computing_For_A_Sustainable_Planet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from Lisbon Council Research, a nonprofit formed in 2003 that studies economic and social issues.</p>
<p>The article from the Brussels-based research group is among a handful of big-picture AI policy studies starting to emerge. It uses Italy’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/supercomputing-ai-eurohpc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leonardo supercomputer</a>, accelerated with nearly 14,000 NVIDIA GPUs, as an example of a system advancing work in fields from automobile design and drug discovery to weather forecasting.</p>

<h2><b>Why Accelerated Computing Is Sustainable Computing</b></h2>
<p>Accelerated computing uses the parallel processing of NVIDIA GPUs to do more work in less time. As a result, it consumes less energy than general-purpose servers that employ CPUs built to handle one task at a time.</p>
<p>That’s why accelerated computing is <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/sustainable-computing/?ncid=so-link-848252-vt04" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainable computing</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_73075" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73075" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/power-to-time-gpu-vs-cpu-graph.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-73075 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/power-to-time-gpu-vs-cpu-graph-672x297.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="297" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/power-to-time-gpu-vs-cpu-graph-672x297.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/power-to-time-gpu-vs-cpu-graph-400x177.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/power-to-time-gpu-vs-cpu-graph-768x340.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/power-to-time-gpu-vs-cpu-graph-842x373.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/power-to-time-gpu-vs-cpu-graph-406x180.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/power-to-time-gpu-vs-cpu-graph-188x83.jpg 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/power-to-time-gpu-vs-cpu-graph.jpg 1146w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-73075" class="wp-caption-text">Accelerated systems use parallel processing on GPUs to do more work in less time, consuming less energy than CPUs.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The gains are even greater when <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/why-gpus-are-great-for-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accelerated systems apply AI</a>, an inherently parallel form of computing that’s the most transformative technology of our time.</p>
<p>“When it comes to frontier applications like machine learning or deep learning, the performance of GPUs is an order of magnitude better than that of CPUs,” the report said.</p>
<p>By transitioning from CPU-only operations to GPU-accelerated systems, HPC and AI workloads can save over 40 terawatt-hours of energy annually, equivalent to the electricity needs of nearly 5 million U.S. homes.</p>

<h2><b>User Experiences With Accelerated AI</b></h2>
<p>Users worldwide are documenting energy-efficiency gains with AI and accelerated computing.</p>
<p>In financial services, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/grace-hopper-murex-mx-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Murex</a> — a Paris-based company with a trading and risk-management platform used daily by more than 60,000 people — tested the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip</a>. On its workloads, the CPU-GPU combo delivered a 4x reduction in energy consumption and a 7x reduction in time to completion compared with CPU-only systems (see chart below).</p>
<p>“On risk calculations, Grace is not only the fastest processor, but also far more power-efficient, making green IT a reality in the trading world,” said Pierre Spatz, head of quantitative research at Murex.</p>

<p>In manufacturing, Taiwan-based <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/digital-twins-modulus-wistron/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wistron</a> built a digital copy of a room where <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DGX systems</a> undergo thermal stress tests to improve operations at the site. It used <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform for industrial digitization, with a surrogate model, a version of AI that emulates simulations.</p>
<p>The digital twin, linked to thousands of networked sensors, enabled Wistron to increase the facility’s overall energy efficiency by up to 10%. That amounts to reducing electricity consumption by 120,000 kWh per year and carbon emissions by a whopping 60,000 kilograms.</p>
<h2><b>Up to 80% Fewer Carbon Emissions</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/apache-spark-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark</a> can reduce the carbon footprint for data analytics, a widely used form of machine learning, by as much as 80% while delivering 5x average speedups and 4x reductions in computing costs, according to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/spark-rapids-energy-efficiency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>Thousands of companies — about 80% of the Fortune 500 — use <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/apache-spark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apache Spark</a> to analyze their growing mountains of data. Companies using NVIDIA’s Spark accelerator include Adobe, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/att-data-science-rapids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AT&amp;T</a> and the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/cloudera-spark-irs-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Internal Revenue Service</a>.</p>

<p>In healthcare, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/insilico-medicine-uses-generative-ai-to-accelerate-drug-discovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insilico Medicine</a> discovered and put into phase 2 clinical trials a drug candidate for a relatively rare respiratory disease, thanks to its NVIDIA-powered AI platform.</p>
<p>Using traditional methods, the work would have cost <a href="https://www.knowledgeportalia.org/costs-r-d#:~:text=Breaking%20down%20the%20total%20costs,million%20and%20%241%2C460%20million%20capitalized." target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $400 million</a> and taken <a href="http://phrma-docs.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/rd_brochure_022307.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to six years</a>. But with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a>, Insilico hit the milestone for one-tenth of the cost in one-third of the time.</p>
<p>“This is a significant milestone not only for us, but for everyone in the field of AI-accelerated drug discovery,” said Alex Zhavoronkov, CEO of Insilico Medicine.</p>
<p>This is just a sampler of results that users of accelerated computing and AI are pursuing at companies such as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/genomics-ai-amgen-superpod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amgen</a>, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/bmw-nvidia-isaac-factory-logistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BMW</a>, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/foxconn-digital-twin-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foxconn</a>, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/gpu-inference-momentum-continues-to-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal</a> and many more.</p>
<h2><b>Speeding Science With Accelerated AI </b></h2>
<p>In basic research, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (<a href="https://www.nersc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NERSC</a>), the U.S. Department of Energy’s lead facility for open science, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gpu-energy-efficiency-nersc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measured results</a> on a server with four <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> compared with dual-socket x86 CPU servers across four of its key high-performance computing and AI applications.</p>
<p>Researchers found that the apps, when accelerated with the NVIDIA A100 GPUs, saw <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/energy-efficiency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy efficiency</a> rise 5x on average (see below). One application, for weather forecasting, logged gains of nearly 10x.</p>

<p>Scientists and researchers worldwide depend on AI and accelerated computing to achieve high performance and efficiency.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/green500-energy-efficient-supercomputers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent ranking</a> of the world’s most energy-efficient supercomputers, known as the <a href="https://top500.org/lists/green500/2024/06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green500</a>, NVIDIA-powered systems swept the top six spots, and 40 of the top 50.</p>
<h2><b>Underestimated Energy Savings</b></h2>
<p>The many gains across industries and science are sometimes overlooked in forecasts that extrapolate only the energy consumption of training the largest AI models. That misses the benefits from most of an AI model’s life when it’s consuming relatively little energy, delivering the kinds of efficiencies users described above.</p>
<p>In an analysis citing dozens of sources, a <a href="https://www2.datainnovation.org/2024-ai-energy-use.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a> debunked as misleading and inflated projections based on training models.</p>
<p>“Just as the early predictions about the energy footprints of e-commerce and video streaming ultimately proved to be exaggerated, so too will those estimates about AI likely be wrong,” said the report from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a Washington-based think tank.</p>
<p>The report notes as much as 90% of the cost — and all the efficiency gains — of running an AI model are in deploying it in applications after it’s trained.</p>
<p>“Given the enormous opportunities to use AI to benefit the economy and society — including transitioning to a low-carbon future — it is imperative that policymakers and the media do a better job of vetting the claims they entertain about AI’s environmental impact,” said the report’s author, who described his findings in a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/itif-daniel-castro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent podcast</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Others Cite AI’s Energy Benefits</b></h2>
<p>Policy analysts from the R Street Institute, also in Washington, D.C., agreed.</p>
<p>“Rather than a pause, policymakers need to help realize the potential for gains from AI,” the group wrote in a 1,200-word <a href="https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/accelerated-computing-artificial-intelligence-and-the-computational-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>.</p>
<p>“Accelerated computing and the rise of AI hold great promise for the future, with significant societal benefits in terms of economic growth and social welfare,” it said, citing demonstrated benefits of AI in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10302890/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drug discovery</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-05-31/jpmorgan-s-push-into-finance-ai-has-wall-street-rushing-to-catch-up#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banking</a>, <a href="https://business.fiu.edu/graduate/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-the-stock-market.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stock trading</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/04/17/harnessing-the-power-of-ai-in-the-insurance-sector/?sh=7b17b48335d6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insurance</a>.</p>
<p>AI can make the electric grid, manufacturing and transportation sectors more efficient, it added.</p>
<h2><b>AI Supports Sustainability Efforts</b></h2>
<p>The reports also cited the potential of accelerated AI to fight climate change and promote sustainability.</p>
<p>“AI can enhance the accuracy of <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020MS002109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weather modeling</a> to improve public safety as well as generate more accurate predictions of <a href="https://medium.com/@xtomsmith/ai-in-agriculture-improving-crop-yield-and-farming-efficiency-4c02bfa334ed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crop yields</a>. The power of AI can also contribute to … developing more precise <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/230331-johns-hopkins-scientists-leverage-ai-to-discover-climate-tipping-points" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate models</a>,” R Street said.</p>
<p>The Lisbon report added that AI plays “a crucial role in the innovation needed to address climate change” for work such as discovering more efficient battery materials.</p>
<h2><b>How AI Can Help the Environment</b></h2>
<p>ITIF called on governments to adopt AI as a tool in efforts to decarbonize their operations.</p>
<p>Public and private organizations are already applying NVIDIA AI to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/coral-reef-decline-curee-robot-jetson-isaac-omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protect coral reefs</a>, improve <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-wildfires-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracking of wildfires</a> and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/weather-forecast-corrdiff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extreme weather</a>, and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/mondavi-monarch-smart-electric-jetson-tractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhance sustainable agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>For its part, NVIDIA is working with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/earth-day-2024-climate-tech-ai-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of startups</a> employing AI to address climate issues. NVIDIA also announced plans for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/high-performance-computing/earth-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earth-2</a>, expected to be the world’s most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to climate science.</p>
<h2><b>Enhancing Energy Efficiency Across the Stack</b></h2>
<p>Since its founding in 1993, NVIDIA has worked on energy efficiency across all its products — GPUs, CPUs, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/whats-a-dpu-data-processing-unit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DPUs</a>, networks, systems and software, as well as platforms such as Omniverse.</p>
<p>In AI, the brunt of an AI model’s life is in inference, delivering insights that help users achieve new efficiencies. The <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip</a> has demonstrated 25x energy efficiency over the prior NVIDIA Hopper GPU generation in AI inference.</p>
<p>Over the last eight years, NVIDIA GPUs have advanced a whopping 45,000x in their energy efficiency running large language models (see chart below).</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/llm-inference-energy-efficient.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-73069 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/llm-inference-energy-efficient-672x368.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="368" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/llm-inference-energy-efficient-672x368.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/llm-inference-energy-efficient-400x219.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/llm-inference-energy-efficient-768x420.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/llm-inference-energy-efficient-1536x841.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/llm-inference-energy-efficient-822x450.jpg 822w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/llm-inference-energy-efficient-393x215.jpg 393w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/llm-inference-energy-efficient-183x100.jpg 183w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/llm-inference-energy-efficient-1280x701.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/llm-inference-energy-efficient.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>Recent innovations in software include <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-supercharges-large-language-model-inference-on-nvidia-h100-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TensorRT-LLM</a>. It can help GPUs reduce 3x the energy consumption of LLM inference.</p>
<p>Here’s an eye-popping stat: If the efficiency of cars improved as much as NVIDIA has advanced the efficiency of AI on its accelerated computing platform, cars would get 280,000 miles per gallon. That means you could drive to the moon on less than a gallon of gas.</p>
<p>The analysis applies to the fuel efficiency of cars NVIDIA’s whopping 10,000x efficiency gain in AI training and inference from 2016 to 2025 (see chart below).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>AI has seen unprecedented growth — spurring the need for new training and education resources for students and industry professionals.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s latest on-demand webinar, <a href="https://nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/other2024-aicareer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essential Training and Tips to Accelerate Your Career in AI</a>, featured a panel discussion with industry experts on fostering career growth and learning in AI and other advanced technologies.</p>
<p>Over 1,800 attendees gained insights on how to kick-start their careers and use NVIDIA’s technologies and resources to accelerate their professional development.</p>
<h2><b>Opportunities in AI</b></h2>
<p>AI’s impact is touching nearly every industry, presenting new career opportunities for professionals of all backgrounds.</p>
<p>Lauren Silveira, a university recruiting program manager at NVIDIA, challenged attendees to take their unique education and experience and apply it in the AI field.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to work directly in AI to impact the industry,” said Silveira. “I knew I wouldn’t be a doctor or engineer — that wasn’t in my career path — but I could create opportunities for those that wanted to pursue those dreams.”</p>
<p>Kevin McFall, a principal instructor for the <a href="https://learn.nvidia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute</a>, offered some advice for those looking to navigate a career in AI and advanced technologies but finding themselves overwhelmed or unsure of where to start.</p>
<p>“Don’t try to do it all by yourself,” he said. “Don’t get focused on building everything from scratch — the best skill that you can have is being able to take pieces of code or inspiration from different resources and plug them together to make a whole.”</p>
<p>A main takeaway from the panelists was that students and industry professionals can significantly enhance their capabilities by leveraging tools and resources in addition to their networks.</p>
<p>Every individual can access a variety of free software development kits, community resources and specialized courses in areas like robotics, CUDA and OpenUSD through the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Developer Program</a>. Additionally, they can kick off projects with the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-code-samples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CUDA code sample library</a> and explore specialized guides such as “<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/a-simple-guide-to-deploying-generative-ai-with-nvidia-nim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Simple Guide to Deploying Generative AI With NVIDIA NIM</a>”.</p>
<h2><b>Spinning a Network</b></h2>
<p>Staying up to date on the rapidly expanding technology industry involves more than just keeping up with the latest education and certifications.</p>
<p>Sabrina Koumoin, a senior software engineer at NVIDIA, spoke on the importance of networking. She believes people can find like-minded peers and mentors to gain inspiration from by sharing their <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/sabrina-koumoin/?dysig_tid=7040046f2624437aa2bf3105f501a6a5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal learning journeys</a> or projects on social platforms like LinkedIn.</p>
<p>A self-taught coder, Koumoin also advocates for active engagement and education accessibility. Outside of work, she hosted multiple coding bootcamps for people looking to break into tech.</p>
<p>“It’s a way to show that learning technical skills can be engaging, not intimidating,” she said.</p>
<p>David Ajoku, founder and CEO at Demystifyd and Aware.ai, also emphasized the importance of using LinkedIn to build connections, demonstrate key accomplishments and show passion.</p>
<p>He outlined a three-step strategy to enhance your LinkedIn presence, designed to help you stand out, gain deeper insights into your preferred companies and boldly share your aspirations and interests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Think about a company you’d like to work for and what draws you to it.</li>
<li>Research thoroughly, focusing on its main activities, mission and goals.</li>
<li>Be bold — create a series of posts informing your network about your career journey and what advancements interest you in the chosen company.</li>
</ol>
<p>One attendee asked about how AI might evolve over the next decade and what skills professionals should focus on to stay relevant. Louis Stewart, head of strategic initiatives at NVIDIA, replied that crafting a personal narrative and growth journey is just as important as ensuring certifications and skills are up to date.</p>
<p>“Be intentional and purposeful — have an end in mind,” he said. “That’s how you connect with future potential companies and people — it’s a skill you have to develop to stay ahead.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Groundbreaking research underlines NVIDIA’s critical role in advancing quantum computing. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Research published earlier this month in the science journal <i>Nature </i>used NVIDIA-powered supercomputers to validate a pathway toward the commercialization of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/solutions/quantum-computing/">quantum computing</a>.</p>
<p>The research, led by Nobel laureate Giorgio Parisi and Massimo Bernaschi, director of technology at the National Research Council of Italy and a CUDA Fellow, focuses on quantum annealing, a method that may one day tackle complex optimization problems that are extraordinarily challenging to conventional computers.</p>
<p>To conduct their research, the team utilized 2 million GPU computing hours at the Leonardo facility (Cineca, in Bologna, Italy), nearly 160,000 GPU computing hours on the Meluxina-GPU cluster, in Luxembourg, and 10,000 GPU hours from the Spanish Supercomputing Network. Additionally, they accessed the Dariah cluster, in Lecce, Italy.</p>
<p>They used these state-of-the-art resources to simulate the behavior of a certain kind of quantum computing system known as a quantum annealer.</p>
<p>Quantum computers fundamentally rethink how information is computed to enable entirely new solutions.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7D1Toq1hhJU?si=ZmKsNJuDWubQujg-" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Unlike classical computers, which process information in binary — 0s and 1s — quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can allow information to be processed in entirely new ways.</p>
<p>Quantum annealers are a special type of quantum computer that, though not universally useful, may have advantages for solving certain types of optimization problems.</p>
<p>The paper, “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07647-y">The Quantum Transition of the Two-Dimensional Ising Spin Glass</a>,” represents a significant step in understanding the phase transition — a change in the properties of a quantum system — of Ising spin glass, a disordered magnetic material in a two-dimensional plane, a critical problem in computational physics.</p>
<p>The paper addresses the problem of how the properties of magnetic particles arranged in a two-dimensional plane can abruptly change their behavior.</p>
<p>The study also shows how GPU-powered systems play a key role in developing approaches to quantum computing.</p>
<p>GPU-accelerated simulations allow researchers to understand the complex systems&#8217; behavior in developing quantum computers, illuminating the most promising paths forward.</p>
<p>Quantum annealers, like the systems developed by the pioneering quantum computing company D-Wave, operate by methodically decreasing a magnetic field that is applied to a set of magnetically susceptible particles.</p>
<p>When strong enough, the applied field will act to align the magnetic orientation of the particles — similar to how iron filings will uniformly stand to attention near a bar magnet.</p>
<p>If the strength of the field is varied slowly enough, the magnetic particles will arrange themselves to minimize the energy of the final arrangement.</p>
<p>Finding this stable, minimum-energy state is crucial in a particularly complex and disordered magnetic system known as a spin glass since quantum annealers can encode certain kinds of problems into the spin glass’s minimum-energy configuration.</p>
<p>Finding the stable arrangement of the spin glass then solves the problem.</p>
<p>Understanding these systems helps scientists develop better algorithms for solving difficult problems by mimicking how nature deals with complexity and disorder.</p>
<p>That’s crucial for advancing quantum annealing and its applications in solving extremely difficult computational problems that currently have no known efficient solution — problems that are pervasive in fields ranging from logistics to cryptography.</p>
<p>Unlike gate-model quantum computers, which operate by applying a sequence of quantum gates, quantum annealers allow a quantum system to evolve freely in time.</p>
<p>This is not a universal computer — a device capable of performing any computation given sufficient time and resources — but may have advantages for solving particular sets of optimization problems in application areas such as vehicle routing, portfolio optimization and protein folding.</p>
<p>Through extensive simulations performed on NVIDIA GPUs, the researchers learned how key parameters of the spin glasses making up quantum annealers change during their operation, allowing a better understanding of how to use these systems to achieve a quantum speedup on important problems.</p>
<p>Much of the work for this groundbreaking paper was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s61293/.">first presented</a> at NVIDIA’s GTC 2024 technology conference. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07647-y">Read the full paper</a> and learn more about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D1Toq1hhJU">NVIDIA’s work in quantum computing</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Video is everywhere — nearly 80% of internet bandwidth today is used to stream video from content providers and social networks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/"><i>AI Decoded series</i></a><i>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC and workstation users.</i></p>
<p>Video is everywhere — nearly 80% of internet bandwidth today is used to stream video from content providers and social networks. While screens have become bigger and support higher resolutions, nearly all video is only 1080p quality or lower.</p>
<p>Upscalers can help sharpen streamed video and, powered by AI on the NVIDIA RTX platform, significantly enhance image quality and detail.</p>
<h2><b>What Is an Upscaler?</b></h2>
<p>The larger file size of videos makes it harder to compress and transmit compared to images or text. Platforms like Netflix, Vimeo and YouTube work around this limitation by encoding video — the process of compressing the raw source of a video into a smaller container format.</p>
<p>The encoder first analyzes the video to decide what information it can remove to make it fit a target resolution and frame rate. If the target bitrate is insufficient, the video quality decreases, resulting in a loss of detail and sharpness and the presence of encoding artifacts. The smaller the file, the easier it is to share on the internet — but the worse it looks.</p>
<p>Typically, software on the viewer’s device will upscale the video file to fit the display’s native resolution. However, these upscalers are fairly simplistic, merely multiplying pixels to meet the desired resolution. They can help sharpen the outlines of objects and scenes, but the final video typically carries encoding artifacts and sometimes looks over-sharpened and unnatural.</p>
<h2><b>AI Know a Better Way</b></h2>
<p>The NVIDIA RTX platform uses AI to easily de-artifact and upscale videos.</p>
<figure id="attachment_72985" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72985" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution-signal-flow.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-72985 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution-signal-flow-672x348.png" alt="" width="672" height="348" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution-signal-flow-672x348.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution-signal-flow-400x207.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution-signal-flow-768x398.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution-signal-flow-1536x797.png 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution-signal-flow-842x437.png 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution-signal-flow-406x211.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution-signal-flow-188x97.png 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution-signal-flow-1280x664.png 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution-signal-flow.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-72985" class="wp-caption-text">Easily de-artifact and upscale videos with RTX.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The process of AI upscaling involves analyzing images and motion vectors to generate new details not present in the original video. Instead of merely multiplying pixels, it recognizes the patterns of the image and enhances them to provide greater detail and video quality.</p>
<p>Images must be first de-artifacted before any processing begins. Artifacts — or unwanted distortions and anomalies that appear in video and image files — occur due to overcompression or data loss during transmission and storage.</p>
<p>NVIDIA AI networks can de-artifact images, helping remove blocky areas sometimes seen in streamed video. Without this first step, AI upscalers might end up enhancing the artifacted image itself instead of the desired content.</p>
<h2><b>Super-Sized Video</b></h2>
<p>Just like putting on a pair of prescription glasses can instantly snap the world into focus, RTX Video Super Resolution, one of NVIDIA’s latest innovations in AI-enhanced video technology, gives users a clearer picture into the world of streamed video.</p>
<figure id="attachment_72988" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72988" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution_full-size-scaled-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-72988 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution_full-size-scaled-1-672x378.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution_full-size-scaled-1-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution_full-size-scaled-1-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution_full-size-scaled-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution_full-size-scaled-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution_full-size-scaled-1-800x450.jpg 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution_full-size-scaled-1-382x215.jpg 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution_full-size-scaled-1-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution_full-size-scaled-1-1280x720.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rtx-video-super-resolution_full-size-scaled-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-72988" class="wp-caption-text">Click the image to see the differences between bicubic upscaling (left) and RTX Video Super Resolution (right).</figcaption></figure>
<p>Available on GeForce RTX 40 and 30 Series GPUs and RTX professional GPUs, it uses AI running on dedicated Tensor Cores to remove block compression artifacts and upscale lower-resolution content up to 4K, matching the user’s native display resolution.</p>
<p>RTX Video Super Resolution can be used to enhance all video watched on browsers. By combining de-artifacting with AI upscaling techniques, it can make even low-bitrate Twitch streams look stunningly clear. RTX Video Super Resolution is also supported in popular video apps like VLC so users can apply the same upscaling process to their offline videos.</p>
<p>Creators can soon use RTX Video Super Resolution in editing apps like Black Magic’s Davinci Resolve, making it easier than ever to upscale lower-quality video files to 4K resolution, as well as convert standard-dynamic range source files into high-dynamic range (HDR).</p>
<h2><b>Say Hi to High-Dynamic Range</b></h2>
<p>RTX Video now also supports AI HDR. HDR video supports a wider range of colors, lending greater detail especially to the darker and lighter areas of images. The problem is that there isn’t that much HDR content online yet.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Introducing RTX Video HDR: AI-Upscale Video to HDR Quality" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHAjydnpos8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Enter RTX Video HDR — by simply turning on the feature, the AI network will turn any standard or low-dynamic-range content into HDR, performing the correct tone mapping so the image still looks natural and retains its original colors.</p>
<h2><b>AI Across the Board</b></h2>
<p>RTX Video is just the latest implementation of AI upscaling powered by NVIDIA RTX.</p>
<p>Members of the GeForce NOW cloud streaming service can play their favorite PC games on nearly any device. GeForce RTX servers located all over the world first render the game video content, encode it and then stream it to the player’s local device — just like streaming video from other content providers.</p>
<p>Members on older NVIDIA GPU-powered devices can still use AI-enhanced upscaling to improve gameplay quality. This means they can enjoy the best of both worlds — gameplay rendered on servers powered by RTX 4080-class GPUs in the cloud and AI-enhanced streaming quality. Get more information on <a target="_blank" href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5250">enabling AI-enhanced upscaling on GeForce NOW</a>.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/shield/">NVIDIA SHIELD</a> TV takes this one step further, processing AI neural networks directly on its <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/buy/tegra-k1-processor">NVIDIA Tegra</a> system-on-a-chip to upscale 1080p-quality or lower content from nearly any streaming platform to a display’s native resolution. That means users can improve the video quality of content streamed from Netflix, Prime Video, Max, Disney+ and more at the push of a remote button.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>NVIDIA is taking an array of advancements in rendering, simulation and generative AI to <a target="_blank" href="https://s2024.siggraph.org/">SIGGRAPH 2024</a>, the premier computer graphics conference, which will take place July 28 &#8211; Aug. 1 in Denver.</p>
<p>More than 20 papers from NVIDIA Research introduce innovations advancing synthetic data generators and inverse rendering tools that can help train next-generation models. NVIDIA’s AI research is making simulation better by boosting image quality and unlocking new ways to create 3D representations of real or imagined worlds.</p>
<p>The papers focus on diffusion models for visual generative AI, physics-based simulation and increasingly realistic AI-powered rendering. They include two technical <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.siggraph.org/2024/06/siggraph-2024-technical-papers-awards-best-papers-honorable-mentions-and-test-of-time.html/">Best Paper Award winners</a> and collaborations with universities across the U.S., Canada, China, Israel and Japan as well as researchers at companies including Adobe and Roblox.</p>
<p>These initiatives will help create tools that developers and businesses can use to generate complex virtual objects, characters and environments. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/">Synthetic data generation</a> can then be harnessed to tell powerful visual stories, aid scientists&#8217; understanding of natural phenomena or assist in simulation-based training of robots and autonomous vehicles.</p>

<h2><b>Diffusion Models Improve Texture Painting, Text-to-Image Generation</b></h2>
<p>Diffusion models, a popular tool for transforming text prompts into images, can help artists, designers and other creators rapidly generate visuals for storyboards or production, reducing the time it takes to bring ideas to life.</p>
<p>Two NVIDIA-authored papers are advancing the capabilities of these generative AI models.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/consistory/">ConsiStory</a>, a collaboration between researchers at NVIDIA and Tel Aviv University, makes it easier to generate multiple images with a consistent main character — an essential capability for storytelling use cases such as illustrating a comic strip or developing a storyboard. The researchers’ approach introduces a technique called subject-driven shared attention, which reduces the time it takes to generate consistent imagery from 13 minutes to around 30 seconds.</p>

<p>NVIDIA researchers last year won the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/siggraph-research-generative-ai-materials-3d-scenes/">Best in Show award at SIGGRAPH’s Real-Time Live</a> event for AI models that turn text or image prompts into custom textured materials. This year, they’re presenting a paper that applies <a target="_blank" href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/DiffusionTexturePainting/">2D generative diffusion models to interactive texture painting</a> on 3D meshes, enabling artists to paint in real time with complex textures based on any reference image.</p>

<h2><b>Kick-Starting Developments in Physics-Based Simulation</b></h2>
<p>Graphics researchers are narrowing the gap between physical objects and their virtual representations with physics-based simulation — a range of techniques to make digital objects and characters move the same way they would in the real world.</p>
<p>Several NVIDIA Research papers feature breakthroughs in the field, including SuperPADL, a project that tackles the challenge of<a target="_blank" href="https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2024-07_superpadl-scaling-language-directed-physics-based-control-progressive"> simulating complex human motions based on text prompts</a> (see video at top).</p>
<p>Using a combination of reinforcement learning and supervised learning, the researchers demonstrated how the SuperPADL framework can be trained to reproduce the motion of more than 5,000 skills — and can run in real time on a consumer-grade NVIDIA GPU.</p>
<p>Another NVIDIA paper features a <a target="_blank" href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/simplicits/">neural physics method</a> that applies AI to learn how objects — whether represented as a 3D mesh, a NeRF or a solid object generated by a text-to-3D model — would behave as they are moved in an environment.</p>

<p>A paper written in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University researchers develops a new kind of renderer — one that, instead of modeling physical light, can <a target="_blank" href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/prl/miller2024wost/WoStRobin.pdf">perform thermal analysis, electrostatics and fluid mechanics</a>. Named one of five best papers at SIGGRAPH, the method is easy to parallelize and doesn’t require cumbersome model cleanup, offering new opportunities for speeding up engineering design cycles.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>In the example above, the renderer performs a thermal analysis of the Mars Curiosity rover, where keeping temperatures within a specific range is critical to mission success. </i></p>
<p>Additional simulation papers introduce a more efficient technique for <a target="_blank" href="https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2024-07_modeling-hair-strands-roving-capsules">modeling hair strands</a> and a <a target="_blank" href="https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2024-07_fluid-control-laplacian-eigenfunctions">pipeline that accelerates fluid simulation</a> by 10x.</p>
<h2><b>Raising the Bar for Rendering Realism, Diffraction Simulation</b></h2>
<p>Another set of NVIDIA-authored papers present new techniques to model visible light up to 25x faster and simulate diffraction effects — such as those used in radar simulation for training self-driving cars — up to 1,000x faster.</p>
<p>A paper by NVIDIA and University of Waterloo researchers tackles <a target="_blank" href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/publication/steinberg2024diffraction/">free-space diffraction</a>, an optical phenomenon where light spreads out or bends around the edges of objects. The team’s method can integrate with path-tracing workflows to increase the efficiency of simulating diffraction in complex scenes, offering up to 1,000x acceleration. Beyond rendering visible light, the model could also be used to simulate the longer wavelengths of radar, sound or radio waves.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-path-tracing/">Path tracing</a> samples numerous paths — multi-bounce light rays traveling through a scene — to create a photorealistic picture. Two SIGGRAPH papers improve sampling quality for ReSTIR, a path-tracing algorithm first introduced by NVIDIA and Dartmouth College researchers at SIGGRAPH 2020 that has been key to bringing path tracing to games and other real-time rendering products.</p>
<p>One of these papers, a collaboration with the University of Utah, shares a new way to reuse calculated paths that <a target="_blank" href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/publication/zhang2024area/">increases effective sample count by up to 25x</a>, significantly boosting image quality. The other <a target="_blank" href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/publication/sawhney2022decorrelating/">improves sample quality</a> by randomly mutating a subset of the light’s path. This helps denoising algorithms perform better, producing fewer visual artifacts in the final render.</p>

<h2><b>Teaching AI to Think in 3D</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA researchers are also showcasing multipurpose AI tools for 3D representations and design at SIGGRAPH.</p>
<p>One paper introduces <a target="_blank" href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/prl/publication/williams2024fvdb/">fVDB,</a> a GPU-optimized framework for 3D deep learning that matches the scale of the real world. The fVDB framework provides AI infrastructure for the large spatial scale and high resolution of city-scale 3D models and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-decoded-instant-nerf/">NeRFs</a>, and segmentation and reconstruction of large-scale point clouds.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72931" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fVDB_Cropped.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>A Best Technical Paper award winner written in collaboration with Dartmouth College researchers introduces a theory for <a target="_blank" href="https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2024-07_microfacets-participating-media-unified-theory-light-transport-stochastic">representing how 3D objects interact with light</a>. The theory unifies a diverse spectrum of appearances into a single model.</p>
<p>And a collaboration with University of Tokyo, University of Toronto and Adobe Research introduces an algorithm that <a target="_blank" href="https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2024-07_surface-filling-curve-flows-implicit-medial-axes">generates smooth, space-filling curves on 3D meshes</a> in real time. While previous methods took hours, this framework runs in seconds and offers users a high degree of control over the output to enable interactive design.</p>

The Hewlett Packard Enterprise Cray XD system will feature <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Quantum-2</a> InfiniBand networking for superior performance and scalability.</p>
<p>ABCI 3.0 is the latest iteration of Japan’s large-scale Open AI Computing Infrastructure designed to advance AI R&amp;D. This collaboration underlines Japan’s commitment to advancing its AI capabilities and fortifying its technological independence.</p>
<p>“In August 2018, we launched ABCI, the world’s first large-scale open AI computing infrastructure,” said AIST Executive Officer Yoshio Tanaka. “Building on our experience over the past several years managing ABCI, we’re now upgrading to ABCI 3.0. In collaboration with NVIDIA and HPE we aim to develop ABCI 3.0 into a computing infrastructure that will advance further research and development capabilities for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> in Japan.”</p>
<p>“As generative AI prepares to catalyze global change, it’s crucial to rapidly cultivate research and development capabilities within Japan,” said AIST Solutions Co. Producer and Head of ABCI Operations Hirotaka Ogawa. “I’m confident that this major upgrade of ABCI in our collaboration with NVIDIA and HPE will enhance ABCI’s leadership in domestic industry and academia, propelling Japan towards global competitiveness in AI development and serving as the bedrock for future innovation.”</p>

<h2><strong>ABCI 3.0: A New Era for Japanese AI Research and Development</strong></h2>
<p>ABCI 3.0 is constructed and operated by AIST, its business subsidiary, AIST Solutions, and its system integrator, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).</p>
<p>The ABCI 3.0 project follows support from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, known as METI, for strengthening its computing resources through the Economic Security Fund and is part of a broader $1 billion initiative by METI that includes both ABCI efforts and investments in cloud AI computing.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is closely <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/japan-sovereign-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaborating with METI</a> on research and education following a visit last year by company founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, who met with political and business leaders, including Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, to discuss the future of AI.</p>
<h2><strong>NVIDIA’s Commitment to Japan’s Future</strong></h2>
<p>Huang pledged to collaborate on research, particularly in generative AI, robotics and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-quantum-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum computing</a>, to invest in AI startups and provide product support, training and education on AI.</p>
<p>During his visit, Huang emphasized that “AI factories” — next-generation data centers designed to handle the most computationally intensive AI tasks — are crucial for turning vast amounts of data into intelligence.</p>
<p>“The AI factory will become the bedrock of modern economies across the world,” Huang said during a meeting with the Japanese press in December.</p>
<p>With its ultra-high-density data center and energy-efficient design, ABCI provides a robust infrastructure for developing AI and big data applications.</p>
<p>The system is expected to come online by the end of this year and offer state-of-the-art AI research and development resources. It will be housed in Kashiwa, near Tokyo.</p>
<h2><strong>Unmatched Computing Performance and Efficiency</strong></h2>

					<description><![CDATA[In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, generative AI is captivating imaginations and transforming industries.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/"><i>AI Decoded series</i></a><i>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible and showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for NVIDIA RTX PC and workstation users.</i></p>
<p>In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> is captivating imaginations and transforming industries. Behind the scenes, an unsung hero is making it all possible: microservices architecture.</p>
<h2><b>The Building Blocks of Modern AI Applications</b></h2>
<p>Microservices have emerged as a powerful architecture, fundamentally changing how people design, build and deploy software.</p>
<p>A microservices architecture breaks down an application into a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a specific capability and communicates with other services through well-defined application programming interfaces, or APIs. This modular approach stands in stark contrast to traditional all-in-one architectures, in which all functionality is bundled into a single, tightly integrated application.</p>
<p>By decoupling services, teams can work on different components simultaneously, accelerating development processes and allowing updates to be rolled out independently without affecting the entire application. Developers can focus on building and improving specific services, leading to better code quality and faster problem resolution. Such specialization allows developers to become experts in their particular domain.</p>
<p>Services can be scaled independently based on demand, optimizing resource utilization and improving overall system performance. In addition, different services can use different technologies, allowing developers to choose the best tools for each specific task.</p>
<h2><b>A Perfect Match: Microservices and Generative AI</b></h2>
<p>The microservices architecture is particularly well-suited for developing generative AI applications due to its scalability, enhanced modularity and flexibility.</p>
<p>AI models, especially <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language models</a>, require significant computational resources. Microservices allow for efficient scaling of these resource-intensive components without affecting the entire system.</p>
<p>Generative AI applications often involve multiple steps, such as data preprocessing, model inference and post-processing. Microservices enable each step to be developed, optimized and scaled independently. Plus, as AI models and techniques evolve rapidly, a microservices architecture allows for easier integration of new models as well as the replacement of existing ones without disrupting the entire application.</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA NIM: Simplifying Generative AI Deployment</b></h2>
<p>As the demand for AI-powered applications grows, developers face challenges in efficiently deploying and managing AI models.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM inference microservices</a> provide models as optimized containers to deploy in the cloud, data centers, workstations, desktops and laptops. Each NIM container includes the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-pretrained-ai-model/">pretrained AI models</a> and all the necessary runtime components, making it simple to integrate AI capabilities into applications.</p>
<p>NIM offers a game-changing approach for application developers looking to incorporate AI functionality by providing simplified integration, production-readiness and flexibility. Developers can focus on building their applications without worrying about the complexities of data preparation, model training or customization, as NIM inference microservices are optimized for performance, come with runtime optimizations and support industry-standard APIs.</p>
<h2><b>AI at Your Fingertips: NVIDIA NIM on Workstations and PCs</b></h2>
<p>Building enterprise generative AI applications comes with many challenges. While cloud-hosted model APIs can help developers get started, issues related to data privacy, security, model response latency, accuracy, API costs and scaling often hinder the path to production.</p>
<p>Workstations with NIM provide developers with secure access to a broad range of models and performance-optimized inference microservices.</p>
<p>By avoiding the latency, cost and compliance concerns associated with cloud-hosted APIs as well as the complexities of model deployment, developers can focus on application development. This accelerates the delivery of production-ready generative AI applications — enabling seamless, automatic scale out with performance optimization in data centers and the cloud.</p>
<p>The recently announced general availability of the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/llama-3-nim-healthcare-generative-ai/">Meta Llama 3 8B model as a NIM</a>, which can run locally on RTX systems, brings state-of-the-art language model capabilities to individual developers, enabling local testing and experimentation without the need for cloud resources. With NIM running locally, developers can create sophisticated <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</a> projects right on their workstations.</p>
<p>Local RAG refers to implementing RAG systems entirely on local hardware, without relying on cloud-based services or external APIs.</p>
<p>Developers can use the Llama 3 8B NIM on workstations with one or more <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-6000/">NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation GPUs</a> or on NVIDIA RTX systems to build end-to-end RAG systems entirely on local hardware. This setup allows developers to tap the full power of Llama 3 8B, ensuring high performance and low latency.</p>
<p>By running the entire RAG pipeline locally, developers can maintain complete control over their data, ensuring privacy and security. This approach is particularly helpful for developers building applications that require real-time responses and high accuracy, such as customer-support chatbots, personalized content-generation tools and interactive virtual assistants.</p>
<p>Hybrid RAG combines local and cloud-based resources to optimize performance and flexibility in AI applications. With <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/">NVIDIA AI Workbench</a>, developers can get started with the hybrid-RAG Workbench Project — an example application that can be used to run vector databases and embedding models locally while performing inference using NIM in the cloud or data center, offering a flexible approach to resource allocation.</p>
<p>This hybrid setup allows developers to balance the computational load between local and cloud resources, optimizing performance and cost. For example, the vector database and embedding models can be hosted on local workstations to ensure fast data retrieval and processing, while the more computationally intensive inference tasks can be offloaded to powerful cloud-based NIM inference microservices. This flexibility enables developers to scale their applications seamlessly, accommodating varying workloads and ensuring consistent performance.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a> NIM inference microservices bring digital humans, AI non-playable characters (NPCs) and interactive avatars for customer service to life with generative AI, running on RTX PCs and workstations.</p>
<p>ACE NIM inference microservices for speech — including Riva automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech and neural machine translation — allow accurate transcription, translation and realistic voices.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA Nemotron small language model is a NIM for intelligence that includes INT4 quantization for minimal memory usage and supports roleplay and RAG use cases.</p>
<p>And ACE NIM inference microservices for appearance include Audio2Face and Omniverse RTX for lifelike animation with ultrarealistic visuals. These provide more immersive and engaging gaming characters, as well as more satisfying experiences for users interacting with virtual customer-service agents.</p>
<h2><b>Dive Into NIM</b></h2>
