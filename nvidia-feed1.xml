										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Outside the glare of the klieg lights that ChatGPT commanded this year, a troupe of autonomous machines nudged the frontiers of robotics forward.</p>
<p>Here are six that showed special prowess — swimming, diving, gripping, seeing, strolling and flying through 2023.</p>
<h2><b>A Media Darling at CES</b></h2>
<p>Ella — a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ella-stroller-jetson/">smart stroller</a> from startup <a href="https://gluxkind.com/">Glüxkind Technologies</a>, of Vancouver, Canada — kicked off the year when it was named an honoree in the <a href="https://www.ces.tech/innovation-awards/honorees.aspx">CES 2023 Innovation Awards</a>.</p>
<p>The canny carriage uses computer vision running on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform</a> to follow parents. Its AI-powered abilities, like smart braking and a rock-my-baby mode, captured the attention of media outlets like <i>Good Morning America</i> and <i>The Times of London</i> as well as an <a href="https://soundcloud.com/theaipodcast/ai-stroller">NVIDIA AI Podcast interview</a> with its husband-and-wife cofounders.</p>
<p>A member of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a>, a free program for cutting-edge startups, Gl<a href="https://gluxkind.com/">ü</a>xkind was one of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/jetson-innovation-awards-ces/">seven companies</a> with NVIDIA-powered products recognized at the Las Vegas event in January. They included:</p>
<ul>
<li>John Deere for its fully autonomous tractor,</li>
<li>AGRIST for its robot that automatically harvests bell peppers,</li>
<li>Inception member Skydio for its drone that can fly at a set distance and height without manual intervention,</li>
<li>Neubility, another Inception member, for its self-driving delivery robot,</li>
<li>Seoul Robotics, a partner in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/intelligent-video-analytics-platform/">NVIDIA Metropolis</a> vision AI software, for its <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/seoul-robotics-autonomy-through-infrastructure/">Level 5 Control Tower</a> that can turn standard vehicles into self-driving cars, and</li>
<li>WHILL for its one-person vehicle that automatically guides a user inside places like airports or hospitals.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Dexterous Food Packer</b></h2>
<p>Inception startup Soft Robotics, of Bedford, Mass., introduced its mGripAI system to an $8 trillion food industry hungry for automation. It combines 3D vision and AI to grasp delicate items such as chicken wings, attracting investors that include Tyson Foods and Johnsonville.</p>
<p>Soft Robotics uses the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platform and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim">NVIDIA Isaac Sim</a> robotics simulator to create 3D renderings of chicken parts on conveyor belts or in bins. With help from AI and the ray-tracing capabilities of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/ampere-architecture/">NVIDIA RTX</a> technology, they help the robot gripper handle as many as 100 picks per minute, even under glare or changing light conditions.</p>
<p>“We’re all in on Omniverse and Isaac Sim, and that’s been working great for us,” David Weatherwax, senior director of software engineering at Soft Robotics, said in a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/isaac-soft-robotics-simulation/">January interview</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="mGripAI Poultry Automation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YhfdyOa-XPQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>A Keen Eye in the Factory</b></h2>
<p>In a very different example of industrial digitalization, leading electronics manufacturer Quanta is inspecting the quality of its products using<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/techman-robot-isaac-sim/"> the TM25S</a>, an AI-enabled robot from its subsidiary, Techman Robot.</p>
<p>Using Omniverse, Techman built a<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/"> digital twin</a> of the inspection robot — as well as the product to be inspected — in Isaac Sim. Programming the robot in simulation reduced time spent on the task by over 70%, compared to programming manually on the real robot.</p>
<p>Then, with powerful optimization tools in Isaac Sim, Techman explored a massive number of program options in parallel on NVIDIA GPUs. The end result, shown in the video below, was an efficient solution that reduced the cycle time of each inspection by 20%.</p>
<p><iframe title="Techman AI Robot for Quality Inspection | Developed in Isaac Sim and powered by Omniverse" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b2yjubjQ5Xs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Sailing the Seas for Data Science</b></h2>
<p>For its part, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/saildrone-autonomous-oceanic-monitoring-jetson-deepstream/">Saildrone</a>, an Inception startup in Alameda, Calif., created uncrewed watercraft that can cost-effectively gather data for science, fisheries, weather forecasting and more. NVIDIA Jetson modules process data streams from their sensors, some with help from NVIDIA Metropolis vision AI software such as <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk">NVIDIA DeepStream</a>, a development kit for intelligent video analytics.</p>
<p>The video below shows how three of its smart sailboats are helping evaluate ocean health around the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p><iframe title="2023 UH Mānoa Ocean Chemistry Mission" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ev2mLKXkfwY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Destination: Mars</b></h2>
<p>The next stop for one autonomous vehicle may be the red planet.</p>
<p>Caltech’s Multi-Modal Mobility Morphobot, or <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/caltech-nasa-mars-rover-robot-jetson/">M4</a>, can configure itself to walk, fly or drive at speeds up to 40 mph (video below). An M42 version is now under development at NASA as a Mars rover candidate and has attracted interest for other uses like reconnaissance in fire zones.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39018-y">releasing a paper</a> on it in <i>Nature Communications</i>, the team has been inundated with proposals for the shape-shifting drone built on the NVIDIA Jetson platform.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="M4 Drives and Flies Around Caltech&#039;s Campus" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J91jTI2-k_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Delivery Drone Flies High</b></h2>
<p>The year ended on a high note with San Francisco-based <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/zipline-drone-jetson-inception/">Zipline announcing</a> its delivery drones flew more than 55 million miles and made more than 800,000 deliveries since the company’s start in 2011. Zipline now completes one delivery every 70 seconds, globally.</p>
<p>That’s a major milestone for the Inception startup, the field it’s helping pioneer and the customers who can receive everything from pizza to vitamins 7x faster than by truck.</p>
<p>Zipline’s latest drone uses two Jetson Orin NX modules. It can carry eight pounds of cargo for 10 miles at up to 70 mph to deliver packages in single-digit minutes while reducing carbon emissions 97% compared to gasoline-based delivery vehicles.</p>
<h2><b>Machines That Inspire, Amuse</b></h2>
<p>Individual makers designed two autonomous vehicles this year worth special mentions.</p>

<p>Kabilan KB, a robotics developer and student in Coimbatore, India, built an <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/kabilan-kb-autonomous-wheelchair/">autonomous wheelchair</a> using Jetson to run computer vision models that find and navigate a path to a user’s desired destination. The undergrad at the Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences aspires to one day launch a robotics startup.</p>
<p>Finally, an engineering manager in Copenhagen who’s a self-described <i>Star Wars</i> fanatic designed <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/goran-vuksic-pit-droid/">an AI-powered droid</a> based on an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit</a>. Goran Vuksic shared his step-by-step <a href="https://www.hackster.io/gvuksic/nvidia-jetson-orin-nano-powered-pit-droid-7da0e8">technical guide</a>, so others can build their own sci-fi companions.</p>
<p>More than 6,500 companies and 1.2 million developers — as well as a <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/jetson-projects">community</a> of makers and enthusiasts — use the NVIDIA Jetson and Isaac platforms for edge AI and robotics.</p>
<p>To get a look at where autonomous machines will go next, see what’s coming at <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-innovations-ces-2024/">CES in 2024</a>.</p>

<p>It has aN AI-driven digital solution that enables law practitioners to search laws and cases intelligently within different jurisdictions. It also provides AI-powered tools that are set to be integrated with commonly used products like Microsoft 365 to automate the time-consuming processes of drafting and analyzing legal documents.</p>
<p>These technologies increase the productivity of legal professionals, enabling them to focus their time on higher-value work. According to Wong, ultimately these tools also have the potential to help deliver better access to justice.</p>
<p>To address ethical concerns, the company has created publicly available AI development guidelines, as well as privacy and data protection policies. And it’s participating in the drafting of ethical guidelines for the industries it serves.</p>
<p>There’s still a wide range of reactions surrounding AI use in the legal field, from optimism about its potential to fears of job replacement. But Wong underscored that no matter what the outlook, “it is very likely that professionals that use AI are going to replace professionals that don’t use AI.”</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Thomson Reuters aims to further integrate generative AI, as well as <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/__;!!GFN0sa3rsbfR8OLyAw!eiPNsa31SMQnW-_BuvF_hdx903fjMClGjwTUCUagcdiP8HYXBX9OWWyo4pDmh69GwOf2q9ILffhqxiN-ue1JpPAuGs6aImQ$">retrieval-augmented generation</a> techniques into its flagship research products to help lawyers synthesize, read and respond to complicated technical and legal questions. Recently, Thomson Reuters acquired Casetext, which developed the first AI legal assistant, CoCounsel.</p>
<p>In 2024 Thomson Reuters is building on this with the launch of an AI assistant that will be the interface across Thomson Reuters products with GenAI capabilities, including those in other fields such as tax and accounting.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The latest OpenUSD updates enable users to tackle larger, more complex scenes with enhanced geometry control and streamlined asset management.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/news/"><i>Into the Omniverse</i></a><i>, a series focused on how artists, developers and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advances in </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>OpenUSD</i></a><i> and </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>NVIDIA Omniverse</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<p>3D designers and creators are embracing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description</a>, aka OpenUSD, to transform their workflows.</p>
<p>Creative software company Foundry’s latest release of <a href="https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke-family/nuke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nuke</a>, a powerful compositing tool for visual effects (VFX), is bringing increased support for OpenUSD, a framework that provides a unified and extensible ecosystem for describing, composing, simulating and collaborating within 3D worlds.</p>
<p>With advanced compositing and improved interoperability capabilities, artists are showcasing the immense potential of Nuke and OpenUSD for visual storytelling.</p>
<h2><b>Bringing 3D Visions to Life With Nuke and OpenUSD</b></h2>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWB2cxFgUbCg79XiGKr41GA">Jacob Zirkle</a> is one such 3D artist.</p>
<p>Inspired by his 10th watch through the <i>Star Wars</i> films, Zirkle wanted to create a sci-fi ship of his own. He first combined computer graphics elements in Blender and Unreal Engine before using USD to bring the scene into Nuke for compositing.</p>

<p>OpenUSD was the glue that held his workflow together.</p>
<p>“Usually, I have to deal with multiple, varying file types in my VFX pipeline, and as soon as something gets updated, it can be a real pain to apply the change across the board,” Zirkle said. “But because I was using the same OpenUSD file for all of my programs, I could save the file once, and changes get automatically propagated through the pipeline — saving me a ton of time.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-68789 aligncenter" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-41.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/edward-mcevenue-omniverse-creator/">Edward McEvenue</a>, an associate creative director at NVIDIA, is using OpenUSD and Nuke to create his short film with the working title: “Dare to Dream.”</p>
<p>Through the project, McEvenue hopes to visualize aspects of automated manufacturing. He uses Autodesk 3ds Max and SideFX Houdini for 3D scene creation, Chaos V-Ray for rendering arbitrary output variables and extended dynamic range sequences, and Nuke for compositing elements for final renders.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-68792 aligncenter" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-40.gif" alt="" width="600" height="253" /></p>
<p>OpenUSD helps streamline data transfer between applications, speeding the iteration process. “Nuke’s USD capabilities allow me to seamlessly transition 3D assets between digital content-creation apps, providing a powerful tool for achieving advanced compositing techniques,” he said.</p>
<p>Other NVIDIA creatives have integrated OpenUSD and Nuke into their 3D workflows. A team of 10 artists developed a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/on-demand/session/siggraph2023-sigg23-16/#:~:text=Harnessing%20OpenUSD%3A%20Iteratively%20Building%20a%20Pipeline%20in%20Production,-Will%20Cavanaugh%20%2C%20Sr&amp;text=NVIDIA%27s%20creative%20group%20shows%20how,for%20our%20own%20future%20development.">fully OpenUSD-based pipeline</a> and custom tooling on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> — a development platform for building OpenUSD-based tools and applications — to bring to life the “<a href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/usd/latest/usd_content_samples/davinci_workshop.html">Da Vinci Workshop</a>,” a project to inspire greater OpenUSD use among pipeline developers.</p>
<p>The artists also used Adobe Substance Painter, Autodesk 3ds Max, Autodesk Maya, DaVinci Resolve, SideFX Houdini, Pixelogic Zbrush and Omniverse USD Composer. OpenUSD served as the backbone of the team’s internal pipeline, offering the flexibility needed to collaborate across applications with ease.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The “Da Vinci Workshop”: An OpenUSD Masterpiece" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1PkLdVwOQ1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h2><b>Powering Digital Workflows With OpenUSD</b></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://campaigns.foundry.com/products/nuke-family/whats-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15.0 and 14.1</a> updates to Nuke bring significant workflow enhancements to those working with OpenUSD.</p>
<p>The updated GeoMerge node now offers four new modes: Merge Layers, Duplicate Prims, Flatten Layers and Flatten to Single Layer. These give users greater control over geometry and OpenUSD layers, allowing for quick merging of complex structures, the duplication of workflows and more effective layer management.</p>
<p>The OpenUSD-based 3D system introduced in Nuke 14.0 enables users to handle large, intricate scenes with greater ease. And the new Scene Graph Popup feature in Nuke 15.0 allows users to easily filter through 3D scene data, reducing time and energy needed to spend searching for specific assets.</p>
<p>In addition, the main 3D scene graph now includes a search and filter feature, simplifying workspace navigation.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Nuke 15.0 | Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rQVZbxh_L1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Foundry is also embracing OpenUSD across its other products, including the latest updates to <a href="https://campaigns.foundry.com/products/katana/whats-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katana 7.0</a>, which boost pipeline efficiency by integrating USD-native workflows already aligned with Nuke’s 3D system architecture.</p>

<h2><b>Winter Tinker</b></h2>
<p>Gilmour, this week’s featured NVIDIA Studio artist, grew up in the beautiful winters of Appleton, Wisconsin. It’s no surprise he conjured up chillingly beautiful winter worlds to share with his friends, family and the creative community — fueled by his passion for 3D art.</p>
<p>Shared as long-form videos, these winter wonderlands showcase breathtakingly photorealistic details.</p>
<p>His winter video compilation — featuring “Campfire on a Winter Cliff,” “Dickensian Christmas Reading Nook” and “Northern Lights” — is designed to offer viewers a sense of peace and relaxation while encouraging self-reflection.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Cozy Bed in A-Frame Cabin | Rain Ambience ASMR" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zr77eGeSZac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Gilmour began his creative workflows in Unreal Engine, building out the environments. He used the Ultra Dynamic Sky system plug-in by game developer Everett Gunther, which offered greater flexibility and more customization options to achieve the effects in this northern lights scene.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Wolves and The Northern Lights | Winter Campfire Ambience" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jRImnRwDbj8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Fully built models are available in Unreal Engine, but to achieve further customization, Gilmour created custom 3D meshes in Blender. He used Blender Cycles’ <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a>-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport for interactive, photorealistic rendering — all powered by his <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3060-3060ti/">GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card</a>.</p>
<p>“Originally, I chose an NVIDIA RTX GPU because of its CUDA core integration in Blender’s Cycles rendering engine,” said Gilmour. “Now with ray-tracing capabilities in Unreal Engine 5, it’s a no-brainer.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_68854" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68854" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68854" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w-672x362.png" alt="" width="672" height="362" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w-672x362.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w-400x216.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w-768x414.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w-835x450.png 835w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w-399x215.png 399w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w-186x100.png 186w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68854" class="wp-caption-text">Organizing assets in Unreal Engine.</figcaption></figure>
<p>He then acquired models in Quixel Megascans to block out the scene in Unreal Engine, creating a rough draft using simple, unpolished 3D shapes. This helped to keep base meshes clean, eliminating the need to create new ones in the next iteration.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68857" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68857" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68857" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w-672x364.png" alt="" width="672" height="364" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w-672x364.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w-400x217.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w-768x416.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w-830x450.png 830w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w-397x215.png 397w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w-184x100.png 184w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68857" class="wp-caption-text">Moving models in Unreal Engine.</figcaption></figure>
<p>To build the fire and glowing firewood in his “Campfire on a Winter Cliff” scene, Gilmour used the M5 VFX Vol 2 and Twinmotion Backyard Pack 2 packs from Unreal Engine. The <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk">NVIDIA PhysX </a>SDK, advanced shader support and real-time ray tracing enabled high-fidelity, interactive visualization for swift viewport movement.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Campfire on a Winter Cliff | Crackling Fire ASMR" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gX4RaW7zSqY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>By upgrading to a GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU, Gilmour could use NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation to further improve viewport interactivity by tapping AI to generate additional, high-quality frames, ensuring increased FPS rendered at lower resolution while retaining high-fidelity detail.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dickensian Reading Nook | Ambient Christmas Reading" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W70IiFUgM34?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>When finished building his scenes, Gilmour moved to Blackmagic Design’s DaVinci Resolve to color correct and add subtle film grains, lens distortion, lens reflection and glow effects. It was all GPU-accelerated, including the process of exporting final videos with the eighth-generation <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/broadcasting-guide/">NVENC encoder</a>.</p>

<p>The final touch to Gilmour’s wintry scenes were peaceful tunes, sampled from royalty-free music database Splice.</p>
<p>All that’s left to do is kick back, relax and soak in the scenery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The Wild West had gunslingers, bank robberies and bounties — today’s digital frontier has identity theft, credit card fraud and chargebacks.</p>
<p>Cashing in on financial fraud has become a multibillion-dollar criminal enterprise. And <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> in the hands of fraudsters only promises to make this more profitable.</p>
<p>Credit card losses worldwide are expected to reach $43 billion by 2026, according to the <a href="https://nilsonreport.com/articles/card-fraud-losses-worldwide/"><i>Nilson Report</i></a>.</p>
<p>Financial fraud is perpetrated in a growing number of ways, like harvesting hacked data from the dark web for credit card theft, using generative AI for phishing personal information, and laundering money between cryptocurrency, digital wallets and fiat currencies. Many other financial schemes are lurking in the digital underworld.</p>
<p>To keep up, financial services firms are wielding AI for fraud detection. That’s because many of these digital crimes need to be halted in their tracks in real time so that consumers and financial firms can stop losses right away.</p>
<p>So how is AI used for fraud detection?</p>
<p>AI for fraud detection uses multiple machine learning models to detect anomalies in customer behaviors and connections as well as patterns of accounts and behaviors that fit fraudulent characteristics.</p>
<h2><b>Generative AI Can Be Tapped as Fraud Copilot</b></h2>
<p>Much of financial services involves text and numbers. Generative AI and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/?ncid=em-even-877400-vt46">large language models</a> (LLMs), capable of learning meaning and context, promise disruptive capabilities across industries with new levels of output and productivity. Financial services firms can harness generative AI to develop more intelligent and capable chatbots and improve fraud detection.</p>
<p>On the opposite side, bad actors can circumvent AI guardrails with crafty generative AI prompts to use it for fraud. And LLMs are delivering human-like writing, enabling fraudsters to draft more contextually relevant emails without typos and grammar mistakes. Many different tailored versions of phishing emails can be quickly created, making generative AI an excellent copilot for perpetrating scams. There are also a number of dark web tools like FraudGPT, which can exploit generative AI for cybercrimes.</p>
<p>Generative AI can be exploited for financial harm in voice authentication security measures as well. Some banks are using voice authentication to help authorize users. A banking customer’s voice can be cloned using deep fake technology if an attacker can obtain voice samples in an effort to breach such systems. The voice data can be gathered with spam phone calls that attempt to lure the call recipient into responding by voice.</p>
<p>Chatbot scams are such a problem that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/03/chatbots-deepfakes-voice-clones-ai-deception-sale">called out concerns</a> for the use of LLMs and other technology to simulate human behavior for deep fake videos and voice clones applied in imposter scams and financial fraud.</p>
<h2><b>How Is Generative AI Tackling Misuse and Fraud Detection? </b></h2>
<p>Fraud review has a powerful new tool. Workers handling manual fraud reviews can now be assisted with LLM-based assistants running RAG on the backend to tap into information from policy documents that can help expedite decision-making on whether cases are fraudulent, vastly accelerating the process.</p>
<p>LLMs are being adopted to predict the next transaction of a customer, which can help payments firms preemptively assess risks and block fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p>Generative AI also helps combat transaction fraud by improving accuracy, generating reports, reducing investigations and mitigating compliance risk.</p>
<p>Generating <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/">synthetic data</a> is another important application of generative AI for fraud prevention. Synthetic data can improve the number of data records used to train fraud detection models and increase the variety and sophistication of examples to teach the AI to recognize the latest techniques employed by fraudsters.</p>
<p>NVIDIA offers tools to help enterprises embrace generative AI to build chatbots and virtual agents with a workflow that uses <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a>. RAG enables companies to use natural language prompts to access vast datasets for information retrieval.</p>
<p>Harnessing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/ai-workflows/">NVIDIA AI workflows</a> can help accelerate building and deploying enterprise-grade capabilities to accurately produce responses for various use cases, using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/">foundation models</a>, the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a> framework, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/triton-inference-server/">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a> and GPU-accelerated vector database to deploy RAG-powered chatbots.</p>
<p>There’s an industry focus on safety to ensure generative AI isn’t easily exploited for harm. NVIDIA <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-chatbot-guardrails-nemo/">released NeMo Guardrails</a> to help ensure that intelligent applications powered by LLMs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, are accurate, appropriate, on topic and secure.</p>
<p>The open-source software is designed to help keep AI-powered applications from being exploited for fraud and other misuses.</p>
<h2><b>What Are the Benefits of AI for Fraud Detection?</b></h2>
<p>Fraud detection has been a challenge across banking, finance, retail and e-commerce.  Fraud doesn’t only hurt organizations financially, it can also do reputational harm.</p>
<p>It’s a headache for consumers, as well, when fraud models from financial services firms overreact and register false positives that shut down legitimate transactions.</p>
<p>So financial services sectors are developing more advanced models using more data to fortify themselves against losses financially and reputationally. They’re also aiming to reduce false positives in fraud detection for transactions to improve customer satisfaction and win greater share among merchants.</p>
<h2><b>Financial Services Firms Embrace AI for Identity Verification</b></h2>
<p>The financial services industry is developing AI for identity verification. AI-driven applications using deep learning with graph neural networks (GNNs), natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision can improve identity verification for know-your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements, leading to improved regulatory compliance and reduced costs.</p>
<p>Computer vision analyzes photo documentation such as drivers licenses and passports to identify fakes. At the same time, NLP reads the documents to measure the veracity of the data on the documents as the AI analyzes them to look for fraudulent records.</p>
<p>Gains in KYC and AML requirements have massive regulatory and economic implications. Financial institutions, including banks, were fined nearly $5 billion for AML, breaching sanctions as well as failures in KYC systems in 2022, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7a4821e6-96f1-475c-ae55-6401e402061f">according to the <i>Financial Times</i></a>.</p>
<h2><b>Harnessing Graph Neural Networks and NVIDIA GPUs </b></h2>
<p>GNNs have been embraced for their ability to reveal suspicious activity. They’re capable of looking at billions of records and identifying previously unknown patterns of activity to make correlations about whether an account has in the past sent a transaction to a suspicious account.</p>
<p>NVIDIA has an alliance with the Deep Graph Library team, as well as the PyTorch Geometric team, which provides a GNN framework containerized offering that includes the latest updates, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rapids">NVIDIA RAPIDS</a> libraries and more to help users stay up to date on cutting-edge techniques.</p>
<p>These GNN framework containers are NVIDIA-optimized and performance-tuned and tested to get the most out of NVIDIA GPUs.</p>
<p>With access to the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform, developers can tap into NVIDIA RAPIDS, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/triton-inference-server/">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a> and the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt">NVIDIA TensorRT</a> software development kit to support enterprise deployments at scale.</p>
<h2><b>Improving Anomaly Detection With GNNs</b></h2>
<p>Fraudsters have sophisticated techniques and can learn ways to outmaneuver fraud detection systems. One way is by unleashing complex chains of transactions to avoid notice. This is where traditional rules-based systems can miss patterns and fail.</p>
<p>GNNs build on a concept of representation within the model of local structure and feature context. The information from the edge and node features is propagated with aggregation and message passing among neighboring nodes.</p>
<p>When GNNs run multiple layers of graph convolution, the final node states contain information from nodes multiple hops away. The larger receptive field of GNNs can track the more complex and longer transaction chains used by financial fraud perpetrators in attempts to obscure their tracks.</p>
<h2><b>GNNs Enable Training Unsupervised or Self-Supervised </b></h2>
<p>Detecting financial fraud patterns at massive scale is challenged by the tens of terabytes of transaction data that needs to be analyzed in the blink of an eye and a relative lack of labeled data for real fraud activity needed to train models.</p>
<p>While GNNs can cast a wider detection net on fraud patterns, they can also train on an <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/supervised-unsupervised-learning/">unsupervised or self-supervised</a> task.</p>
<p>By using techniques such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06514">Bootstrapped Graph Latents</a> — a graph representation learning method — or <a href="https://graph-neural-networks.github.io/static/file/chapter10.pdf">link prediction with negative sampling</a>, GNN developers can pretrain models without labels and fine-tune models with far fewer labels, producing strong graph representations. The output of this can be used for models like XGBoost, GNNs or techniques for clustering, offering better results when deployed for inference.</p>
<h2><b>Tackling Model Explainability and Bias</b></h2>
<p>GNNs also enable model explainability with a suite of tools. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-explainable-ai/">Explainable AI</a> is an industry practice that enables organizations to use such tools and techniques to explain how AI models make decisions, allowing them to safeguard against bias.</p>
<p>Heterogeneous graph transformer and graph attention network, which are GNN models, enable attention mechanisms across each layer of the GNN, allowing developers to identify message paths that GNNs use to reach a final output.</p>
<p>Even without an attention mechanism, techniques such as <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/gnnexplainer-neurips19.pdf">GNNExplainer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/flyingdoog/PGExplainer">PGExplainer</a> and <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=WznmQa42ZAx">GraphMask</a> have been suggested to explain GNN outputs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Zipline isn’t just some pie-in-the-sky drone startup.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company has completed more than 800,000 deliveries in seven countries since its start in 2011. It recently added services for Seattle’s Pagliacci Pizza, vitamin and supplement giant GNC, and large health systems like Intermountain Health, OhioHealth and Michigan Medicine.</p>
<p>Zipline developed its drones — which have now flown more than 55 million miles — for autonomous navigation and precision landings using the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/?ncid=pa-srch-goog-680280">NVIDIA Jetson</a> edge AI and robotics platform.</p>
<p>The fast-growing company recently landed $330 million in funding at a more than $4 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Zipline is a member of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a>, a program that provides startups with technological support and AI platform guidance.</p>
<h2><b>Delivering With Jetson-Powered Fleets</b></h2>
<p>The company’s P1 drone, or platform one, has been deployed in production for seven years and currently uses the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/">Jetson Xavier NX</a> system-on-module to process its sensor inputs. It’s guided by GPS, air traffic control communications, inertial measurement unit sensors and its onboard detection and avoidance system, with redundancy of guidance for safety.</p>
<p>“The NVIDIA Jetson module in the wing is part of what delivers our acoustic detection and avoidance system, so it allows us to listen for other aircraft in the airspace around us and plot trajectories that avoid any conflict,” said A.J. Frantz, navigation lead at Zipline.</p>
<p>The company’s fixed-wing drones can fly out more than 55 miles, at 70 miles per hour, for deliveries from one of several Zipline distribution centers and then return. Capable of hauling up to four pounds of cargo, they autonomously fly over delivery locations and release packages that float down to their destination by parachute.</p>
<p>The company’s P2, or platform two, is a hybrid drone that can fly fast on fixed-wing flights — but also hover. It can carry eight pounds of cargo for 10 miles and packs a droid that can be lowered on a tether to complete deliveries with precision placement. It’s intended for use in dense, urban environments.</p>
<p>The P2 uses two <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">Jetson Orin NX</a> modules. One is for the drone’s sensor fusion system to understand environments. The other is in the droid that descends by tether — for redundancy to provide added safety.</p>
<p>“The P2 droid is about bringing the smallest, quickest, safest, quietest drone in for delivery, coming down precisely and leaving the package — and then going back up,” said Joseph Mardall, head of engineering at Zipline. “We want to integrate into people’s lives in a way that they love and that feels magical.”</p>
<p>Zipline completes one delivery every 70 seconds globally.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Zipline releases new drone designed for rapid home deliveries" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtKdLrJLZ5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Flying Away With a Roster of Customers</b></h2>
<p>Zipline’s service offers advantages that are attracting customers. Its drones, fondly nicknamed ‘Zips,’ are capable of 7x faster delivery times compared with vehicle deliveries, according to the company.</p>
<p>“Our aircraft fly at 70 miles per hour, as the crow flies, so no traffic, no waiting at lights — we’re talking minutes here in terms of delivery times,” said Mardall. “Single-digit minutes are common for deliveries, so it’s faster than any alternative, for sure.”</p>
<p>In addition to services for pizza, vitamins and courier meds, Zipline works with Walmart, restaurant chain Sweetgreen, Michigan Medicine, MultiCare Health Systems, Intermountain Health and the government of Rwanda, among others. It also delivers to more than 4,000 hospitals and health centers, according to the company.</p>
<p>Zipline started its service delivering blood in Rwanda seven years ago and later expanded into food and convenience.</p>
<h2><b>Riding Jetson Orin for Energy Efficiency, Environmental Benefits </b></h2>
<p>Delivering energy-efficient computing is mission-critical for the run-time of autonomous machines, used in everything from delivery services and agriculture to mining and undersea exploration. NVIDIA Jetson Orin modules offer up to 275 trillion operations per second while providing market-leading energy efficiency.</p>
<p>“You can pick the right place for your algorithms to run to make sure you’re getting the most out of the hardware and the power that you are putting into the system,” said Frantz.</p>
<p>Startups using Jetson-driven applications are also leading the way in sustainability, as more next-generation electric-driven autonomous machines replace those contributing to pollution.</p>
<p>Deliveries by Zipline offer a 97% reduction in carbon emissions compared with gasoline-driven vehicles, according to the company.</p>
<p>“We are super excited to significantly reduce carbon emissions,” said Mardall. “And when building an electric aircraft, efficiency is totally key — every watt, every fraction of a watt, every joule that we can claw back can be turned into payload and range.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of our weekly </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/in-the-nvidia-studio/"><i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/"><i>NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> technology improves creative workflows. We’re also deep diving on new </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/"><i>GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU</i></a><i> features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.</i></p>
<p>The creative team at <a href="https://moonshine.tw/">Moonshine Studio</a> — an artist-focused visual effects (VFX) studio specializing in animation and motion design — was tasked to solve a problem.</p>
<p>At their Taiwan office, receptionists were constantly engaged in meeting and greeting guests, preventing them from completing other important administrative work. To make matters worse, the automated kiosk greeting system wasn’t working as expected.</p>
<p>Senior Moonshine Studio 3D artist and this week’s <i>In the NVIDIA Studio </i>creator Eric Chiang stepped up to the challenge. He created a realistic, interactive 3D model that would serve as the foundation of a new AI-powered virtual assistant — NANA. The avatar can welcome guests and provide basic company info, easing the strain on the receptionist team.</p>
<p>Chiang built NANA using GPU-accelerated features in his favorite creative apps — powered by his <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/laptops-desktops/">NVIDIA Studio</a>-badged <a href="https://www.msi.com/Desktop/MEG-Trident-X2-13th">MSI MEG Trident X2 PC</a>, which is equipped with a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/">GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card</a>.</p>
<p>His creative workflow was enhanced by the Tensor Cores in his GPU, which supercharged AI-specific tasks — saving him time and elevating the quality of his work. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/">RTX and AI</a> also improve performance in gaming, boost productivity and more.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Take Your Creativity Further with AI &amp; Faster with #AIonRTX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZmbKY44onpg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>These advanced features are supported by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/">NVIDIA Studio Drivers</a>, — free for RTX GPU owners — which add performance and reliability. The December Studio Driver provides support for the Reallusion iClone AccuFACE plugin, GPU audio enhancements, AV1 in HandBrake and more — and is now ready for download.</p>

<h2><b>An AI on the Future</b></h2>
<p>Chiang began in Blender, sculpting intricate 3D models that served as the building blocks for NANA. Blender Cycles’ RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport unlocked interactive, photorealistic modeling.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68732-1" width="1280" height="674" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-Blender-頭部雕刻-1280w.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-Blender-頭部雕刻-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-Blender-頭部雕刻-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He then used the Marvelous Designer software for making, editing and reusing 3D clothes to create realistic clothing for NANA. This streamlined the design and simulation process, ensuring that the avatar is not only structurally sound but impeccably dressed.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68748" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68748" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-image1-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68748" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-image1-1280w-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-image1-1280w-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-image1-1280w-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-image1-1280w-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-image1-1280w-800x450.png 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-image1-1280w-382x215.png 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-image1-1280w-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-image1-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68748" class="wp-caption-text">NANA’s casual day outfit.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Chiang deployed Quixel Mixer and Adobe Substance 3D Painter for shading, adding depth, texture and realism to the 3D models.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68732-2" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-SP_衣服材質-1280w.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-SP_衣服材質-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-SP_衣服材質-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He then used the Blender plug-in AccuRIG to efficiently create precise, adaptable character rigs.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68732-3" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-SP_褲子-1280w.mp4?_=3" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-SP_褲子-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-SP_褲子-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chiang put everything together in Unreal Engine, where he seamlessly integrated 3D objects into the scene, leveraging real-time rendering to create visually stunning results.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68732-4" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-SSS-1280w.mp4?_=4" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-SSS-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-SSS-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS further increased viewport interactivity by using AI to upscale frames rendered at lower resolution while still retaining high-fidelity detail. All of this was powered by his GeForce RTX 4090 GPU.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68754" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68754" style="width: 582px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-msi-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68754" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-msi-1280w-582x500.png" alt="" width="582" height="500" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-msi-1280w-582x500.png 582w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-msi-1280w-400x344.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-msi-1280w-768x660.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-msi-1280w-524x450.png 524w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-msi-1280w-250x215.png 250w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-msi-1280w-406x350.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-msi-1280w-116x100.png 116w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-eric-chiang-wk87-msi-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68754" class="wp-caption-text">The NVIDIA Studio-badged MSI MEG Trident X2 PC, equipped with a GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Chiang is excited about what AI can do for creators and society at large.</p>
<p>“What was once science fiction is now becoming reality, opening the door to a whole new stage of scientific and technological development,” he said. “We are fortunate to participate in and witness this new stage.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Great companies thrive on stories. Sid Siddeek, who runs NVIDIA’s venture capital arm, knows this well.</p>
<p>Siddeek still remembers one of his first jobs, schlepping presentation materials from one investor meeting to another, helping the startup’s CEO and management team get the story out while working from a trailer that “shook when the door opened,” he said.</p>
<p>That CEO was Jensen Huang. The startup was NVIDIA.</p>
<p>Siddeek, who has worked as an investor and an entrepreneur, knows how important it is to find the right people to share your company’s story with early on, whether they’re customers or partners, employees or investors.</p>
<p>It’s this very principle that underpins NVIDIA’s multifaceted approach to investing in the next wave of innovation, a strategy also championed by Vishal Bhagwati, who leads NVIDIA’s corporate development efforts.</p>
<p>It’s an effort that’s resulted in more than two dozen investments so far this year, accelerating as the pace of innovation in AI and accelerated computing quickens.</p>
<h2>NVIDIA’s Three-Pronged Strategy to Support the AI Ecosystem</h2>
<p>There are three ways that NVIDIA invests in the ecosystem, driving the transformation unleashed by accelerated computing. First, through NVIDIA’s corporate investments, overseen by Bhagwati. Second, through <a href="https://www.nventures.ai/">NVentures</a>, our venture capital arm, led by Siddeek. And finally, through <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a>, our vehicle for supporting startups and connecting them to venture capital.</p>
<p>There couldn’t be a better time to support companies harnessing NVIDIA technologies. AI alone could contribute more than $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to PwC.</p>
<p>And if you’re working in AI and accelerated computing right now, NVIDIA stands ready to help. Developers across every industry in every country are building accelerated computing applications. And they’re just getting going.</p>
<p>The result is a collection of companies that are advancing the story of AI every day. They include Cohere, CoreWeave, Hugging Face, Inflection, Inceptive and many more. And we’re right alongside them.</p>
<p>“Partnering with NVIDIA is a game-changer,” said Ed Mehr, CEO of Machina Labs. “Their unmatched expertise will supercharge our AI and simulation capabilities.”</p>
<h2>Corporate Investments: Growing Our Ecosystem</h2>
<p>NVIDIA’s corporate investments arm focuses on strategic collaborations. These partnerships stimulate joint innovation, enhance the NVIDIA platform and expand the ecosystem. Since the beginning of 2023, announcements have been made about 14 investments.</p>
<p>These target companies include Ayar Labs, specializing in chip-to-chip optical connectivity, and Hugging Face, a hub for advanced AI models.</p>
<p>The portfolio also includes next-generation enterprise solutions. Databricks offers an industry-leading data platform for machine learning, while Cohere provides enterprise automation through AI. Other notable companies are Recursion, Kore.ai and Utilidata, each contributing unique solutions in drug discovery, conversational AI and smart electricity grids, respectively.</p>
<p>Consumer services are another investment focus. Inflection is crafting a personal AI for creative expression, while Runway serves as a platform for art and creativity through generative AI.</p>
<p>The investment strategy extends to autonomous machines. Ready Robotics is developing an operating system for industrial robotics, and Skydio builds autonomous drones.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s most recent investments are in cloud service providers like CoreWeave. These platforms cater to a diverse clientele, from startups to Fortune 500 companies seeking to build next-generation AI services.</p>
<h2>NVentures: Investing Alongside Entrepreneurs</h2>
<p>Through NVentures, we support innovators who are deeply relevant to NVIDIA. We aim to generate strong financial returns and expand the ecosystem by funding companies that use our platforms across a wide range of industries.</p>

<p>In addition, we’re continuing to support startups with NVIDIA Inception. Launched in 2016, this free global program offers technology and marketing support to over 17,000 startups across multiple industries and over 125 countries.</p>
<p>And, as part of Inception, we’re partnering with venture capitalists through our VC Alliance, a program that offers benefits to our valued network of venture capital firms, including connecting startups with potential investors.</p>
<h2>Partnering With Innovators in Every Industry</h2>
<p>Whatever our relationship, whether as a partner or investor, we can offer companies unique forms of support.</p>
<p>NVIDIA has the technology. NVIDIA has the richest set of libraries and the deepest understanding of the frameworks needed to optimize training and inference pipelines.</p>
<p>We have the go-to-market skills. NVIDIA has tremendous field sales, solution architect and developer relations organizations with a long track record of working with the most innovative startups and the largest companies in the world.</p>
<p>We know how to grow. We have people throughout our organization who are recognized leaders in their respective fields and can offer expert advice to companies of all sizes and industries.</p>
<p>“Partnering with NVIDIA was an easy choice,” said Victor Riparbelli, cofounder and CEO of Synthesia. “We use their hardware, benefit from their AI expertise and get valuable insights, allowing us to build better products faster.”</p>
<h2>Accelerating the Greatest Breakthroughs of Our Time</h2>
<p>In turn, these investments augment our R&amp;D in the software, systems and semiconductors undergirding this ecosystem.</p>
<p>With NVIDIA’s technologies poised to accelerate the work of researchers and scientists, entrepreneurs, startups and Fortune 500 companies, finding ways to support companies that rely on our technologies— with engineering resources, marketing support and capital — is more vital than ever.</p>

<p>The most technically advanced games now rely on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">techniques that RTX technologies</a> have unlocked.</p>
<p>Ray tracing, enabled by dedicated RT Cores, delivers immersive, realistic lighting and reflections in games.</p>
<p>The technique has evolved from games with only a single graphics element executed in ray tracing to games such as A<i>lan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Minecraft RTX </i>and <i>Portal RTX </i>that use ray tracing for all the light in the game.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS</a>, powered by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/">Tensor Cores</a>, accelerates AI graphics, now boosting performance with DLSS Frame Generation and improving RT effects with DLSS Ray Reconstruction in titles like <i>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</i>.</p>
<p>Beyond gaming, these technologies revolutionize creative workflows, enabling real-time, ray-traced previews in applications that once required extensive processing time.</p>
<p>Ray tracing, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1468075.1468082">a technique first described in 1969 by Arthur Appel</a>, mirrors how light interacts with objects to create lifelike images.</p>
<p>Ray tracing was once limited to high-end movie production. NVIDIA’s RTX graphics cards have made this cinematic quality accessible in real-time gaming, enhancing experiences with dynamic lighting, reflections and shadows.</p>
<p>High engagement rates in titles like <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, <i>NARAKA: BLADEPOINT</i>, <i>Minecraft with RTX</i>, <i>Alan Wake 2</i> and <i>Diablo IV</i>, where 96% or higher of RTX 40 Series t gamers use RTX ON, underscore this success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Accessibility is a key element that all designers must consider before constructing a space or product — but the evaluation process has traditionally been tedious and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Mathew Schwartz, an assistant professor in architecture and design at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, is using the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platform and the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description</a> framework, aka OpenUSD, to help architects, interior designers and industrial designers address this challenge.</p>

Schwartz and his team develop algorithms for research projects and turn them into usable products.</p>
<p>Using Omniverse  — a development platform that enables multi-app workflows and real-time collaboration — the team developed <a href="https://github.com/cadop/dhart">open-source, OpenUSD-based code</a> that automatically generates a complex accessibility graph for building design. This code is based on Schwartz’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S092658052100008X?via%3Dihub">research paper</a>, “Human centric accessibility graph for environment analysis.”</p>
<p>The graph provides feedback related to human movement, such as the estimated energy expenditure required for taking a certain path, the number of steps it takes to complete the path, or the angles of any inclines along it.</p>
<p>With Omniverse, teams can use Schwartz’s code to visualize the graph and the paths that it creates. This can help designers better evaluate building code and safety for occupants while providing important accessibility insights.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Human Accessibility Simulation by Mathew Schwartz" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BGl80SucaiI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>The Power of OpenUSD</b></h2>
<p>Traditionally, feedback on accessibility and environmental conditions during the building design process has been limited to building code analysis. Schwartz’s work enables designers to overcome this obstacle by seamlessly integrating Omniverse and OpenUSD.</p>
<p>Previously, he had to switch between multiple applications to achieve different aspects of his simulation and modeling projects. His workflows were often split between tools such as Unity, which supports simulations with people, and McNeel Rhino3D, which offers 3D modeling features.</p>
<p>With OpenUSD, he can now combine his research, Python code, 3D environments and renders, and favorite tools into Omniverse.</p>
<p>“What got me hooked on Omniverse was how it allows me to combine the Python application programming interface with powerful physics, rendering and animation software,” he said. “My team took full advantage of the flexible Python APIs in Omniverse to develop almost the entire user interface.”</p>
<p>Schwartz’s team uses Omniverse to visualize and interact with existing open-source Python code in ways that don’t require external work, like seamlessly linking to a third-party app. The lab’s versatile data analysis tool can interact with any program that’s compatible with OpenUSD.</p>
<p>“With OpenUSD and Omniverse, we’ve been able to expand the scope of our research, as we can easily combine data analysis and visualization with the design process,” said Schwartz.</p>
<h2><b>Running Realistic Renderings and Simulations</b><b><br />
</b></h2>
<p>Schwartz also uses Omniverse to <a href="https://github.com/cadop/crowds">simulate crowd movement</a> and interactions.</p>
<p>He accelerates large crowd simulations and animations using two <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a4500/">NVIDIA RTX A4500 GPUs</a>, which enable real-time visualization. These accelerated simulations can help designers gain valuable insights into how people with reduced mobility can navigate and interact in spaces.</p>
<p>“We can also show what locations will offer the best areas to place signage so that it’s most visible,” said Schwartz. “Our simulation work can be used to visualize paths taken in an early-stage design — this provides feedback on accessibility to prevent problems with building code, while allowing users to create designs that go beyond the minimum requirements.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GPU Accelerated Crowds by Mathew Schwartz" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3krdUZLHo7I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Schwartz also taps the feedback and assistance of many developers and researchers who actively engage on the Omniverse Discord channel. This collaborative environment has been instrumental in Schwartz’s journey, he said, as well as to the platform’s continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Schwartz’s <a href="https://github.com/cadop/dhart">open-source code</a> is available for designers to use and enhance their design workflows.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Toronto Pearson International Airport, in Ontario, Canada, is the country’s largest and busiest airport, serving some 50 million passengers each year.</p>
<p>To enhance traveler experiences, the airport in June deployed the Zensors AI platform, which uses anonymized footage from existing security cameras to generate spatial data that helps optimize operations in real time.</p>
<p>A member of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/intelligent-video-analytics-platform/">NVIDIA Metropolis</a> vision AI partner ecosystem, <a href="https://www.zensors.com/">Zensors</a> helped the Toronto Pearson operations team significantly reduce wait times in customs lines, decreasing the average time it took passengers to go through the arrivals process from an estimated 30 minutes during peak periods in 2022 to just under six minutes last summer.</p>
<p>“Zensors is making visual AI easy for all to use,” said Anuraag Jain, the company’s cofounder and head of product and technology.</p>
<p>Scaling multimodal, transformer-based AI isn’t easy for most organizations, Jain added, so airports have often defaulted to traditional, less effective solutions based on hardware sensors, lidar or 3D stereo cameras, or look to improve their operations by renovating or building new terminals instead — which can be multibillion-dollar projects.</p>
<p>“We provide a platform that allows airports to instead think more like software companies, deploying quicker, cheaper and more accurate solutions using their existing cameras and the latest AI technologies,” Jain said.</p>
<h2><b>Speeding Airport Operations</b></h2>
<p>To meet the growing travel demands, Toronto Pearson needed a way to improve its operations in a matter of weeks, rather than the months or years it would normally take to upgrade or build new terminal infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Zensors AI platform — deployed to monitor 20+ customs lines in two of the airport’s terminals — delivered such a solution. It converts video feeds from the airport’s existing camera systems into structured data.</p>
<p>Using anonymized footage, the platform counts how many travelers are in a line, identifies congested areas and predicts passenger wait times, among other tasks — and it alerts staff in real time to speed operations.</p>
<p>The platform also offers analytical reports that enable operations teams to assess performance, plan more effectively and redeploy staff for optimal efficiency.</p>
<p>In addition to providing airport operators data-driven insights, live wait-time statistics from Zensors AI are published on Toronto Pearson’s <a href="https://www.torontopearson.com/en/airport-wait-time-dashboard">online dashboard</a>, as well as on electronic displays in the terminals. This lets passengers easily access accurate information about how long customs or security processes will take. And it increases customer satisfaction overall and reduces potential anxieties about whether they’ll be able to make connecting flights.</p>
<p>“The analyses we get from the Zensors platform are proving to be very accurate,” said Zeljko Cakic, director of airport IT planning and development at the Greater Toronto Airport Authority, Toronto Pearson’s managing company. “Our goal is to improve overall customer experience and reduce wait times, and the data gathered through the Zensors platform is one of the key contributors for decision-making to drive these results.”</p>
<h2><b>Accurate AI Powered by NVIDIA</b></h2>
<p>Zensors AI — built with vision <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-transformer-model/">transformer models</a> — offers insights with an impressive accuracy of about 96% compared to when humans validate the information manually. It’s all powered by NVIDIA technology.</p>
<p>“The Zensors model development and inference run-time stack is effectively the NVIDIA AI stack,” Jain said.</p>
<p>The company uses NVIDIA GPUs and the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit">CUDA</a> parallel computing platform to train its AI models, along with the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn">cuDNN</a> accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks and the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/dali">NVIDIA DALI</a> library for decoding and augmenting images and videos.</p>
<p>With checkpoints at Toronto Pearson open 24/7, Zensors AI inference runs around the clock on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/triton-inference-server">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a>, an open-source software available through the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> platform.</p>
<p>The company estimates that using NVIDIA Triton to optimize its inference run-time decreased its monthly cloud GPU spending by more than 20%. In this way, NVIDIA technology enables Zensors to provide a high-availability, production-grade, fully managed service for Toronto Pearson and other clients, Jain said.</p>
<p>“Today, lots of companies and organizations want to adopt AI, but the hard part is figuring out how to go about it,” he added. “Being a part of NVIDIA Metropolis gives us the best tools and enables more visibility for potential end users of Zensors technology, which ultimately lets users deploy AI with ease.”</p>
<p>Zensors is also a member of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a>, a free program that nurtures cutting-edge startups.</p>
<h2><b>Visual AI for the Future of Transportation</b></h2>
<p>Among many other customers who use Zensors AI is Ireland’s Cork Airport, which uses the platform to optimize its operations from curb to gate. In June, Zensors AI was deployed across the airport in just 20 days and, in less than four months, the platform helped save about 90 hours of congestion time through proactive curbside traffic management.</p>
<p>“Aviation is just one part of mobility,” Jain said. “We’re expanding to rail, bus and multimodal transit — and we believe Zensors will provide the layer of intelligence to eventually bring AI to all types of brick-and-mortar operators.”</p>
<p>Looking forward, the company is working to incorporate <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/">large language models</a> into the question-answering capabilities of its platform in a safe, reliable way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Move over, Merriam-Webster: Enterprises this year found plenty of candidates to add for word of the year. “Generative AI” and “generative pretrained transformer” were followed by terms such as “large language models” and “retrieval-augmented generation” (RAG) as whole industries turned their attention to transformative new technologies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Generative AI</a> started the year as a blip on the radar but ended with a splash. Many companies are sprinting to harness its ability to ingest text, voice and video to churn out new content that can revolutionize productivity, innovation and creativity.</p>
<p>Enterprises are riding the trend. Deep learning algorithms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, further trained with corporate data, could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across 63 business use cases, according to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey &amp; Company</a>.</p>
<p>Yet managing massive amounts of internal data often has been cited as the biggest obstacle to scaling AI. Some NVIDIA experts in AI predict that 2024 will be all about phoning a friend — creating partnerships and collaborations with cloud service providers, data storage and analytical companies, and others with the know-how to handle, fine-tune and deploy big data efficiently.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Large language models</a> are at the center of it all. NVIDIA experts say advancements in LLM research will increasingly be applied in business and enterprise applications. AI capabilities like <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RAG</a>, autonomous intelligent agents and multimodal interactions will become more accessible and more easily deployed via virtually any platform.</p>
<p>Hear from NVIDIA experts on what to expect in the year ahead:</p>

<p><strong>MANUVIR DAS<br />
</strong><strong>Vice President of Enterprise Computing</strong></p>
<p><strong>One size doesn’t fit all:</strong> Customization is coming to enterprises. Companies won’t have one or two generative AI applications — many will have hundreds of customized applications using proprietary data that is suited to various parts of their business.</p>
<p>Once running in production, these custom LLMs will feature RAG capabilities to connect data sources to generative AI models for more accurate, informed responses. Leading companies like Amdocs, Dropbox, Genentech, SAP, ServiceNow and Snowflake are already building new generative AI services built using RAG and LLMs.</p>
<p><b>Open-source software leads the charge: </b>Thanks to open-source pretrained models, generative AI applications that solve specific domain challenges will become part of businesses’ operational strategies.</p>
<p>Once companies combine these headstart models with private or real-time data, they can begin to see accelerated productivity and cost benefits across the organization. AI computing and software are set to become more accessible on virtually any platform, from cloud-based computing and AI model foundry services to the data center, edge and desktop.</p>
<p><b>Off-the-shelf AI and microservices: </b>Generative AI has spurred the adoption of application programming interface (API) endpoints, which make it easier for developers to build complex applications.</p>
<p>In 2024, software development kits and APIs will level up as developers customize off-the-shelf AI models using AI microservices such as RAG as a service. This will help enterprises harness the full potential of AI-driven productivity with intelligent assistants and summarization tools that can access up-to-date business information.</p>
<p>Developers will be able to embed these API endpoints directly into their applications without having to worry about maintaining the necessary infrastructure to support the models and frameworks. End users can in turn experience more intuitive, responsive and tailored applications that adapt to their needs.</p>

<p><b>IAN BUCK<br />
</b><b>Vice President of Hyperscale and HPC</b></p>
<p><b>National treasure: </b>AI is set to become the new space race, with every country looking to create its own center of excellence for driving significant advances in research and science and improving GDP.</p>
<p>With just a few hundred nodes of accelerated computing, countries will be able to quickly build highly efficient, massively performant, exascale AI supercomputers. Government-funded generative AI centers of excellence will boost countries’ economic growth by creating new jobs and building stronger university programs to create the next generation of scientists, researchers and engineers.</p>
<p><b>Quantum leaps and bounds:</b> Enterprise leaders will launch <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-quantum-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum computing</a> research initiatives based on two key drivers: the ability to use traditional AI supercomputers to simulate quantum processors and the availability of an open, unified development platform for hybrid-classical quantum computing. This enables developers to use standard programming languages instead of needing custom, specialized knowledge to build quantum algorithms.</p>
<p>Once considered an obscure niche in computer science, quantum computing exploration will become more mainstream as enterprises join academia and national labs in pursuing rapid advances in materials science, pharmaceutical research, subatomic physics and logistics.</p>

<p><b>KARI BRISKI<br />
</b><b>Vice President of AI Software</b></p>
<p><b>From RAG to riches: </b>Expect to hear a lot more about retrieval-augmented generation as enterprises embrace these AI frameworks in 2024.</p>
<p>As companies train LLMs to build generative AI applications and services, RAG is widely seen as an answer to the inaccuracies or nonsensical replies that sometimes occur when the models don’t have access to enough accurate, relevant information for a given use case.</p>
<p>Using semantic retrieval, enterprises will take open-source foundation models, ingest their own data so that a user query can retrieve the relevant data from the index and then pass it to the model at run time.</p>
<p>The upshot is that enterprises can use fewer resources to achieve more accurate generative AI applications in sectors such as healthcare, finance, retail and manufacturing. End users should expect to see more sophisticated, context-sensitive and multimodal chatbots and personalized content recommendation systems that allow them to talk to their data naturally and intuitively.</p>
<p><b>Multimodality makes its mark: </b>Text-based generative AI is set to become a thing of the past. Even as generative AI remains in its infancy, expect to see many industries embrace multimodal LLMs that allow consumers to use a combination of text, speech and images to deliver more contextually relevant responses to a query about tables, charts or schematics.</p>
<p>Companies such as Meta and OpenAI will look to push the boundaries of multimodal generative AI by adding greater support for the senses, which will lead to advancements in the physical sciences, biological sciences and society at large. Enterprises will be able to understand their data not just in text format but also in PDFs, graphs, charts, slides and more.</p>

<p><b>NIKKI POPE<br />
</b><b>Head of AI and Legal Ethics</b></p>
<p><b>Target lock on AI safety: </b>Collaboration among leading AI organizations will accelerate the research and development of robust, safe AI systems. Expect to see emerging standardized safety protocols and best practices that will be adopted across industries, ensuring a consistent and high level of safety across generative AI models.</p>
<p>Companies will heighten their focus on transparency and interpretability in AI systems — and use new tools and methodologies to shed light on the decision-making processes of complex AI models. As the generative AI ecosystem rallies around safety, anticipate AI technologies becoming more reliable, trustworthy and aligned with human values.</p>

<p><b>RICHARD KERRIS<br />
</b><b>Vice President of Developer Relations, Head of Media and Entertainment</b></p>
<p><b>The democratization of development: </b>Virtually anyone, anywhere will soon be set to become a developer. Traditionally, one had to know and be proficient at using a specific development language to develop applications or services. As computing infrastructure becomes increasingly trained on the languages of software development, anyone will be able to prompt the machine to create applications, services, device support and more.</p>
<p>While companies will continue to hire developers to build and train AI models and other professional applications, expect to see significantly broader opportunities for anyone with the right skill set to build custom products and services. They’ll be helped by text inputs or voice prompts, making interactions with computers as simple as verbally instructing it.</p>
<p><b>“Now and Then” in film and song: </b>Just as the “new” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opxhh9Oh3rg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI-augmented song</a> by the Fab Four spurred a fresh round of Beatlemania, the dawn of the first feature-length generative AI movie will send shockwaves through the film industry.</p>
<p>Take a filmmaker who shoots using a 35mm film camera. The same content can soon be transformed into a 70mm production using generative AI, reducing the significant costs involved in film production in the IMAX format and allowing a broader set of directors to participate.</p>
<p>Creators will transform beautiful images and videos into new types and forms of entertainment by prompting a computer with text, images or videos. Some professionals worry their craft will be replaced, but those issues will fade as generative AI gets better at being trained on specific tasks. This, in turn, will free up hands to tackle other tasks and provide new tools with artist-friendly interfaces.</p>

<p><b>KIMBERLY POWELL<br />
</b><b>Vice President of Healthcare </b></p>
<p><b>AI surgical assistants:</b> The day has come when surgeons can use voice to augment what they see and understand inside and outside the surgical suite.</p>
<p>Combining instruments, imaging, robotics and real-time patient data with AI will lead to better surgeon training, more personalization during surgery and better safety with real-time feedback and guidance even during remote surgery. This will help close the gap on the 150 million surgeries that are needed yet <a href="https://horasis.org/global-surgery-a-vital-part-of-the-global-health-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do not</a> occur, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p><b>Generative AI drug discovery factories: </b>A new drug discovery process is emerging, where generative AI molecule generation, property prediction and complex modeling will drive an intelligent lab-in-the-loop flywheel, shortening the time to discover and improving the quality of clinically viable drug candidates.</p>
<p>These AI drug discovery factories employ massive healthcare datasets using whole genomes, atomic-resolution instruments and robotic lab automation capable of running 24/7. For the first time, computers can learn patterns and relationships within enormous and complex datasets and generate, predict and model complex biological relationships that were only previously discoverable through time-consuming experimental observation and human synthesis.</p>

<p><b>CHARLIE BOYLE<br />
</b><b>Vice President of DGX Platforms</b></p>
<p><b>Enterprises lift bespoke LLMs into the cloud: </b>One thing enterprises learned from 2023 is that building LLMs from scratch isn’t easy. Companies taking this route are often daunted by the need to invest in new infrastructure and technology and they experience difficulty in figuring out how and when to prioritize other company initiatives.</p>
<p>Cloud service providers, colocation providers and other businesses that handle and process data for other businesses will help enterprises with full-stack AI supercomputing and software. This will make customizing pretrained models and deploying them easier for companies across industries.</p>
<p><b>Fishing for LLM gold in enterprise data lakes: </b>There’s no shortage of statistics on how much information the average enterprise stores — it can be anywhere in the high hundreds of petabytes for large corporations. Yet many companies <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/whats-your-data-strategy#:~:text=Cross%2Dindustry%20studies%20show%20that,analyzed%20or%20used%20at%20all." target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> that they’re mining less than half that information for actionable insights.</p>
<p>In 2024, businesses will begin using generative AI to make use of that untamed data by putting it to work building and customizing LLMs. With AI-powered supercomputing, business will begin mining their unstructured data — including chats, videos and code — to expand their generative AI development into training multimodal models. This leap beyond the ability to mine tables and other structured data will let companies deliver more specific answers to questions and find new opportunities. That includes helping detect anomalies on health scans, uncovering emerging trends in retail and making business operations safer.</p>

<p><b>GILAD SHAINER<br />
</b><b>Vice President of Networking </b></p>
<p><b>AI influx ignites connectivity demand: </b>A renewed focus on networking efficiency and performance will take off as enterprises seek the necessary network bandwidth for accelerated computing using GPUs and GPU-based systems.</p>
<p>Trillion-parameter LLMs will expose the need for faster transmission speeds and higher coverage. Enterprises that want to quickly roll out generative AI applications will need to invest in accelerated networking technology or choose a cloud service provider that does. The key to optimal connectivity is baking it into full-stack systems coupled with next-generation hardware and software.</p>
<p><b>The defining element of data center design: </b>Enterprises will learn that not all data centers need to be alike. Determining the purpose of a data center is the first step toward choosing the appropriate networking to use within it. Traditional data centers are limited in terms of bandwidth, while those capable of running large AI workloads require thousands of GPUs to work at very deterministic, low-tail latency.</p>
<p>What the network is capable of when under a full load at scale is the best determinant of performance. The future of enterprise data center connectivity requires separate management (aka north-south) and AI (aka east-west) networks, where the AI network includes in-network computing specifically designed for high performance computing, AI and hyperscale cloud infrastructures.</p>

<p><b>DAVID REBER JR.<br />
</b><b>Chief Security Officer</b></p>
<p><b>Clarity in adapting the security model to AI:</b> The pivot from app-centric to data-centric security is in full swing. Data is the fundamental supply chain for LLMs and the future of generative AI. Enterprises are just now seeing the problem unfold at scale. Companies will need to reevaluate people, processes and technologies to redefine the secure development lifecycle (SDLC). The industry at large will redefine its approach to trust and clarify what transparency means.</p>
<p>A new generation of cyber tools will be born. The SDLC of AI will be defined with new market leaders of tools and expectations to address the transition from the command line interface to the human language interface. The need will be especially important as more enterprises shift toward using open-source LLMs like Meta’s Llama 2 to accelerate generative AI output.</p>
<p><b>Scaling security with AI:</b> Applications of AI to the cybersecurity deficit will detect never-before-seen threats. Currently, a fraction of global data is used for cyber defense. Meanwhile, attackers continue to take advantage of every misconfiguration.</p>
<p>Experimentation will help enterprises realize the potential of AI in identifying emergent threats and risks. Cyber copilots will help enterprise users navigate phishing and configuration. For the technology to be effective, companies will need to tackle privacy issues inherent in the intersection of work and personal life to enable collective defense in data-centric environments.</p>
<p>Along with democratizing access to technology, AI will also enable a new generation of cyber defenders as threats continue to grow. As soon as companies gain clarity on each threat, AI will be used to generate massive amounts of data that train downstream detectors to defend and detect these threats.</p>

<p><b>RONNIE VASISHTA<br />
</b><b>Senior Vice President of Telecoms</b></p>
<p><b>Running to or from RAN: </b>Expect to see a major reassessment of investment cases for 5G.</p>
<p>After five years of 5G, network coverage and capacity have boomed — but revenue growth is sluggish and costs for largely proprietary and inflexible infrastructure have risen. Meantime, utilization for 5G RAN is stuck below 40%.</p>
<p>The new year will be about aggressively pursuing new revenue sources on existing spectrum to uncover new monetizable applications. Telecoms also will rethink the capex structure, focusing more on a flexible, high-utilization infrastructure built on general-purpose components. And expect to see a holistic reduction of operating expenses as companies leverage AI tools to increase performance, improve efficiency and eliminate costs. The outcome of these initiatives will determine how much carriers will invest in 6G technology.</p>
<p><b>From chatbots to network management: </b>Telcos are already using generative AI for chatbots and virtual assistants to improve customer service and support. In the new year they’ll double down, ramping up their use of generative AI for operational improvements in areas such as network planning and optimization, fault and fraud detection, predictive analytics and maintenance, cybersecurity operations and energy optimization.</p>
<p>Given how pervasive and strategic generative AI is becoming, building a new type of AI factory infrastructure to support its growth also will become a key imperative. More and more telcos will build AI factories for internal use, as well as deploy these factories as a platform as a service for developers. That same infrastructure will be able to support RAN as an additional tenant.</p>

</b><b>Vice President of Embedded and Edge Computing</b></p>
<p><b>The rise of robotics programmers:</b> LLMs will lead to rapid improvements for robotics engineers. Generative AI will develop code for robots and create new simulations to test and train them.</p>
<p>LLMs will accelerate simulation development by automatically building 3D scenes, constructing environments and generating assets from inputs. The resulting simulation assets will be critical for workflows like synthetic data generation, robot skills training and robotics application testing.</p>
<p>In addition to helping robotics engineers, transformer AI models, the engines behind LLMs, will make robots themselves smarter so that they better understand complex environments and more effectively execute a breadth of skills within them.</p>
<p>For the robotics industry to scale, robots have to become more generalizable — that is, they need to acquire skills more quickly or bring them to new environments. Generative AI models — trained and tested in simulation — will be a key enabler in the drive toward more powerful, flexible and easier-to-use robots.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>A new era of autonomous vehicle technology, known as AV 2.0, has emerged, marked by large, unified AI models that can control multiple parts of the vehicle stack, from perception and planning to control.</p>
<p>Wayve, a London-based autonomous driving technology company and a member of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA&#8217;s Inception startup accelerator program</a>, is leading the surf.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/ai-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA’s AI Podcast</a>, host Katie Burke Washabaugh spoke with the company’s cofounder and CEO, Alex Kendall, about what AV 2.0 means for the future of self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Unlike AV 1.0’s focus on perfecting a vehicle’s perception capabilities using multiple deep neural networks, AV 2.0 calls for comprehensive in-vehicle intelligence to drive decision-making in real-world, dynamic environments.</p>

<p>Embodied AI — the concept of giving AI a physical interface to interact with the world — is the basis of this new AV wave.</p>
<p>Kendall pointed out that it’s a “hardware/software problem — you need to consider these things separately,” even as they work together. For example, a vehicle can have the highest-quality sensors, but without the right software, the system can’t use them to execute the right decisions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Generative AI</a> plays a key role, enabling <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">synthetic data generation</a> so AV makers can use a model’s previous experiences to create and simulate novel driving scenarios.</p>
<p>It can “take crowds of pedestrians and snow and bring them together” to “create a snowy, crowded pedestrian scene” that the vehicle has never experienced before.</p>
<p>According to Kendall, that will “play a huge role in both learning and validating the level of performance that we need to deploy these vehicles safely” — all while saving time and costs.</p>
<p>In June, Wayve unveiled GAIA-1, a generative world model for developing autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>The company also recently announced LINGO-1, an AI model that allows passengers to use natural language to enhance the learning and explainability of AI driving models.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company hopes to scale and further develop its solutions, improving the safety of AVs to deliver value, build public trust and meet customer expectations. Kendall views embodied AI as playing a definitive role in the future of the AI landscape, pushing pioneers to “build better” and “build further” to achieve the “next big breakthroughs.”</p>

<h2><b>Wrapper’s Delight</b></h2>
<p>Balov’s <i>Christmas Rush</i> 3D animation reimagines Santa as a resident of the coastal city of Split, Croatia — but with a harsher, less jolly edge.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68486-5" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-bozo-balov-wk86-face-closeup-1280w.mp4?_=5" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-bozo-balov-wk86-face-closeup-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-bozo-balov-wk86-face-closeup-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Balov jumped straight into modeling edgy Saint Nick in the virtual-reality modeling software Quill. He deployed vertex-painting techniques and used a photogrammetry scan of a Vespa as a base, adding brushstrokes to blend it with the rest of the scene.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68486-6" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-bozo-balov-wk86-turntable-light-1280w.mp4?_=6" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-bozo-balov-wk86-turntable-light-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-bozo-balov-wk86-turntable-light-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve a flickering effect on Santa’s clothing, Balov created a custom texture with different brush strokes in Adobe Photoshop. The texture doubles as an alpha map, which intentionally clips the geometry.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68486-7" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-bozo-balov-wk86-solid-anim-1280w.mp4?_=7" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-bozo-balov-wk86-solid-anim-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-bozo-balov-wk86-solid-anim-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>“When it comes to rendering 3D graphics, nothing really comes close to NVIDIA GPUs.” — Božo Balov</p>
</div>
<p>He then used Adobe Photoshop to paint monochromatic background layers. Balov’s GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU unlocked over 30 GPU-accelerated features, including blur gallery, liquify, smart sharpen and perspective warp.</p>
<p>Balov then converted the files to the FBX adaptable file format for 3D software before importing them into Blender, where he animated the layers to move in the opposite direction of the character to create a sense of speed. He kept the lighting fairly simple, with one light source as the base and a few supplemental ones to emphasize specific parts of the scene.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68486-8" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-bozo-balov-wk86-turntable-half-1280w.mp4?_=8" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-bozo-balov-wk86-turntable-half-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-bozo-balov-wk86-turntable-half-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Balov prefers working in Blender’s real-time engine EEVEE to animate his scene, cutting wait times. RTX-accelerated <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ray-tracing/optix">OptiX</a> ray tracing in the viewport enabled greater interactivity with smoother movement, speeding his ideation and creative workflow.</p>

<p>“Rendering is a joy on NVIDIA RTX cards,” said Balov. “Since OptiX made its debut, rendering times have been cut in half or more — Blender Cycles feels like a real-time engine.”</p>
<p>When asked for advice to give aspiring artists, Balov emphasized the importance of individual passion.</p>
<p>“Pursue what matters to you,” he said. “Don’t spend time fulfilling other people’s ideas of what art should be.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>To enhance the gaming experience, studios and developers spend tremendous effort creating photorealistic, immersive in-game environments.</p>
<p>But non-playable characters (NPCs) often get left behind. Many behave in ways that lack depth and realism, making their interactions repetitive and forgettable.</p>
<p><a href="https://inworld.ai/">Inworld AI</a> is changing the game by using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> to drive NPC behaviors that are dynamic and responsive to player actions. The Mountain View, Calif.-based startup’s Character Engine, which can be used with any character design, is helping studios and developers enhance gameplay and improve player engagement.</p>
<h2><b>Elevate Gaming Experiences: Achievement Unlocked</b></h2>
<p>The Inworld team aims to develop AI-powered NPCs that can learn, adapt and build relationships with players while delivering high-quality performance and maintaining in-game immersion.</p>
<p>To make it easier for developers to integrate AI-based NPCs into their games, Inworld built Character Engine, which uses generative AI running on NVIDIA technology to create immersive, interactive characters. It’s built to be production-ready, scalable and optimized for real-time experiences.</p>
<p>The Character Engine comprises three layers: Character Brain, Contextual Mesh and Real-Time AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://inworld.ai/character-brain"><b>Character Brain</b></a> orchestrates a character’s performance by syncing to its multiple personality <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/machine-learning/">machine learning</a> models, such as for text-to-speech, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/essential-guide-to-automatic-speech-recognition-technology/">automatic speech recognition</a>, emotions, gestures and animations.</p>
<p>The layer also enables AI-based NPCs to learn and adapt, navigate relationships and perform motivated actions. For example, users can create triggers using the “Goals and Action” feature to program NPCs to behave in a certain way in response to a given player input.</p>
<p><a href="https://inworld.ai/contextual-mesh"><b>Contextual Mesh</b></a> allows developers to set parameters for content and safety mechanisms, custom knowledge and narrative controls. Game developers can use the “Relationships” feature to create emergent narratives, such that an ally can turn into an enemy or vice versa based on how players treat an NPC.</p>
<p>One big challenge developers face when using generative AI is keeping NPCs in-world and on-message. Inworld’s Contextual Mesh layer helps overcome this hurdle by rendering characters within the logic and fantasy of their worlds, effectively avoiding the hallucinations that commonly appear when using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">large language models</a> (LLMs).</p>
<p>The Real-Time AI layer ensures optimal performance and scalability for real-time experiences.</p>

<h2><b>Powering Up AI Workflows With NVIDIA </b></h2>
<p>Inworld, a member of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a> program, which supports startups through every stage of their development, uses <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/triton-inference-server/">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a> as integral parts of its generative AI training and deployment infrastructure.</p>
<p>Inworld used the open-source NVIDIA Triton Inference Server software to standardize other non-generative machine learning model deployments required to power Character Brain features, such as emotions. The startup also plans to use the open-source <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt#inference">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a> library to optimize inference performance. Both NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and TensorRT-LLM are available with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform, which provides security, stability and support for production AI.</p>
<p>Inworld also used NVIDIA A100 GPUs within <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/slurm">Slurm</a>-managed bare-metal machines for its production training pipelines. Similar machines wrapped in <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/kubernetes-gpu">Kubernetes</a> help manage character interactions during gameplay. This setup delivers real-time generative AI at the lowest possible cost.</p>
<p>“We chose to use NVIDIA A100 GPUs because they provided the best, most cost-efficient option for our machine learning workloads compared to other solutions,” said Igor Poletaev, vice president of AI at Inworld.</p>
<p>“Our customers and partners are looking to find novel and innovative ways to drive player engagement metrics by integrating AI NPC functionalities into their gameplay,” said Poletaev. “There’s no way to achieve real-time performance without hardware accelerators, which is why we required GPUs to be integrated into our backend architecture from the very beginning.”</p>

<p>Inworld’s generative AI-powered NPCs have enabled dynamic, evergreen gaming experiences that keep players coming back. Developers and gamers alike have reported enhanced player engagement, satisfaction and retention.</p>
<p>Inworld has powered AI-based NPC experiences from Niantic, LG UPlus, Alpine Electronics and more. One open-world virtual reality game using the Inworld Character Engine saw a 5% increase in playtime, while a detective-themed indie game garnered over $300,000 in free publicity after some of the most popular Twitch streamers discovered it.</p>
