										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>In celebration of <a href="https://zoox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoox</a>’s 10th anniversary, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang recently joined the robotaxi company’s CEO, Aicha Evans, and its cofounder and CTO, Jesse Levinson, to discuss the latest in autonomous vehicle (AV) innovation and experience a ride in the Zoox robotaxi.</p>
<p>In a fireside chat at Zoox’s headquarters in Foster City, Calif., the trio reflected on the two companies’ decade of collaboration. Evans and Levinson highlighted how Zoox pioneered the concept of a robotaxi purpose-built for ride-hailing and created groundbreaking innovations along the way, using NVIDIA technology.</p>
<p>“The world has never seen a robotics company like this before,” said Huang. “Zoox started out solely as a sustainable robotics company that delivers robots into the world as a fleet.”</p>
<p>Since 2014, Zoox has been on a mission to create fully autonomous, bidirectional vehicles purpose-built for ride-hailing services. This sets it apart in an industry largely focused on retrofitting existing cars with self-driving technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-73440" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1-672x448.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="448" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1-672x448.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1-675x450.jpg 675w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1-323x215.jpg 323w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image3-1.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>A decade later, the company is operating <a href="https://zoox.com/vehicle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its robotaxi</a>, powered by NVIDIA GPUs, on public roads.</p>
<h2><b>Computing at the Core</b></h2>
<p>Zoox robotaxis are, at their core, supercomputers on wheels. They’re built on multiple NVIDIA GPUs dedicated to processing the enormous amounts of data generated in real time by their sensors.</p>
<p>The sensor array includes cameras, lidar, radar, long-wave infrared sensors and microphones. The onboard computing system rapidly processes the raw sensor data collected and fuses it to provide a coherent understanding of the vehicle’s surroundings.</p>
<p>The processed data then flows through a <a href="https://zoox.com/journal/perception/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception engine</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/how-the-zoox-robotaxi-predicts-everything-everywhere-all-at-once" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prediction module</a> to <a href="https://zoox.com/journal/planner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning</a> and control systems, enabling the vehicle to navigate complex urban environments safely.</p>
<p>NVIDIA GPUs deliver the immense computing power required for the Zoox robotaxis’ autonomous capabilities and continuous learning from new experiences.</p>
<h2><b>Using Simulation as a Virtual Proving Ground</b></h2>
<p>Key to Zoox’s AV development process is its extensive use of simulation. The company uses NVIDIA GPUs and software tools to run a wide array of simulations, testing its autonomous systems in virtual environments before real-world deployment.</p>
<p>These simulations range from synthetic scenarios to replays of real-world scenarios created using data collected from test vehicles. Zoox uses retrofitted Toyota Highlanders equipped with the same sensor and compute packages as its robotaxis to gather driving data and validate its autonomous technology.</p>
<p>This data is then fed back into simulation environments, where it can be used to create countless variations and replays of scenarios and agent interactions.</p>
<p>Zoox also uses what it calls “adversarial simulations,” carefully crafted scenarios designed to test the limits of the autonomous systems and uncover potential edge cases.</p>
<p>The company’s comprehensive approach to simulation allows it to rapidly iterate and improve its autonomous driving software, bolstering AV safety and performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-73443 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1-672x368.png" alt="" width="672" height="368" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1-672x368.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1-400x219.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1-768x420.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1-822x450.png 822w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1-393x215.png 393w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1-183x100.png 183w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1.png 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>“We’ve been using NVIDIA hardware since the very start,” said Levinson. “It’s a huge part of our simulator, and we rely on NVIDIA GPUs in the vehicle to process everything around us in real time.”</p>
<h2><b>A Neat Way to Seat</b></h2>
<p>Zoox’s robotaxi, with its unique bidirectional design and <a href="https://zoox.com/journal/robotaxi-carriage-seating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carriage-style seating</a>, is optimized for autonomous operation and passenger comfort, eliminating traditional concepts of a car’s “front” and “back” and providing equal comfort and safety for all occupants.</p>
<p>“I came to visit you when you were zero years old, and the vision was compelling,” Huang said, reflecting on Zoox’s evolution over the years. “The challenge was incredible. The technology, the talent — it is all world-class.”</p>
<p>Using NVIDIA GPUs and tools, Zoox is poised to redefine urban mobility, pioneering a future of safe, efficient and sustainable autonomous transportation for all.</p>
<h2><b>From Testing Miles to Market Projections</b></h2>
<p>As the AV industry gains momentum, recent projections highlight the potential for explosive growth in the robotaxi market. <a href="https://guidehouseinsights.com/reports/what-is-the-pathway-to-sustainability-for-as-a-service-business-models-in-transportation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidehouse Insights</a> forecasts over 5 million robotaxi deployments by 2030, with numbers expected to surge to almost 34 million by 2035.</p>
<p>The regulatory landscape reflects this progress, with 38 companies currently holding valid permits to test AVs with safety drivers in California. Zoox is currently one of only six companies permitted to test AVs without safety drivers in the state.</p>
<p>As the industry advances, Zoox has created a next-generation robotaxi by combining cutting-edge onboard computing with extensive simulation and development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>NVIDIA researchers used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/picasso/">NVIDIA Edify</a>, a multimodal architecture for visual generative AI, to build a detailed 3D desert landscape within a few minutes in a live demo at SIGGRAPH’s <a target="_blank" href="https://s2024.siggraph.org/program/real-time-live/">Real-Time Live</a> event on Tuesday.</p>
<p>During the event — one of the prestigious graphics conference’s top sessions — NVIDIA researchers showed how, with the support of an AI agent, they could build and edit a desert landscape from scratch within five minutes. The live demo highlighted how generative AI can act as an assistant to artists by accelerating ideation and generating custom secondary assets that would otherwise have been sourced from a repository.</p>
<p>By drastically decreasing ideation time, these AI technologies will empower 3D artists to be more productive and creative — giving them the tools to explore concepts faster and expedite parts of their workflows. They could, for example, generate the background assets or 360 HDRi environments that the scene needs in minutes, instead of spending hours finding or creating them.</p>
<h2><b>From Idea to 3D Scene in Three Minutes</b></h2>
<p>Creating a full 3D scene is a complex, time-consuming task. Artists must support their hero asset with plenty of background objects to create a rich scene, then find an appropriate background and an environment map to light it. Due to time constraints, they’ve often had to make a trade-off between rapid results and creative exploration.</p>
<p>With the support of AI agents, creative teams can achieve both goals: quickly bring concepts to life and continue iterating to achieve the right look.</p>
<p>In the Real-Time Live demo, the researchers used an AI agent to instruct an NVIDIA Edify-powered model to generate dozens of 3D assets, including cacti, rocks and the skull of a bull — with previews produced in just seconds.</p>
<p>They next directed the agent to harness other models to create potential backgrounds and a layout of how the objects would be placed in the scene — and showcased how the agent could adapt to last-minute changes in creative direction by quickly swapping the rocks for gold nuggets.</p>
<p>With a design plan in place, they prompted the agent to create full-quality assets and render the scene as a photorealistic image in <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/composer/latest/index.html">NVIDIA Omniverse USD Composer</a>, an app for virtual world-building.</p>

<h2><b>NVIDIA Edify Accelerates Environment Generation </b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA Edify models can help creators focus on hero assets while accelerating the creation of background environments and objects using AI-powered scene generation tools. The Real-Time Live demo showcased two Edify models: <b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Edify 3D</b> generates ready-to-edit 3D meshes from text or image prompts. Within seconds, the model can generate previews, including rotating animations of each object, to help creators rapidly prototype before committing to a specific design.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Edify 360 HDRi</b> uses text or image prompts to generate up to 16K high-dynamic range images (HDRi) of nature landscapes, which can be used as backgrounds and to light scenes.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the demo, the researchers also showcased an AI agent powered by a large language model, and <b>USD Layout</b>, an AI model that generates scene layouts using OpenUSD, a platform for 3D workflows.</p>
<p>At SIGGRAPH, NVIDIA also announced that two leading creative content companies are giving designers and artists new ways to boost productivity with generative AI using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/edify-shutterstock-getty-images/">tools powered by NVIDIA Edify</a>.</p>
<p>Shutterstock has launched in commercial beta its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/discover/generative-ai-3d">Generative 3D</a> service, which lets creators quickly prototype and generate 3D assets using text or image prompts. Its 360 HDRi generator based on Edify also entered early access.</p>
<p>Getty Images updated its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/ai/generation/about">Generative AI by Getty Images</a> service with the latest version of NVIDIA Edify. Users can now create images twice as fast, with improved output quality and prompt adherence, and advanced controls and fine-tuning.</p>
<h2><b>Harnessing Universal Scene Description in NVIDIA Omniverse</b></h2>
<p>The 3D objects, environment maps and layouts generated using Edify models are structured with USD, a standard format for describing and composing 3D worlds. This compatibility allows artists to immediately import Edify-powered creations into Omniverse USD Composer.</p>
<p>Within Composer, they can use popular digital content creation tools to further modify the scene by, for example, changing the position of objects, modifying their appearance or adjusting lighting.</p>
<p>Real-Time Live is one of the most anticipated events at SIGGRAPH, featuring about a dozen real-time applications including generative AI, virtual reality and live performance capture technology. Watch the replay below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>In a highly anticipated fireside chat at SIGGRAPH 2024, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang and Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed the transformative potential of open source AI and AI assistants.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg kicked off the discussion by announcing the launch of <a target="_blank" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/create-your-own-custom-ai-with-ai-studio/">AI Studio</a>, a new platform that allows users to create, share and discover AI characters, making AI more accessible to millions of creators and small businesses.</p>
<p>“Every single restaurant, every single website will probably, in the future, have these AIs …” Huang said.</p>
<p>“&#8230;just like every business has an email address and a website and a social media account, I think, in the future, every business is going to have an AI,” Zuckerberg responded.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg has gotten it right before. Huang credited Zuckerberg and Meta with being leaders in AI, even if only some have noticed until recently.</p>
<p>“You guys have done amazing AI work,” Huang said, citing advancements from Meta in computer vision, language models, real-time translation. “We all use Pytorch, that comes out of Meta.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-cmMcMZoZ4?si=n6m8GTto3u69RW1_" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
<b>The Importance of Open Source in Advancing AI</b><b><br />
</b><br />
Zuckerberg highlighted the importance of open source in advancing AI — with the two business leaders emphasizing the importance of open platforms for innovation. <b><br />
</b><br />
Meta has rapidly emerged as a leader in AI, putting it to work throughout its businesses — most notably with Meta AI, which is used across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — and advancing open-source AI throughout the industry, most recently with the release of Llama 3.1.</p>
<p>The open-source model represents a significant investment of time and training resources. The largest version of Llama boasts 405 billion parameters and was trained on over 16,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs.</p>
<p>“One of the things that drives quality improvements is it used to be that you have a different model for each type of content,” Zuckerberg explained.</p>
<p>“As the models get bigger and more general, that gets better and better. So, I kind of dream of one day like you can almost imagine all of Facebook or Instagram being like a single AI model that has unified all these different content types and systems together,” he added.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg sees collaboration as key to more advancements. In a blog post released last week, Zuckerberg wrote that the release of Llama 3.1 promises to be an “inflection point” in adopting open source in AI.</p>
<p>These advancements promise more tools to foster engagement, create compelling and personalized content — such as digital avatars — and build virtual worlds.</p>
<p>More broadly, the advancement of AI across a broad ecosystem promises to supercharge human productivity, for example, by giving every human on earth a digital assistant — or assistants — allowing people to live richer lives that they can interact with quickly and fluidly.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m collaborating with WhatsApp,” Huang said. “Imagine I’m sitting here typing, and it’s generating the images as I’m going. I go back and change my words, and it’s generating other images.”</p>
<p><b>Vision for the Future</b></p>
<p>Looking ahead, both CEOs shared their visions for the future.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg expressed optimism about bringing AI together with the real world through eyeglasses — noting his company’s collaboration with eyewear maker Luxottica — that can be used to help transform education, entertainment and work.</p>
<p>Huang emphasized how interacting with AIs is becoming more fluid, moving beyond just text-based interactions.</p>
<p>“Today’s AI is kind of turn-based. You say something, it says something back to you,” Huang said. In the future, AI could contemplate multiple options, or come up with a tree of options and simulate outcomes, making it much more powerful.”</p>
<p>Throughout the conversation, the two leaders playfully bantered about everything from fashion to steak sandwiches, ending the discussion by exchanging leather jackets.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg gave Huang a black leather shearling jacket with an enormous hood.</p>
<p>Huang gave Zuckerberg his own leather jacket, which he got from his wife, Lori, just for SIGGRAPH, quipping that it was just “two hours old.”</p>
<p>“Well this one’s yours,” Zuckerberg said with a smile. “This is worth more because it’s used.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>The generative AI revolution — with deep roots in visual computing — is amplifying human creativity even as accelerated computing promises significant gains in energy efficiency, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said Monday.</p>
<p>That makes this week&#8217;s SIGGRAPH professional graphics conference, in Denver, the logical venue to discuss what’s next.</p>
<p>“Everybody will have an AI assistant,” Huang said. “Every single company, every single job within the company, will have AI assistance.”</p>
<p>But even as generative AI promises to amplify human productivity, Huang said the accelerated computing technology that underpins it promises to make computing more energy efficient.</p>
<p>“Accelerated computing helps you save so much energy, 20 times, 50 times, and doing the same processing,” Huang said. “The first thing we have to do, as a society, is accelerate every application we can: this reduces the amount of energy being used all over the world.”</p>

<p>The conversation follows a spate of announcements from NVIDIA today.</p>
<p><a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-generative-ai-models-and-nim-microservices-for-openusd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA introduced a new suite of NIM microservices</a> tailored for diverse workflows, including OpenUSD, 3D modeling, physics, materials, robotics, industrial digital twins and physical AI.<br />
These advancements aim to enhance developer capabilities, particularly with the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/hugging-face-inference-nim-microservices-dgx-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integration of Hugging Face Inference-as-a-Service on DGX Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/edify-shutterstock-getty-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock has launched a Generative 3D Service</a>, while <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/edify-shutterstock-getty-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getty Images has upgraded its offerings using NVIDIA Edify technology</a>.</p>
<p>In the realm of AI and graphics, NVIDIA has revealed new <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-physical-ai-nim-microservices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenUSD NIM microservices and reference workflows</a> designed for generative physical AI applications.</p>
<p>This includes a <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-accelerates-worldwide-humanoid-robotics-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">program for accelerating humanoid robotics development</a> through new NIM microservices for robotics simulation and more.</p>
<p>Finally, WPP, the world&#8217;s largest advertising agency, is using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/coca-cola-wpp-omniverse-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omniverse-driven generative AI for The Coca-Cola Company</a>, helping drive brand authenticity, and showcasing the practical applications of NVIDIA’s advancements in AI technology across various industries.</p>
<p>Huang and Goode started their conversation by exploring how visual computing gave rise to everything from computer games to digital animation to GPU-accelerated computing and, most recently, generative AI powered by industrial-scale AI factories.</p>
<p>All these advancements build on one another. Robotics, for example, requires advanced AI and photorealistic virtual worlds where AI can be trained before being deployed into next-generation humanoid robots.</p>
<p>Huang explained that robotics requires three computers: one to train the AI, one to test the AI in a physically accurate simulation, and one within the robot itself.</p>
<p>“Just about every industry is going to be affected by this, whether it’s scientific computing trying to do a better job predicting the weather with a lot less energy, to augmenting and collaborating with creators to generate images, or generating virtual scenes for industrial visualization,” Huang said. “Robotic self-driving cars are all going to be transformed by generative AI.”</p>
<p>Likewise, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Omniverse systems</a> — built around the OpenUSD standard — will also be key to harnessing generative AI to create assets that the world’s largest brands can use.</p>
<p>By pulling from brand assets that live in Omniverse, which can capture brand assets, these systems can capture and replicate carefully curated brand magic.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-73392" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1-672x357.png" alt="" width="672" height="357" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1-672x357.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1-400x213.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1-768x408.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1-842x447.png 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1-406x215.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1-188x100.png 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PJ_B0494-blog-press-1280x680-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, all these systems — visual computing, simulation and large-language models — will come together to create digital humans who can help people interact with digital systems of all kinds.</p>
<p>“One of the things that we’re announcing here this week is the concept of digital agents, digital AIs that will augment every single job in the company,” Huang said.</p>
<p>“And so one of the most important use cases that people are discovering is customer service,” Huang said. “In the future, my guess is that it’s going to be human still, but AI in the loop.”</p>
<p>All of this, like any new tool, promises to amplify human productivity and creativity. “Imagine the stories that you’re going to be able to tell with these tools,” Huang said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>When The Coca-Cola Company produces thirst-quenching marketing, the creative elements of campaigns aren’t just left to chance — there’s a recipe for the magic. Now, the beverage company, through its partnership with WPP Open X, is beginning to scale its global campaigns with generative AI from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> microservices.</p>
<p>“With NVIDIA, we can personalize and customize Coke and meals imagery across 100-plus markets, delivering on hyperlocal relevance with speed and at global scale,” said Samir Bhutada, global vice president of StudioX Digital Transformation at The Coca-Cola Company.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola has been working with WPP to develop <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/">digital twin</a> tools and roll out Prod X — a custom production studio experience created specifically for the beverage maker to use globally.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wpp.com/news/2024/07/wpp-to-create-generative-3d-worlds-in-collaboration-with-nvidia">WPP announced</a> today at SIGGRAPH that The Coca-Cola Company will be an early adopter for integrating the <a target="_blank" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-generative-ai-models-and-nim-microservices-for-openusd">new NVIDIA NIM microservices</a> for Universal Scene Description (aka OpenUSD) into its Prod X roadmap. <a target="_blank" href="https://aousd.org/blog/explainer-series-what-is-openusd/">OpenUSD</a> is a 3D framework that enables interoperability between software tools and data types for building virtual worlds. NIM inference microservices provide models as optimized containers.</p>
<p>The USD Search NIM allows WPP to tap into a large archive of models to create on-brand assets, and the USD Code NIM can be used to assemble them into scenes.</p>
<p>These NIM microservices will enable Prod X users to create 3D advertising assets that contain culturally relevant elements on a global scale, using prompt engineering to quickly make adjustments to AI-generated images so that brands can better target their products at local markets.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="BTS: how WPP is creating generative 3D worlds using NVIDIA NIM microservices" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-vsX-NzHzw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Tapping Into NVIDIA NIM Microservices to Deploy Generative AI </b></h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/media-and-entertainment/wpp/">WPP</a> said that the NVIDIA NIM microservices will have a lasting impact on the 3D engineering and art world.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/usdsearch">USD Search NIM</a> can make WPP’s massive visual asset libraries quickly available via written prompts. The <a target="_blank" href="https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/usdcode-llama3-70b-instruct">USD Code NIM</a> allows developers to enter prompts and get Python code to create novel 3D worlds.</p>
<p>“The beauty of the solution is that it compresses multiple phases of the production process into a single interface and process,” said Perry Nightingale, senior vice president of creative AI at WPP, of the new NIM microservices. “It empowers artists to get more out of the technology and create better work.”</p>
<h2><b>Redefining Content Production With Production Studio</b></h2>
<p>WPP recently announced the release of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wpp.com/news/2024/06/wpp-unveils-ai-powered-production-studio">Production Studio</a> on WPP Open, the company’s intelligent marketing operating system powered by AI. Co-developed with its production company, Hogarth, Production Studio taps into the Omniverse development platform and OpenUSD for its generative AI-enabled <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/use-cases/3d-product-configurator/">product configurator</a> workflows.</p>
<p>Production Studio can streamline and automate multilingual text, image and video creation, simplifying content creation for advertisers and marketers, and directly addresses the challenges advertisers continue to face in producing brand-compliant and product-accurate content at scale.</p>
<p>“Our groundbreaking research with NVIDIA Omniverse for the past few years, and the research and development associated with having built our own core USD pipeline and decades of experience in 3D workflows, is what made it possible for us to stand up a tailored experience like this for The Coca-Cola Company,” said Priti Mhatre, managing director for strategic consulting and AI at Hogarth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>NVIDIA announced at SIGGRAPH <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/fvdb">fVDB</a>, a new deep-learning framework for generating AI-ready virtual representations of the real world.</p>
<p>fVDB is built on top of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openvdb.org/">OpenVDB</a>, the industry-standard library for simulating and rendering sparse volumetric data such as water, fire, smoke and clouds.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-physical-ai/">Generative physical AI</a>, such as autonomous vehicles and robots that inhabit the real world, need to have “spatial intelligence” — the ability to understand and operate in 3D space.</p>
<p>Capturing the large scale and super-fine details of the world around us is essential. But converting reality into a virtual representation to train AI is hard.</p>
<p>Raw data for real-world environments can be collected through many different techniques, like neural radiance fields (<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/neural-radiance-fields-3d-models/">NeRFs</a>) and lidar. fVDB translates this data into massive, AI-ready environments rendered in real time.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Train Physical AI With Real-World Simulations Using fVDB." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rx55wDWqSrw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Building on a decade of innovation in the OpenVDB standard, the introduction of<a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01781"> fVDB</a> at SIGGRAPH represents a significant leap forward in how industries can benefit from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/">digital twins</a> of the real world.</p>
<p>Reality-scale virtual environments are used for training autonomous agents. City-scale 3D models are captured by drones for climate science and disaster planning. Today, 3D generative AI is even used to plan urban spaces and smart cities.</p>
<p>fVDB enables industries to tap into spatial intelligence on a larger scale and with higher resolution than ever before, making physical AI even smarter.</p>
<p>The framework builds NVIDIA-accelerated AI operators on top of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nanovdb">NanoVDB</a>, a GPU-accelerated data structure for efficient 3D simulations. These operators include convolution, pooling, attention and meshing, all of which are designed for high-performance 3D deep learning applications.</p>
<p>AI operators allow businesses to build complex neural networks for spatial intelligence, like large-scale point cloud reconstruction and 3D generative modeling.</p>
<p>fVDB is the result of a long-running effort by NVIDIA’s research team and is already used to support <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/">NVIDIA Research</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/drive">NVIDIA DRIVE</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> projects that require high-fidelity models of large, complex real-world spaces.</p>
<h2><b>Key Advantages of fVDB</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">Larger: 4x larger spatial scale than prior frameworks</li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">Faster: 3.5x faster than prior frameworks</li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">Interoperable: Businesses can fully tap into massive real-world datasets. fVDB reads VDB datasets into full-sized 3D environments. AI-ready and real-time rendered for building physical AI with spatial intelligence.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">More powerful: 10x more operators than prior frameworks. fVDB simplifies processes by combining functionalities that previously required multiple deep-learning libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>fVDB will soon be available as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> inference microservices. A trio of the microservices will enable businesses to incorporate fVDB into <a target="_blank" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-expands-openusd-to-generative-ai-for-robotics-industrial-digitalization-markets">OpenUSD workflows</a>, generating AI-ready OpenUSD geometry in NVIDIA Omniverse, a development platform for industrial digitalization and generative physical AI applications. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">fVDB Mesh Generation NIM — Generates digital 3D environments of the real world</li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">fVDB NeRF-XL NIM — Generates large-scale NeRFs in OpenUSD using Omniverse Cloud APIs</li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1">fVDB Physics Super-Res NIM — Performs super-resolution to generate an OpenUSD-based, high-resolution physics simulation</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past decade, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openvdb.org/about/">OpenVDB</a>, housed at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aswf.io/blog/fvdb/">Academy Software Foundation</a>, has earned multiple <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/academy-awards-vfx-openusd/">Academy Awards</a> as a core technology used throughout the visual-effects industry. It has since grown beyond entertainment to industrial and scientific uses, like industrial design and robotics.</p>
<p>NVIDIA continues to enhance the open-source OpenVDB library. Four years ago, the company introduced <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nanovdb">NanoVDB</a>, which added GPU support to OpenVDB. This delivered an order-of-magnitude speed-up, enabling faster performance and easier development, and opening the door to real-time simulation and rendering.</p>
<p>Two years ago, NVIDIA introduced <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rendering-technologies/neuralvdb">NeuralVDB</a>, which builds machine learning on top of NanoVDB to compress the memory footprint of VDB volumes up to 100x, allowing creators, developers and researchers to interact with extremely large and complex datasets.</p>
<p>fVDB builds AI operators on top of NanoVDB to unlock spatial intelligence at the scale of reality. Apply to the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/fvdb/early-access-form">early-access program</a> for the fVDB PyTorch extension. fVDB will also be available as part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb">OpenVDB GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dive deeper into <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/building-spatial-intelligence-from-real-world-3d-data-using-deep-learning-framework-fvdb/">fVDB in this technical blog</a> and watch how accelerated computing and generative AI are transforming industries and creating new opportunities for innovation and growth in NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s two <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/siggraph/">fireside chats</a> at SIGGRAPH.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>The world’s brands and agencies are using generative AI to create advertising and marketing content, but it doesn’t always provide the desired outputs.</p>
<p>NVIDIA offers a comprehensive set of technologies — bringing together generative AI, NVIDIA NIM microservices, NVIDIA Omniverse and <a target="_blank" href="https://aousd.org/blog/explainer-series-what-is-openusd/">Universal Scene Description</a> (OpenUSD) — to allow developers to build applications and workflows that enable brand-accurate, targeted and efficient advertising at scale.</p>
<p>Developers can use the <a target="_blank" href="https://build.stg.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia/usdsearch">USD Search NIM microservice to provide artists access to a vast archive of </a>OpenUSD-based, brand-approved assets — such as products, props and environments — <a target="_blank" href="https://build.stg.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia/usdsearch">and</a> when integrated with the <a target="_blank" href="https://build.stg.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia/usdcode-llama3-70b-instruct">USD Code NIM</a> microservice, assembly of these scenes can be accelerated. Teams can also use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/picasso/">NVIDIA Edify</a>-powered <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/edify-shutterstock-getty-images/">Shutterstock Generative 3D</a> service to rapidly generate 3D new assets using AI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>One of the world’s largest AI communities — comprising 4 million developers on the Hugging Face platform — is gaining easy access to NVIDIA-accelerated inference on some of the most popular AI models.</p>
<p>New inference-as-a-service capabilities will enable developers to rapidly deploy leading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language models</a> such as the Llama 3 family and Mistral AI models with optimization from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> microservices running on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Announced today at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/siggraph/">SIGGRAPH</a> conference, the service will help developers quickly prototype with open-source AI models hosted on the Hugging Face Hub and deploy them in production. Enterprise Hub users can tap serverless inference for increased flexibility, minimal infrastructure overhead and optimized performance with NVIDIA NIM.</p>
<p>The inference service complements <a target="_blank" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-hugging-face-to-connect-millions-of-developers-to-generative-ai-supercomputing">Train on DGX Cloud</a>, an AI training service already available on Hugging Face.</p>
<p>Developers facing a growing number of open-source models can benefit from a hub where they can easily compare options. These training and inference tools give Hugging Face developers new ways to experiment with, test and deploy cutting-edge models on NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure. They’re made easily accessible using the “Train” and “Deploy” drop-down menus on Hugging Face model cards, letting users get started with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>Get started with <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/inference-dgx-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inference-as-a-service powered by NVIDIA NIM</a>.</p>
<p><b>Beyond a Token Gesture — NVIDIA NIM Brings Big Benefits</b></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> is a collection of AI microservices — including NVIDIA AI foundation models and open-source community models — optimized for inference using industry-standard application programming interfaces, or APIs.</p>
<p>NIM offers users higher efficiency in processing tokens — the units of data used and generated by a language model. The optimized microservices also improve the efficiency of the underlying NVIDIA DGX Cloud infrastructure, which can increase the speed of critical AI applications.</p>
<p>This means developers see faster, more robust results from an AI model accessed as a NIM compared with other versions of the model.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Millions of people already use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> to assist in writing and learning. Now, the technology can also help them more effectively navigate the physical world.</p>
<p>NVIDIA announced at SIGGRAPH <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-physical-ai">generative physical AI</a> advancements including the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/use-cases/visual-ai-agents/">NVIDIA Metropolis reference workflow</a> for building interactive visual AI agents and new NVIDIA NIM microservices that will help developers train physical machines and improve how they handle complex tasks.</p>
<p>These include <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/fvdb-bigger-digital-models/">three fVDB NIM microservices</a> that support NVIDIA’s new deep learning framework for 3D worlds, as well as the <a target="_blank" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-expands-openusd-to-generative-ai-for-robotics-industrial-digitalization-markets">USD Code, USD Search and USD Validate NIM microservices</a> for working with Universal Scene Description (aka <a target="_blank" href="https://aousd.org/blog/explainer-series-what-is-openusd/">OpenUSD</a>).</p>
<p>The NVIDIA OpenUSD NIM microservices work together with the world’s first generative AI models for OpenUSD development — also developed by NVIDIA — to enable developers to <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/integrate-generative-ai-into-openusd-workflows-using-new-nvidia-omniverse-developer-tools/">incorporate generative AI copilots and agents into USD workflows</a> and broaden the possibilities of 3D worlds.</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA NIM Microservices Transform Physical AI Landscapes</b></h2>
<p>Physical AI uses advanced simulations and learning methods to help robots and other industrial automation more effectively perceive, reason and navigate their surroundings. The technology is transforming industries like manufacturing and healthcare, and advancing smart spaces with robots, factory and warehouse technologies, surgical AI agents and cars that can operate more autonomously and precisely.</p>
<p>NVIDIA offers a broad range of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NIM microservices</a> customized for specific models and industry domains. NVIDIA’s suite of NIM microservices tailored for physical AI supports capabilities for speech and translation, vision and intelligence, and realistic animation and behavior.</p>
<h2><b>Turning Visual AI Agents Into Visionaries With NVIDIA NIM</b></h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/use-cases/visual-ai-agents/">Visual AI agents</a> use computer vision capabilities to perceive and interact with the physical world and perform reasoning tasks.</p>
<p>Highly perceptive and interactive visual AI agents are powered by a new class of generative AI models called <a target="_blank" href="https://build.nvidia.com/explore/vision">vision language models (VLMs)</a>, which bridge digital perception and real-world interaction in physical AI workloads to enable enhanced decision-making, accuracy, interactivity and performance. With VLMs, developers can build vision AI agents that can more effectively handle challenging tasks, even in complex environments.</p>
<p>Generative AI-powered visual AI agents are rapidly being deployed across hospitals, factories, warehouses, retail stores, airports, traffic intersections and more.</p>
<p>To help physical AI developers more easily build high-performing, custom visual AI agents, NVIDIA offers NIM microservices and reference workflows for physical AI. The NVIDIA Metropolis reference workflow provides a simple, structured approach for customizing, building and deploying visual AI agents, as detailed in <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/build-vlm-powered-visual-ai-agents-using-nvidia-nim-and-nvidia-via-microservices/">the blog</a>.</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA NIM Helps</b><b> K2K </b><b>Make Palermo More Efficient, Safe and Secure</b></h2>
<p>City traffic managers in Palermo, Italy, deployed visual AI agents using NVIDIA NIM to uncover physical insights that help them better manage roadways.</p>

<p>Leading global electronics giants <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/foxconn-digital-twin-ai/">Foxconn</a> and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/computex-metropolis-nim/">Pegatron</a> have adopted physical AI, NIM microservices and Metropolis reference workflows to more efficiently design and run their massive manufacturing operations.</p>
<p>The companies are building <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/use-cases/ai-for-virtual-factory-solutions/">virtual factories</a> in simulation to save significant time and costs. They’re also running more thorough tests and refinements for their physical AI — including AI multi-camera and visual AI agents — in digital twins before real-world deployment, improving worker safety and leading to operational efficiencies.</p>
<h2><b>Bridging the Simulation-to-Reality Gap With Synthetic Data Generation</b></h2>
<p>Many AI-driven businesses are now adopting a “simulation-first” approach for generative physical AI projects involving real-world industrial automation.</p>
<p>Manufacturing, factory logistics and robotics companies need to manage intricate human-worker interactions, advanced facilities and expensive equipment. NVIDIA physical AI software, tools and platforms — including physical AI and VLM NIM microservices, reference workflows and <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/fVDB">fVDB</a> — can help them streamline the highly complex engineering required to create digital representations or virtual environments that accurately mimic real-world conditions.</p>
<p>VLMs are seeing widespread adoption across industries because of their ability to generate highly realistic imagery. However, these models can be challenging to train because of the immense volume of data required to create an accurate physical AI model.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/">Synthetic data</a> generated from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/">digital twins</a> using computer simulations offers a powerful alternative to real-world datasets, which can be expensive — and sometimes impossible — to acquire for model training, depending on the use case.</p>
<p>Tools like NVIDIA NIM microservices and <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_replicator.html">Omniverse Replicator</a> let developers <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/how-to-build-a-generative-ai-enabled-synthetic-data-pipeline-with-openusd/">build generative AI-enabled synthetic data pipelines</a> to accelerate the creation of robust, diverse datasets for training physical AI. This enhances the adaptability and performance of models such as VLMs, enabling them to generalize more effectively across industries and use cases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Designers and artists have new and improved ways to boost their productivity with generative AI trained on licensed data.</p>
<p>Shutterstock, a leading platform for creative content, launched its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/discover/generative-ai-3d">Generative 3D service</a> in commercial beta. It lets creators quickly prototype 3D assets and generate 360 HDRi backgrounds that light scenes, using just text or image prompts.</p>
<p>Getty Images, a premier visual content creator and marketplace, turbocharged its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/ai/generation/about">Generative AI by Getty Images</a> service so it creates images twice as fast, improves output quality, brings advanced controls and enables fine-tuning.</p>
<p>The services are built with NVIDIA’s visual AI foundry using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/picasso/">NVIDIA Edify</a>, a multimodal generative AI architecture. The AI models are then optimized and packaged for maximum performance with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a>, a set of accelerated microservices for AI inference.</p>
<p>Edify enables service providers to train responsible generative models on their licensed data and scale them quickly with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/">NVIDIA DGX Cloud</a>, the cloud-first way to get the best of NVIDIA AI.</p>
<h2><b>Generative AI Speeds 3D Modeling</b></h2>
<p>Available now for enterprises in commercial beta, Shutterstock’s service lets designers and artists quickly create 3D objects that help them prototype or populate virtual environments. For example, tapping generative AI, they can quickly create the silverware and plates on a dining room table so they can focus on designing the characters around it.</p>
<p>The 3D assets the service generates are ready to edit using digital content creation tools, and available in a variety of popular file formats. Their clean geometry and layout gives artists an advanced starting point for adding their own flair.</p>
<div class="mceTemp"></div>
<figure id="attachment_73330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73330" style="width: 1080px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-73330 size-full" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/chairmesh.gif" alt="" width="1080" height="608" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-73330" class="wp-caption-text">An example of a 3D mesh from Shutterstock Generative 3D.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The AI model first delivers a preview of a single asset in as little as 10 seconds. If users like it, the preview can be turned into a higher-quality 3D asset, complete with physically based rendering materials like concrete, wood or leather.</p>
<p>At this year’s <a target="_blank" href="https://s2024.siggraph.org/">SIGGRAPH</a> computer graphics conference, designers will see just how fast they can make their ideas come to life.</p>
<p>Shutterstock will demo a workflow in Blender that lets artists generate objects directly within their 3D environment. In the Shutterstock booth at SIGGRAPH, HP will show 3D prints and physical prototypes of the kinds of assets attendees can design on the show floor using Generative 3D.</p>
<p>Shutterstock is also working with global marketing and communications services company <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/media-and-entertainment/wpp/">WPP</a> to bring ideas to life with Edify 3D generation for virtual production (see video below).</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA Shutterstock Gen3D" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/983328464?h=2a6e6255af&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write"></iframe></p>
<p>Explore Generative 3D by Shutterstock on the company’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/discover/generative-ai-3d">website</a>, or test-drive the application programming interface (API) at <a target="_blank" href="http://build.nvidia.com/shutterstock/edify-shutterstock-3d-txt23d-2pt7b">build.nvidia.com/</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Virtual Lighting Gets Real</b></h2>
<p>Lighting a virtual scene with accurate reflections can be a complicated task. Creatives need to operate expensive 360-degree camera rigs and go on set to create backgrounds from scratch, or search vast libraries for something that approximates what they want.</p>
<p>With Shutterstock’s Generative 3D service, users can now simply describe the exact environment they need in text or with an image, and out comes a high-dynamic-range panoramic image, aka 360 HDRi, in brilliant 16K resolution. (See video below.)</p>
<div style="width: 960px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-73113-2" width="960" height="540" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_HDRi_SD_30fps_fast.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_HDRi_SD_30fps_fast.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_HDRi_SD_30fps_fast.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>Want that beautiful new sports car shown in a desert, a tropical beach or maybe on a winding mountain road? With generative AI, designers can shift gears fast.</p>
<p>Three companies plan to integrate Shutterstock’s 360 HDRi APIs directly into their workflows — WPP, CGI studio Katana and Dassault Systèmes, developer of the 3DEXCITE applications for creating high-end visualizations and 3D content for virtual worlds.</p>
<figure id="attachment_73327" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73327" style="width: 1400px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-73327" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/genaibygettyimages.gif" alt="" width="1400" height="700" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-73327" class="wp-caption-text">Examples from Generative AI by Getty Images.</figcaption></figure>
<h2><b>Great Images Get a Custom Fit</b></h2>
<p>Generative AI by Getty Images has upgraded to a more powerful Edify AI model with a portfolio of new features that let artists control image composition and style.</p>
<p>Want a red beach ball floating above that perfect shot of a coral reef in Fiji? Getty Images’ service can get it done in a snap.</p>
<p>The new model is twice as fast, boosts image quality and prompt accuracy, and lets users control camera settings like the depth of field or focal length of a shot. Users can generate four images in about six seconds and scale them up to 4K resolution.</p>
<figure id="attachment_73324" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73324" style="width: 1400px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-73324" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Gen-AI-by-Getty-Images-2-camera-controls.jpg" alt="An example of the camera controls in Generative AI by Getty Images." width="1400" height="700" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Gen-AI-by-Getty-Images-2-camera-controls.jpg 1400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Gen-AI-by-Getty-Images-2-camera-controls-400x200.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Gen-AI-by-Getty-Images-2-camera-controls-672x336.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Gen-AI-by-Getty-Images-2-camera-controls-768x384.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Gen-AI-by-Getty-Images-2-camera-controls-842x421.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Gen-AI-by-Getty-Images-2-camera-controls-406x203.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Gen-AI-by-Getty-Images-2-camera-controls-188x94.jpg 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Gen-AI-by-Getty-Images-2-camera-controls-1280x640.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-73324" class="wp-caption-text">An example of the camera controls in Generative AI by Getty Images.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition, the commercially safe <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/">foundational model</a> now serves as the basis for a fine-tuning capability that lets companies customize the AI with their own data. That lets them generate images tailored to the creative style of their specific brands.</p>
<p>New controls in the service support the use of a sketch or depth map to guide the composition or structure of an image.</p>
<p>Creatives at Omnicom, a global leader in marketing and sales solutions, are using Getty Images’ service to streamline advertising workflows and safely create on-brand content. The collaboration with Getty Images is part of Omnicom’s strategy to infuse generative AI into every facet of its business, helping teams move from ideas to outcomes faster.</p>
<p>Generative AI by Getty Images is available through the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/">Getty Images </a>and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/">iStock</a> websites, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/enterprise/contact-sales?form=GI_NVIDIAStrategicParnership">via an API</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of the </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-decoded/"><i>AI Decoded series</i></a><i>, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.</i></p>
<p>Adobe Creative Cloud applications, which tap <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX GPUs</a>, are designed to enhance the creativity of users, empowering them to work faster and focus on their craft.</p>
<p>These tools seamlessly integrate into existing creator workflows, enabling greater productivity and delivering power and precision.</p>
<h2><b>Look to the Light</b></h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/generative-ai-overview.html#generative-ai-with-adobe-creative-cloud">Generative AI</a> creates new data in forms such as images or text by learning from existing data. It effectively visualizes and generates content to match what a user describes and helps open up fresh avenues for creativity.</p>
<p>Adobe Firefly is Adobe’s family of creative generative AI models that offer new ways to ideate and create while assisting creative workflows using generative AI. They’re designed to be safe for commercial use and were trained, using NVIDIA GPUs, on licensed content, like Adobe Stock Images, and public domain content where copyright has expired.</p>

<p>Adobe Photoshop features the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/generative-fill.html">Generative Fill tool,</a> which uses simple description prompts to easily add content from images. With the latest Reference Image feature currently in beta, users can also upload a sample image to get image results closer to their desired output.</p>

<h2><b>Visual Effects</b></h2>
<p>Separating a foreground object from a background is a crucial step in many visual effects and compositing workflows.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects has a new feature that uses a matte to isolate an object, enabling capabilities including background replacement and the selective application of effects to the foreground.</p>
<p>Using the <a target="_blank" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/roto-brush-refine-matte.html">Roto Brush</a> tool, artists can draw strokes on representative areas of the foreground and background elements. After Effects uses that information to create a segmentation boundary between the foreground and background elements, delivering cleaner cutouts with fewer clicks.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How to use Next-Gen Rotobrush 3 in Adobe After Effects" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VJ3cNt0yEhQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Creating 3D Product Shots</b></h2>
<p>The Substance 3D Collection is Adobe’s solution for 3D material authoring, texturing and rendering, enabling users to rapidly create stunningly photorealistic 3D content, including models, materials and lighting.</p>
<p>Visualizing products and designs in the context of a space is compelling, but it can be time-consuming to find the right environment for the objects to live in. Substance 3D Stager’s<a target="_blank" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/substance-3d-stager/features/generative-background.html"> Generative Background</a> feature, powered by Adobe Firefly, solves this issue by letting artists quickly explore generated backgrounds to composite 3D models.</p>
<p>Once an environment is selected, Stager can automatically match the perspective and lighting to the generated background.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Generate Background Images Fast in Substance 3D Stager &amp; Firefly | Adobe Substance 3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/woUUPrSiVPc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Material Authoring With AI</b></h2>
<p>Adobe Substance 3D Sampler, also part of the Substance 3D Collection, is designed to transform images of surfaces and objects into photorealistic physically based rendering (PBR) materials, 3D models and high-dynamic range environment lights. With the recent introduction of<a target="_blank" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/substance-3d-sampler/release-notes/version-4-4---substance-3d-sampler.html"> new generative workflows powered by Adobe Firefly</a>, Sampler is making it easier than ever for artists to explore variations when creating materials for everything from product visualization projects to the latest AAA games.</p>
<p>Sampler’s Text-to-Texture feature allows users to generate tiled images from detailed text prompts. These generated images can then be edited and transformed into photorealistic PBR materials using the machine learning-powered Image-to-Material feature or any Sampler filter.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How to Use Generative Tools in Sampler for Fast Iterations | Adobe Substance 3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YD3tPlO5h3g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Image-to-Texture similarly enables the creation of tiled textures from reference images, providing an alternate way to prompt and generate variations from existing visual content.</p>
<figure id="attachment_73179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73179" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-73179 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture-672x378.png" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture-672x378.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture-400x225.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture-801x450.png 801w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture-383x215.png 383w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture-178x100.png 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-to-texture.png 975w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-73179" class="wp-caption-text">Adobe 3D Sampler’s Image-to-Texture feature.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sampler’s Text-to-Pattern feature uses text prompts to generate tiling patterns, which can be used as base colors or inputs for various filters, such as the Cloth Weave filter for creating original fabric materials.</p>
<p>All of these generative AI features in the Substance 3D Collection, supercharged with RTX GPUs, are designed to help 3D creators ideate and create faster.</p>
<h2><b>Photo-tastic Features</b></h2>
<p>Adobe Lightroom’s AI-powered <a target="_blank" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-cc/using/enhance-details.html">Raw Details</a> feature produces crisp detail and more accurate renditions of edges, improves color rendering and reduces artifacts, enhancing the image without changing its original resolution. This feature is handy for large displays and prints, where fine details are visible.</p>
<figure id="attachment_73182" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73182" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-73182 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance-672x412.png" alt="" width="672" height="412" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance-672x412.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance-400x245.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance-768x471.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance-734x450.png 734w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance-351x215.png 351w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance-163x100.png 163w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Enhance.png 926w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-73182" class="wp-caption-text">Enhance, enhance, enhance.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-cc/using/enhance-details.html">Super Resolution</a> helps create an enhanced image with similar results as Raw Details but with 2x the linear resolution. This means that the enhanced image will have 2x the width and height of the original image — or 4x the total pixel count. This is especially useful for increasing the resolution of cropped imagery.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA RTX Accelerates AI Super Resolution in Adobe Photoshop" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UURFgE43PUg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>For faster editing, AI-powered, RTX-accelerated masking tools like Select Subject, which isolates people from an image, and Select Sky, which captures skies, enable users to create complex masks with the click of a button.</p>

<p>An <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/vector-database/#:~:text=What%20is%20an%20Embedding%20Model%3F">embedding model</a> transforms diverse data — such as text, images, charts and video — into numerical vectors, stored in a vector database, while capturing their meaning and nuance. Embedding models are fast and computationally less expensive than traditional large language models, or LLMs.</p>
<p>A reranking model ingests data and a query, then scores the data according to its relevance to the query. Such models offer significant accuracy improvements while being computationally complex and slower than embedding models.</p>
<p>NeMo Retriever provides the best of both worlds. By casting a wide net of data to be retrieved with an embedding NIM, then using a reranking NIM to trim the results for relevancy, developers tapping NeMo Retriever can build a pipeline that ensures the most helpful, accurate results for their enterprise.</p>
<p>With NeMo Retriever, developers get access to state-of-the-art open, commercial models for building text Q&amp;A retrieval pipelines that provide the highest accuracy. When compared with alternate models, NeMo Retriever NIM microservices provided 30% fewer inaccurate answers for enterprise question answering.</p>
<figure id="attachment_73138" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73138" style="width: 811px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-73138" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nemo-retriever-embedding-reranking-comparison.png" alt="Bar chart showing lexical search (45%), alternative embedder (63%), compared with NeMo Retriever embedding NIM (73%) and NeMo Retriever embedding + reranking NIM microservices (75%)." width="811" height="321" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nemo-retriever-embedding-reranking-comparison.png 811w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nemo-retriever-embedding-reranking-comparison-400x158.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nemo-retriever-embedding-reranking-comparison-672x266.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nemo-retriever-embedding-reranking-comparison-768x304.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nemo-retriever-embedding-reranking-comparison-406x161.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nemo-retriever-embedding-reranking-comparison-188x74.png 188w" sizes="(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-73138" class="wp-caption-text">Comparison of NeMo Retriever embedding NIM and embedding plus reranking NIM microservices performance versus lexical search and an alternative embedder.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The team — consisting of NVIDIANs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aerdem4/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1721670200192732&amp;usg=AOvVaw097v0q1qfYZH3Wca9bat0d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahmet Erdem</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benedikt-schifferer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benedikt Schifferer</a>, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Deotte</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giba1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gilberto Titericz</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lytic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ivan Sorokin</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-jegou/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simon Jegou</a> — demonstrated its prowess in generative AI, winning in categories that included text generation, multiple-choice questions, name entity recognition, ranking, and retrieval.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-73115" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-672x156.png" alt="" width="672" height="156" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-672x156.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-400x93.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-768x178.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1536x356.png 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-842x195.png 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-406x94.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-188x44.png 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1-1280x296.png 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image1.png 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>The competition, themed “<a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/amazon-kdd-cup-2024-multi-task-online-shopping-challenge-for-llms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multi-Task Online Shopping Challenge for LLMs</a>,” asked participants to solve various challenges using limited datasets.</p>
<p>“The new trend in LLM competitions is that they don’t give you training data,” said Deotte, a senior data scientist at NVIDIA. “They give you 96 example questions — not enough to train a model — so we came up with 500,000 questions on our own.”</p>
<p>Deotte explained that the NVIDIA team generated a variety of questions by writing some themselves, using a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language model</a> to create others, and transforming existing e-commerce datasets.</p>
<p>“Once we had our questions, it was straightforward to use existing frameworks to fine-tune a language model,” he said.</p>
<p>The competition organizers hid the test questions to ensure participants couldn’t exploit previously known answers. This approach encourages models that generalize well to any question about e-commerce, proving the model’s capability to handle real-world scenarios effectively.</p>
<p>Despite these constraints, Team NVIDIA’s innovative approach outperformed all competitors by using Qwen2-72B, a just-released LLM with 72 billion parameters, fine-tuned on eight NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, and employing QLoRA, a technique for fine-tuning models with datasets.</p>
<h2><strong>About the KDD Cup 2024</strong></h2>
<p>The KDD Cup, organized by the Association for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, or ACM SIGKDD, is a prestigious annual competition that promotes research and development in the field.</p>
<p>This year’s challenge, hosted by Amazon, focused on mimicking the complexities of online shopping with the goal of making it a more intuitive and satisfying experience using large language models. Organizers utilized the test dataset ShopBench — a benchmark that replicates the massive challenge for online shopping with 57 tasks and about 20,000 questions derived from real-world Amazon shopping data — to evaluate participants&#8217; models.</p>
<p>The ShopBench benchmark focused on four key shopping skills, along with a fifth “all-in-one” challenge:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shopping Concept Understanding: Decoding complex shopping concepts and terminologies.</li>
<li>Shopping Knowledge Reasoning: Making informed decisions with shopping knowledge.</li>
<li>User Behavior Alignment: Understanding dynamic customer behavior.</li>
<li>Multilingual Abilities: Shopping across languages.</li>
<li>All-Around: Solving all tasks from the previous tracks in a unified solution.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>NVIDIA’s Winning Solution</strong></h2>
<p>NVIDIA’s winning solution involved creating a single model for each track.</p>
<p>The team fine-tuned the just-released Qwen2-72B model using eight NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs for approximately 24 hours. The GPUs provided fast and efficient processing, significantly reducing the time required for fine-tuning.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-73118" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-672x191.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="191" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-672x191.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-400x114.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-768x219.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-1536x438.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-842x240.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-406x116.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-188x54.jpg 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-1280x365.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2.jpg 1811w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>First, the team generated training datasets based on the provided examples and synthesized additional data using Llama 3 70B hosted on <a href="http://build.nvidia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build.nvidia.com</a>.</p>
<p>Next, they employed QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation), a training process using the data created in step one. QLoRA modifies a smaller subset of the model’s weights, allowing efficient training and fine-tuning.</p>
<p>The model was then quantized — making it smaller and able to run on a system with a smaller hard drive and less memory — with AWQ 4-bit and used the vLLM inference library to predict the test datasets on four NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs within the time constraints.</p>
<p>This approach secured the top spot in each individual track and the overall first place in the competition—a clean sweep for NVIDIA for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>The team plans to submit a detailed paper on its solution next month and plans to present its findings at KDD 2024 in Barcelona.</p>
