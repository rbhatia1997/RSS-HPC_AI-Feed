										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>An avid cyclist, Thomas Park knows the value of having lots of gears to maintain a smooth, fast ride.</p>
<p>So, when the software architect designed an AI inference platform to serve predictions for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s (OCI) Vision AI service, he picked <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/triton-inference-server/">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a>. That’s because it can shift up, down or sideways to handle virtually any AI model, framework and hardware and operating mode — quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>“The NVIDIA AI inference platform gives our worldwide cloud services customers tremendous flexibility in how they build and run their AI applications,” said Park, a Zurich-based computer engineer and competitive cycler who’s worked for four of the world’s largest cloud services providers.</p>
<p>Specifically, Triton reduced OCI’s total cost of ownership by 10%, increased prediction throughput up to 76% and reduced inference latency up to 51% for OCI Vision and Document Understanding Service models that were migrated to Triton. The services run globally across more than 45 regional data centers, according to <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/ai-and-datascience/post/oci-ai-vision-nvidia-triton-inference-server">an Oracle blog</a> Park and a colleague posted earlier this year.</p>
<h2><b>Computer Vision Accelerates Insights</b></h2>
<p>Customers rely on OCI Vision AI for a wide variety of object detection and image classification jobs. For instance, a U.S.-based transit agency uses it to automatically detect the number of vehicle axles passing by to calculate and bill bridge tolls, sparing busy truckers wait time at toll booths.</p>
<p>OCI AI is also available in Oracle NetSuite, a set of business applications used by more than 37,000 organizations worldwide. It’s used, for example, to automate invoice recognition.</p>
<p>Thanks to Park’s work, Triton is now being adopted across other OCI services, too.</p>
<h2><b>A Triton-Aware Data Service</b></h2>
<p>“We’ve built a Triton-aware AI platform for our customers,” said Tzvi Keisar, a director of product management for OCI’s Data Science service, which handles machine learning for Oracle’s internal and external users.</p>
<p>“If customers want to use Triton, we’ll save them time by automatically doing the configuration work for them in the background, launching a Triton-powered inference endpoint for them,” said Keisar.</p>
<p>His team also plans to make it even easier for its other users to embrace the fast, flexible inference server. Triton is included in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a>, a platform that provides full security and support businesses need — and it’s available on <a href="https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/listing/155314141">OCI Marketplace</a>.</p>
<h2><b>A Massive SaaS Platform</b></h2>
<p>OCI’s Data Science service is the machine learning platform for both NetSuite and Oracle Fusion software-as-a-service applications.</p>
<p>“These platforms are massive, with tens of thousands of customers who are also building their work on top of our service,” he said.</p>
<p>It’s a wide swath of mainly enterprise users in manufacturing, retail, transportation and other industries. They’re building and using AI models of nearly every shape and size.</p>
<p>Inference was one of the group’s first services, and Triton came on the team’s radar not long after its launch.</p>
<h2><b>A Best-in-Class Inference Framework</b></h2>
<p>“We saw Triton pick up in popularity as a best-in-class serving framework, so we started experimenting with it,” Keisar said. “We saw really good performance, and it closed a gap in our existing offerings, especially on multi-model inference — it’s the most versatile and advanced inferencing framework out there.”</p>
<p>Launched on OCI <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/ai-and-datascience/post/oci-nvidia-triton-inference-server">in March</a>, Triton has already attracted the attention of many internal teams at Oracle hoping to use it for inference jobs that require serving predictions from multiple AI models running concurrently.</p>
<p>“Triton has a very good track record and performance on multiple models deployed on a single endpoint,” he said.</p>
<h2><b>Accelerating the Future</b></h2>
<p>Looking ahead, Keisar’s team is evaluating <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt#inference">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a> software to supercharge inference on the complex large language models (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">LLMs</a>) that have captured the imagination of many users.</p>
<p>An active blogger, Keisar’s <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/ai-and-datascience/post/quantize-deploy-llama2-70b-costeffective-a10s-oci">latest article</a> detailed creative quantization techniques for running a Llama 2 LLM with a whopping 70 billion parameters on NVIDIA A10 Tensor Core GPUs.</p>
<p>“Even down to four bits, the quality of model outputs is still quite good,” he said. “I can’t explain all the math, but we found a good balance, and I haven’t seen anyone else do this yet.”</p>
<p>After announcements this fall that Oracle is deploying the latest <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, H200 GPUs, L40S GPUs and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/">Grace Hopper Superchips</a>, it’s just the start of many accelerated efforts to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of our weekly </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/in-the-nvidia-studio/"><i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/"><i>NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> technology improves creative workflows. We’re also deep diving on new </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/"><i>GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU</i></a><i> features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.</i></p>
<p>A new year means new creative opportunities and new <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i> beats.</p>
<p>Each week, featured <i>In the NVIDIA Studio </i>artists share their unique artwork and content creation processes, as well as how <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/">NVIDIA Studio</a> — a platform comprising <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/laptops-desktops/">fine-tuned hardware</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/software/">efficient software</a> powered by NVIDIA and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/laptops/?nvid=nv-int-bnr-419233#cid=_nv-int-bnr_en-us">GeForce RTX GPUs</a> — elevates their work.</p>
<p>This week’s featured 3D content creator, Pedro Soares, aka Blendeered, created a stunning NVIDIA-themed New Year’s celebration animation.</p>
<p>Plus, tune in to the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/ces/">NVIDIA Special Address at CES</a> on Monday, Jan. 8, at 8 a.m. PT for the latest on content creation, AI-related news and more.</p>
<h2><b>Blendeered’s Beguiling Renders </b></h2>
<p>Blendeered’s latest animation was inspired by NVIDIA and the power of technological innovation.</p>
<p>“The scene, <i>New Year’s,</i> showcases a futuristic city with all the buildings funneling to the center point,” said Blendeered. “This evokes the feeling of accelerating toward a brighter future, which is what NVIDIA is all about: taking tech to the next level, every day.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy New Year from NVIDIA Studio! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f386.png" alt="🎆" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f387.png" alt="🎇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>&mdash; NVIDIA Studio (@NVIDIAStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAStudio/status/1741866957631070681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Portugal-based creator first conceptualized the scene.</p>
<p>“The futuristic city needed to give a sense of speed,” he said. He accomplished this using highlighted arrows, neon-green street lines and light beams on digital screens across various high-rise buildings.</p>
<p>Blendeered then built individual assets in Blender version 3.6 — by far his favorite 3D app, in case his stage name didn’t give it away.</p>
<p>“Blender captivates users with its friendly interface, speed, power, real-time rendering and vibrant community — and the best part is that it’s free!” he shared.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU</a> unlocked Blender Cycles’ <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ray-tracing/optix">RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing</a> in the viewport for interactive, photorealistic modeling sequences. He also textured and applied color schemes to his 3D assets in Blender.</p>
<p>Next, the artist began lighting the scene using the new Panorama feature in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/canvas/">NVIDIA Canvas</a> app. He tapped OptiX denoising to preview final render results in real time, speeding his workflow.</p>
<p>Available for GeForce RTX GPU owners and free to download, NVIDIA Canvas uses AI to turn brushstrokes into realistic landscape images for quick creation of backgrounds and concept exploration.</p>

<p>Blendeered generated a full, spherical, high-dynamic-range imaging (HDRi) backdrop for his computer-generated imagery workflows — based on AI rendering — with a few simple sketches. He then exported it as an HDR file and imported it into Blender. YouTuber Timo Helmers demonstrates this type of workflow in the video tutorial below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Get unique HDRI backdrops for your CG renders.

<p>“NVIDIA Canvas is amazing software that allowed me to make an HDRi backdrop that fit my scene perfectly,” said Blendeered.</p>
<p>From there, he completed the animation process before exporting the files to Blackmagic Design’s DaVinci Resolve version 18.</p>

<p>DaVinci Resolve is a key app for GPU acceleration and AI-powered workflows. All of the AI effects in DaVinci Resolve version 18.6 run twice as fast on NVIDIA RTX GPUs with acceleration using the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt-getting-started">NVIDIA TensorRT</a> software development kit.</p>
<p>Blendeered’s post-production work included GPU-accelerated color grading, video editing and color scopes. And <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-codec-sdk">NVENC</a>, a GPU hardware accelerator engine for video decoding, enabled faster, smoother playback and scrubbing of high-resolution video files.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69007" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69007" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-itns-pedro-soares-wk90-davinci-pp-1280w.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69007" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-itns-pedro-soares-wk90-davinci-pp-1280w-672x359.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="359" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-itns-pedro-soares-wk90-davinci-pp-1280w-672x359.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-itns-pedro-soares-wk90-davinci-pp-1280w-400x213.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-itns-pedro-soares-wk90-davinci-pp-1280w-768x410.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-itns-pedro-soares-wk90-davinci-pp-1280w-842x450.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-itns-pedro-soares-wk90-davinci-pp-1280w-403x215.jpg 403w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-itns-pedro-soares-wk90-davinci-pp-1280w-188x100.jpg 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-itns-pedro-soares-wk90-davinci-pp-1280w.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69007" class="wp-caption-text">Post-production work in DaVinci Resolve.</figcaption></figure>
<p>For the final export, the eighth generation NVENC worked together with the built-in dual encoders on the artist’s GeForce RTX 4090 GPU to generate video files twice as fast. For Blendeered, NVIDIA GPUs are the clear choice for content creation because they provide “power, efficiency and reliability.”</p>
<p>When asked to give advice for aspiring artists, Blendeered encouraged beginners to “embrace consistent practice, learn from failures, seek feedback and stay true to the inner artistic voice.”</p>

<p>These initiatives — accelerated using NVIDIA GPUs, deep learning software and robotics technology — are alerting conservationists to poaching threats, powering more sustainable aquaculture and helping scientists monitor coral reef health.</p>
<p>Take a safari through the NVIDIA Blog’s top animal stories of 2023 below.</p>
<p>As a bonus, discover how animals — whether beautiful butterflies, flashy fish or massive mammoths — are inspiring a herd of digital artists.</p>
<h2><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/conservation-ai-detects-threats-to-endangered-species/"><b>Protecting Pangolins From Poachers</b></a></h2>
<p>Conservation AI, a U.K.-based nonprofit, is preserving biodiversity with an edge AI platform that analyzes camera footage in real time to identify species of interest, rapidly alerting conservationists to threats such as wildfires or poachers.</p>
<p>Founded by researchers at Liverpool John Moores University, the nonprofit now has dozens of cameras deployed across the globe running an AI platform built using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a> modules, the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk">NVIDIA DeepStream</a> software development kit and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a>.</p>
<p>The AI software is being deployed in Uganda and South Africa to keep an eye on pangolins and rhinos at risk of being hunted by poachers.</p>

<h2><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/colossal-biosciences-de-extinct-woolly-mammoth-parabricks/"><b>Bringing Colossal Insights to a Woolly Problem</b></a></h2>
<p>Colossal Biosciences is tackling endangered species conservation and de-extinction using computational biology.</p>
<p>Using gene editing technology, AI models and the <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/clara/parabricks/latest/index.html">NVIDIA Parabricks software suite</a> for genomic analysis, scientists at Colossal are working to bring back the woolly mammoth, the dodo bird and the Tasmanian tiger — and protect dwindling species such as the African forest elephant.</p>
<p>After combining incomplete DNA sequences from extinct species’ bone samples with genomic data from closely related creatures, the team uses Parabricks for sequence alignment and variant calling — enabling them to complete analysis 12x faster.</p>
<h2><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gosmart-fish-farming-ai/"><b>Enabling Efficient Fish Farming</b></a></h2>
<p>GoSmart, a member of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a> program for cutting-edge startups and the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/intelligent-video-analytics-platform/">NVIDIA Metropolis</a> vision AI partner ecosystem, is deploying AI for more efficient and sustainable fish farming.</p>
<p>The company’s compact edge AI system, powered by the NVIDIA Jetson platform, analyzes a pond or tank’s temperature and oxygen levels, as well as the average weight and population distribution of fish — information farmers can use for decisions around fish feeding and harvesting.</p>
<p>The team is also adding AI models that analyze fish behavior and indicators of disease and plans to integrate its solution with autonomous feeding systems.</p>
<h2><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-for-coral-reef-conservation/"><b>AI Can See Your (Coral Reef) Halo</b></a></h2>
<p>Researchers at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa are analyzing satellite imagery using NVIDIA GPU-powered AI to track halos — the rings of sand that surround coral reefs — as a way to assess ecosystem health.</p>
<p>The presence of halos indicates that a coral reef has a healthy population of marine life, including fish and invertebrates. A change in their shape suggests a degrading environment that needs attention from conservationists.</p>
<p>The researchers’ AI tool, which runs on an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a6000/">NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU</a>, can analyze hundreds of coral reef halos in around two minutes, a task that would take 10 hours for a human to complete.</p>

<h2><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/coral-reef-decline-curee-robot-jetson-isaac-omniverse/"><b>Reef-Roving Robot Tracks Undersea Life</b></a></h2>
<p>An autonomous underwater robot powered by the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX</a> module is roaming reef ecosystems to help scientists understand human impact on reefs and surrounding sea creatures.</p>
<p>Developed by researchers at MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution’s Autonomous Robotics and Perception Laboratory, the CUREE robot collects environmental data that informs 3D models of reefs.</p>
<p>The team developed an AI model called DeepSeeColor that cleans up blurry underwater footage to enable more accurate fish detection by another neural network. They’re also working on detection models to identify audio samples from different creatures.</p>
<h2><b>Fantastic Fauna: Animals Inspire AI-Powered Digital Art</b></h2>
<p>Greek philosopher Plato said that art imitates life — and digital art is no exception, as exemplified by artists who this year used NVIDIA technology to develop stunning animal-inspired visuals.</p>
<p>Honoring marine life, BBC Studios’ Alessandro Mastronardi created a series of incredibly <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/alessandro-mastronardi-blender-omniverse-broadcast/">realistic shark videos and renders</a> in Blender and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/creators/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform for connecting and building custom 3D tools and applications with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Before ringing in the new year, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/">GeForce NOW</a> is taking a look back at a 2023 full of top-notch gaming. Explore GeForce NOW’s year in review, which brought more hit games, improved service features and the launch of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/memberships/">Ultimate membership</a> tier.</p>
<p>Plus, GFN Thursday is raising a toast to the GeForce NOW community by delivering more than 40 new games to stream from the cloud.</p>
<h2><b>Wrapping It Up</b></h2>
<p>It’s been an amazing year of cloud gaming. The launch of the Ultimate tier brought high-performance cloud gaming across North America and Europe, streaming from newly rolled out <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-jan-19/">GeForce RTX 4080 SuperPODs</a>.</p>
<p>For the first time in the cloud, members could stream up to 240 frames per second, or 4K 120 fps on the native PC and Mac apps, and experience support for ultrawide resolutions for the smoothest and most immersive gameplay — all thanks to the powerful <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/ada-lovelace-architecture/">NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPU architecture</a>.</p>
<p>To prove the power of the cloud, NVIDIA gave gamers the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-aug-17/">ultimate test</a> of latency on <i>KovaaK’s</i>, a latency-sensitive, first-person-shooter aim trainer.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-68965" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-672x372.jpeg" alt="GeForce NOW Kovaak's Ultimate Challenge Leaderboard" width="672" height="372" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-672x372.jpeg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-400x221.jpeg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-768x425.jpeg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-814x450.jpeg 814w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-389x215.jpeg 389w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-181x100.jpeg 181w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard-1280x708.jpeg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leaderboard.jpeg 1441w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>Gamers competed for top scores on the leaderboard, and the results were staggering — showing a 1.8x improvement in aiming just by playing with an Ultimate membership.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GeForce NOW: Power The Cloud With Chromebook Plus" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yf-zZWkyfLM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA also posed a challenge to <i>Cyberpunk 2077 </i>fans: to play the graphics-intensive game on an unknown system. Players were astonished to discover that they were playing with full ray tracing on a Chromebook with GeForce NOW. NVIDIA even brought the experience to The Game Awards, showing off the power of gaming on a Chromebook with GeForce NOW on a global stage.</p>
<p>With higher-performance streaming came more collaborations with top-quality publishers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>With all the talk of how generative AI is going to change the world, it’s worth looking back on how AI’s already enabled leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>NVIDIA helped automate airport operations, vehicle manufacturing, industrial inspections and more with AI to create smarter spaces in 2023.</p>
<h2><b>Airport AI Takes Off</b></h2>
<p>Toronto Pearson International Airport <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/zensors-visual-ai/">in June deployed</a> the Zensors AI platform, which uses security cameras to generate spatial data to help optimize operations. <a href="https://www.zensors.com/">Zensors</a> is a member of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/intelligent-video-analytics-platform/">NVIDIA Metropolis</a>, a partner program for improving operations with visual data and AI, and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a>, a free program that nurtures cutting-edge startups.</p>
<p>The Zensors platform uses anonymized data to count travelers in lines, identify congested areas and predict passenger wait times — and it can send alerts to help speed operations. Other startups <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/airplane-turnarounds-gpu-ai-assaia/">have landed in this space</a> to reduce flight delays.</p>
<p>“Zensors is making visual AI easy for all to use,” said Anuraag Jain, the company’s cofounder and head of product and technology.</p>
<h2><b>Inspect Your Gadget</b></h2>
<p>Taiwanese manufacturers like Foxconn Industrial Internet, Pegatron, Quanta and Wistron <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/electronics-giants-industrial-automation-nvidia-metropolis-for-factories/">are embracing</a> NVIDIA Metropolis for Factories to enable automated optical inspections.</p>
<p>Pegatron makes motherboards, smartphones, laptops, game consoles and much more. <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/metropolis-for-factories">It uses Metropolis for Factories</a> to support its printed circuit board factories, achieving 99.8% accuracy on its automated optical inspection systems.</p>
<p>How’s that for a smarter workspace.</p>
<h2><b>PepsiCo’s AI Pop</b></h2>
<p>Beverage giant PepsiCo has deployed vision AI from KoiReader Technologies, an NVIDIA Metropolis partner, for efficiency gains in reading warehouse labels.</p>
<p>The startup’s technology <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/pepsi-koivision/">is being tapped</a> to train and run the deep learning models behind PepsiCo’s AI label and barcode scanning system.</p>
<p>“If you find the right lever, you could dramatically improve our throughput,” said Greg Bellon, senior director of digital supply chain at PepsiCo.</p>
<h2><b>Driving Digital Production</b></h2>
<p>With NVIDIA Omniverse — a collaborative platform for developing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description</a> applications to design, plan and operate manufacturing and assembly facilities — Mercedes-Benz is using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-twin">digital twins</a> for production.</p>
<p>Harnessing Omniverse, Mercedes-Benz can interact directly with its suppliers, reducing coordination processes by 50%.</p>
<p>“Using NVIDIA Omniverse and AI, Mercedes-Benz is building a connected, digital-first approach to optimize its manufacturing processes, ultimately reducing construction time and production costs,” said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA.</p>
<h2><b>Juicing AI for Batteries</b></h2>
<p>Smart spaces often begin in the virtual world.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/siemens-nvidia-freyr/">Siemens showcased</a> an immersive digital model for a look into future FREYR Battery factories, powered by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">Omniverse</a>.</p>
<p>The industrial giant demoed a blueprint for how teams can harness comprehensive digital twins virtually using models of existing and future plants. The technologies aim to help FREYR meet surging demand for high-density, cost-effective battery cells.</p>
<p>That’s AI to get charged up about.</p>

<h2><b>Deck the Halls With Tons of Renders</b></h2>
<p>“The goal was to create something that invoked warmth, joy and holiday spirit,” said Johnson on ideating for this year’s NVIDIA holiday card. “There’s nothing better than being with family, cuddled up on the couch, enjoying each other’s time while wearing something really cozy and relaxing.”</p>
<p>The NVIDIA artists created foreground characters starting with basic elements from the trio’s collective asset library.</p>
<p>Baldasseroni took the lead on modeling and tweaking the characters in ZBrush, working closely with Johnson on the right composition, and even provided preliminary posing to help guide the character feel for a relaxed family portrait.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68901-3" width="1280" height="720" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-christmas-wk89-zbrush-1280w.mp4?_=3" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-christmas-wk89-zbrush-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-christmas-wk89-zbrush-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving to Adobe Substance 3D Painter, Baldasseroni created and applied custom textures to the models. His <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a6000/">NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU</a> accelerated <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/direct-indirect-lighting/">light and ambient occlusion</a>, baking optimized assets in mere seconds.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>“I used GPU acceleration in Adobe Substance Painter and worked with preliminary lookdev renders in the NVIDIA Iray engine.” — Alessandro Baldasseroni</p>
</div>
<p>Sugianto took on animation work, opening Autodesk Maya where her NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU provided several key advantages.</p>
<p>RTX-accelerated ray tracing and AI-powered denoising with the Autodesk Arnold renderer resulted in highly interactive and photorealistic modeling.</p>
<p>Autodesk Maya also supports third-party GPU-accelerated renderers, such as V-Ray, OctaneRender and Redshift, which gave Sugianto more options to animate the scene.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68901-4" width="1280" height="696" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-christmas-wk89-maya-1280w.mp4?_=4" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-christmas-wk89-maya-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-christmas-wk89-maya-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the assets beautifully modeled, textured and animated, Johnson imported all files into the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/usd-composer/">NVIDIA Omniverse USD Composer</a> app to add physically accurate properties for the realistic fire, candle lighting and smoke.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA RTX GPU rendering in USD Composer is so fast at enabling quick iterations and different looks,” said Johnson.</p>
<p>Johnson used OpenUSD files in USD Composer, allowing Baldasseroni and Sugianto to review Johnson’s edits in real time with fully ray-traced details. This eliminated the need to download, upload and reformat files to share and consolidate feedback from other stakeholders, saving valuable time and resources.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68901-5" width="1280" height="532" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-christmas-wk89-composer2-1280w.mp4?_=5" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-christmas-wk89-composer2-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-christmas-wk89-composer2-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson then rendered out still images into Adobe Photoshop for final color grading. He further improved visual quality by upscaling the image using the AI-powered, RTX-accelerated <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-video-super-resolution/">Super Resolution</a> feature — which is significantly faster than traditional methods. Throughout his workflow, Johnson could choose from more than 30 GPU-accelerated features, including blur gallery, object selection, liquify, smart sharpen and perspective.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-68901-6" width="1280" height="532" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-christmas-wk89-photoshop-1280w.mp4?_=6" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-christmas-wk89-photoshop-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-christmas-wk89-photoshop-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He then uploaded files into Nuke, a visual-effects and video-editing software, for final GPU-accelerated compositing of all the scene’s elements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>AI made a splash this year — from Wall Street to the U.S. Congress — driven by a wave of developers aiming to make the world better.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at AI in 2023 across agriculture, natural disasters, medicine and other areas worthy of a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/music-youtube-cocktail-party-problem-ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-learning/">cocktail party</a> conversation.</p>
<h2><b>This AI Is on Fire</b></h2>
<p>California has recently seen record wildfires. With scorching heat late into the summer, the state’s crispy foliage becomes a tinderbox that can ignite and quickly blaze out of control. Burning for solutions, developers are embracing AI for early detection.</p>
<p>DigitalPath, based in Chico, California, has refined a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-cnn-and-an-rnn/">convolutional neural network</a> to spot wildfires. The model, run on NVIDIA GPUs, enables thousands of cameras across the state to detect wildfires in real time for the ALERTCalifornia initiative, a collaboration between the University of California, San Diego, and the CAL FIRE wildfire agency.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-wildfires-california/">The mission</a> is near and dear to DigitalPath employees, whose office sits not far from the town of Paradise, where California’s deadliest wildfire killed 85 people in 2018.</p>
<p>“It’s one of the main reasons we’re doing this,” said CEO Jim Higgins. “We don’t want people to lose their lives.”</p>
<h2><b>Earth-Shaking Research</b></h2>
<p>A team from the University of California, Santa Cruz; University of California, Berkeley; and the Technical University of Munich <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL103909">released a paper</a> this year on a new deep learning model for earthquake forecasts.</p>
<p>Shaking up the status quo around the ETAS model standard, developed in 1988, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/quakes-deep-learning-forecasts/">the new RECAST model</a>, trained on NVIDIA GPUs, is capable of using larger datasets and holds promise for making better predictions during earthquake sequences.</p>
<p>“There’s a ton of room for improvement within the forecasting side of things,” said Kelian Dascher-Cousineau, one of the paper’s authors.</p>
<h2><b>AI’s Day in the Sun</b></h2>
<p>Verdant, based in the San Francisco Bay Area, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/verdant-farm-organics-jetson-orin/">is supporting organic farming</a>. The startup develops AI for <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/mondavi-monarch-smart-electric-jetson-tractor/">tractor</a> implements that can weed, fertilize and spray, providing labor support while lowering production costs for farmers and boosting yields.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson Orin</a>-based robots-as-a-service business provides farmers with metrics on yield gains and chemical reduction. “We wanted to do something meaningful to help the environment,” said Lawrence Ibarria, chief operating officer at Verdant.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sniper robot treats 500k plants per hour with 95% less chemicals | Challengers" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sV0cR_Nhac0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Living the Dream </b></h2>
<p>Ge Dong is living out her childhood dream, following in her mother’s footsteps by pursuing physics. She cofounded <a href="https://www.energysingularity.cn/en/">Energy Singularity</a>, a startup that aims to lower the cost of building a commercial tokamak — which can cost billions of dollars —for fusion energy development.</p>
<p>It brings the promise of cleaner energy.</p>
<p>“We’ve been using NVIDIA GPUs for all our research — they’re one of the most important tools in plasma physics these days,” <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-hpc-energy-fusion/">she said</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Gimme Shelter</b></h2>
<p>Chaofeng Wang, a University of Florida assistant professor of artificial intelligence, is enlisting deep learning and images from Google Street View to evaluate urban buildings. By automating the process, the work is intended to assist governments in supporting building structures and post-disaster recovery.</p>
<p>“Without NVIDIA GPUs, we wouldn’t have been able to do this,” <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/street-view-image-deep-learning-research-urban-building/">Wang said</a>. “They significantly accelerate the process, ensuring timely results.”</p>
<h2><b>AI Predicts Covid Variants</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/genomic-large-language-model-predicts-covid-variants/">A Gordon Bell prize-winning model</a>, GenSLMs has shown it can generate gene sequences closely resembling real-world variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19. Researchers trained the model using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU</a>-powered supercomputers, including NVIDIA’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/making-selene-pandemic-ai/">Selene</a>, the U.S. Department of Energy’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nersc-perlmutter-ai-supercomputer/">Perlmutter</a> and Argonne’s <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-turbocharges-extreme-scale-ai-for-argonne-national-laboratorys-polaris-supercomputer">Polaris</a> system.</p>
<p>“The AI’s ability to predict the kinds of gene mutations present in recent COVID strains — despite having only seen the Alpha and Beta variants during training — is a strong validation of its capabilities,” said Arvind Ramanathan, lead researcher on the project and a computational biologist at Argonne.</p>
<h2><b>Jetson-Enabled Autonomous Wheelchair</b></h2>
<p>Kabilan KB, an undergraduate student from the Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences in Coimbatore, India, is developing an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a>-enabled autonomous wheelchair. To help boost development, he’s been using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform for building and operating 3D tools and applications based on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">OpenUSD</a> framework.</p>
<p>“Using Omniverse for simulation, I don’t need to invest heavily in prototyping models for my robots, because I can use <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/">synthetic data</a> generation instead,” <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/kabilan-kb-autonomous-wheelchair/">he said</a>. “It’s the software of the future.”</p>
<h2><b>Digital Twins for Brain Surgery</b></h2>
<p>Atlas Meditech is using the <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/monai/index.html">MONAI</a> medical imaging framework and the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> 3D development platform to help build AI-powered decision support and high-fidelity surgery rehearsal platforms — all in an effort to improve surgical outcomes and patient safety.</p>
<p>“With accelerated computing and digital twins, we want to transform this mental rehearsal into a highly realistic rehearsal in simulation,” <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/atlas-meditech-brain-surgery-ai-digital-twins/">said Dr. Aaron Cohen-Gadol</a>, founder of the company.</p>
<h2><b>Keeping AI on Energy </b></h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence is helping optimize solar and wind farms, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/climate-research-next-wave/">simulate climate and weather</a>, and support power grid reliability and other areas of the energy market.</p>
<p>Check out this installment of the <a href="https://youtu.be/zrcxLZmOyNA?feature=shared">I AM AI video series</a> to learn about how NVIDIA is enabling these technologies and working with energy-conscious collaborators to drive breakthroughs for a cleaner, safer, more <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/l/en-us-sustainable-computing">sustainable future</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Powering the Future of Clean Energy | I AM AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrcxLZmOyNA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>AI Can See Clearly Now</b></h2>
<p>Many patients in lower- and middle-income countries lack access to cataract surgery because of a shortage of ophthalmologists. But more than 2,000 doctors a year in lower-income countries can now treat cataract blindness — the world’s <a href="https://academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/14/Supplement_1/i68/6563812">leading cause of blindness</a> —using GPU-powered surgical simulation with the help of nonprofit HelpMeSee.</p>
<p>“We’re lowering the barrier for healthcare practitioners to learn these specific skills that can have a profound impact on patients,” <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/helpmesee-nonprofit-training-simulator-for-cataract-surgery/">said Bonnie An Henderson</a>, CEO of the New York-based nonprofit.</p>
<h2><b>Waste Not, Want Not</b></h2>
<p>Afresh, based in San Francisco, helps stores reduce food waste. The startup has developed machine learning and AI models using data on fresh produce to help grocers make informed inventory-purchasing decisions. It has also launched software that enables grocers to save time and increase data accuracy with inventory tracking.</p>
<p>“The most impactful thing we can do is reduce food waste to mitigate climate change,” said Nathan Fenner, cofounder and president of Afresh, on the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/ai-podcast/">NVIDIA AI podcast</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Outside the glare of the klieg lights that ChatGPT commanded this year, a troupe of autonomous machines nudged the frontiers of robotics forward.</p>
<p>Here are six that showed special prowess — swimming, diving, gripping, seeing, strolling and flying through 2023.</p>
<h2><b>A Media Darling at CES</b></h2>
<p>Ella — a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ella-stroller-jetson/">smart stroller</a> from startup <a href="https://gluxkind.com/">Glüxkind Technologies</a>, of Vancouver, Canada — kicked off the year when it was named an honoree in the <a href="https://www.ces.tech/innovation-awards/honorees.aspx">CES 2023 Innovation Awards</a>.</p>
<p>The canny carriage uses computer vision running on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform</a> to follow parents. Its AI-powered abilities, like smart braking and a rock-my-baby mode, captured the attention of media outlets like <i>Good Morning America</i> and <i>The Times of London</i> as well as an <a href="https://soundcloud.com/theaipodcast/ai-stroller">NVIDIA AI Podcast interview</a> with its husband-and-wife cofounders.</p>
<p>A member of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a>, a free program for cutting-edge startups, Gl<a href="https://gluxkind.com/">ü</a>xkind was one of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/jetson-innovation-awards-ces/">seven companies</a> with NVIDIA-powered products recognized at the Las Vegas event in January. They included:</p>
<ul>
<li>John Deere for its fully autonomous tractor,</li>
<li>AGRIST for its robot that automatically harvests bell peppers,</li>
<li>Inception member Skydio for its drone that can fly at a set distance and height without manual intervention,</li>
<li>Neubility, another Inception member, for its self-driving delivery robot,</li>
<li>Seoul Robotics, a partner in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/intelligent-video-analytics-platform/">NVIDIA Metropolis</a> vision AI software, for its <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/seoul-robotics-autonomy-through-infrastructure/">Level 5 Control Tower</a> that can turn standard vehicles into self-driving cars, and</li>
<li>WHILL for its one-person vehicle that automatically guides a user inside places like airports or hospitals.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Dexterous Food Packer</b></h2>
<p>Inception startup Soft Robotics, of Bedford, Mass., introduced its mGripAI system to an $8 trillion food industry hungry for automation. It combines 3D vision and AI to grasp delicate items such as chicken wings, attracting investors that include Tyson Foods and Johnsonville.</p>
<p>Soft Robotics uses the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platform and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim">NVIDIA Isaac Sim</a> robotics simulator to create 3D renderings of chicken parts on conveyor belts or in bins. With help from AI and the ray-tracing capabilities of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/ampere-architecture/">NVIDIA RTX</a> technology, they help the robot gripper handle as many as 100 picks per minute, even under glare or changing light conditions.</p>
<p>“We’re all in on Omniverse and Isaac Sim, and that’s been working great for us,” David Weatherwax, senior director of software engineering at Soft Robotics, said in a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/isaac-soft-robotics-simulation/">January interview</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="mGripAI Poultry Automation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YhfdyOa-XPQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>A Keen Eye in the Factory</b></h2>
<p>In a very different example of industrial digitalization, leading electronics manufacturer Quanta is inspecting the quality of its products using<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/techman-robot-isaac-sim/"> the TM25S</a>, an AI-enabled robot from its subsidiary, Techman Robot.</p>
<p>Using Omniverse, Techman built a<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/"> digital twin</a> of the inspection robot — as well as the product to be inspected — in Isaac Sim. Programming the robot in simulation reduced time spent on the task by over 70%, compared to programming manually on the real robot.</p>
<p>Then, with powerful optimization tools in Isaac Sim, Techman explored a massive number of program options in parallel on NVIDIA GPUs. The end result, shown in the video below, was an efficient solution that reduced the cycle time of each inspection by 20%.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Techman AI Robot for Quality Inspection | Developed in Isaac Sim and powered by Omniverse" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b2yjubjQ5Xs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Sailing the Seas for Data Science</b></h2>
<p>For its part, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/saildrone-autonomous-oceanic-monitoring-jetson-deepstream/">Saildrone</a>, an Inception startup in Alameda, Calif., created uncrewed watercraft that can cost-effectively gather data for science, fisheries, weather forecasting and more. NVIDIA Jetson modules process data streams from their sensors, some with help from NVIDIA Metropolis vision AI software such as <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk">NVIDIA DeepStream</a>, a development kit for intelligent video analytics.</p>
<p>The video below shows how three of its smart sailboats are helping evaluate ocean health around the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="2023 UH Mānoa Ocean Chemistry Mission" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ev2mLKXkfwY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Destination: Mars</b></h2>
<p>The next stop for one autonomous vehicle may be the red planet.</p>
<p>Caltech’s Multi-Modal Mobility Morphobot, or <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/caltech-nasa-mars-rover-robot-jetson/">M4</a>, can configure itself to walk, fly or drive at speeds up to 40 mph (video below). An M42 version is now under development at NASA as a Mars rover candidate and has attracted interest for other uses like reconnaissance in fire zones.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39018-y">releasing a paper</a> on it in <i>Nature Communications</i>, the team has been inundated with proposals for the shape-shifting drone built on the NVIDIA Jetson platform.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="M4 Drives and Flies Around Caltech&#039;s Campus" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J91jTI2-k_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Delivery Drone Flies High</b></h2>
<p>The year ended on a high note with San Francisco-based <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/zipline-drone-jetson-inception/">Zipline announcing</a> its delivery drones flew more than 65 million miles and made more than 850,000 deliveries since the company’s start in 2011. Zipline now completes one delivery every 70 seconds, globally.</p>
<p>That’s a major milestone for the Inception startup, the field it’s helping pioneer and the customers who can receive everything from pizza to vitamins 7x faster than by truck.</p>
<p>Zipline’s latest drone uses two Jetson Orin NX modules. It can carry eight pounds of cargo for 10 miles at up to 70 mph to deliver packages in single-digit minutes while reducing carbon emissions 97% compared to gasoline-based delivery vehicles.</p>
<h2><b>Machines That Inspire, Amuse</b></h2>
<p>Individual makers designed two autonomous vehicles this year worth special mentions.</p>

<p>Kabilan KB, a robotics developer and student in Coimbatore, India, built an <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/kabilan-kb-autonomous-wheelchair/">autonomous wheelchair</a> using Jetson to run computer vision models that find and navigate a path to a user’s desired destination. The undergrad at the Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences aspires to one day launch a robotics startup.</p>
<p>Finally, an engineering manager in Copenhagen who’s a self-described <i>Star Wars</i> fanatic designed <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/goran-vuksic-pit-droid/">an AI-powered droid</a> based on an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit</a>. Goran Vuksic shared his step-by-step <a href="https://www.hackster.io/gvuksic/nvidia-jetson-orin-nano-powered-pit-droid-7da0e8">technical guide</a>, so others can build their own sci-fi companions.</p>
<p>More than 6,500 companies and 1.2 million developers — as well as a <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/jetson-projects">community</a> of makers and enthusiasts — use the NVIDIA Jetson and Isaac platforms for edge AI and robotics.</p>
<p>To get a look at where autonomous machines will go next, see what’s coming at <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-innovations-ces-2024/">CES in 2024</a>.</p>

<p>It has aN AI-driven digital solution that enables law practitioners to search laws and cases intelligently within different jurisdictions. It also provides AI-powered tools that are set to be integrated with commonly used products like Microsoft 365 to automate the time-consuming processes of drafting and analyzing legal documents.</p>
<p>These technologies increase the productivity of legal professionals, enabling them to focus their time on higher-value work. According to Wong, ultimately these tools also have the potential to help deliver better access to justice.</p>
<p>To address ethical concerns, the company has created publicly available AI development guidelines, as well as privacy and data protection policies. And it’s participating in the drafting of ethical guidelines for the industries it serves.</p>
<p>There’s still a wide range of reactions surrounding AI use in the legal field, from optimism about its potential to fears of job replacement. But Wong underscored that no matter what the outlook, “it is very likely that professionals that use AI are going to replace professionals that don’t use AI.”</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Thomson Reuters aims to further integrate generative AI, as well as <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/__;!!GFN0sa3rsbfR8OLyAw!eiPNsa31SMQnW-_BuvF_hdx903fjMClGjwTUCUagcdiP8HYXBX9OWWyo4pDmh69GwOf2q9ILffhqxiN-ue1JpPAuGs6aImQ$">retrieval-augmented generation</a> techniques into its flagship research products to help lawyers synthesize, read and respond to complicated technical and legal questions. Recently, Thomson Reuters acquired Casetext, which developed the first AI legal assistant, CoCounsel.</p>
<p>In 2024 Thomson Reuters is building on this with the launch of an AI assistant that will be the interface across Thomson Reuters products with GenAI capabilities, including those in other fields such as tax and accounting.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The latest OpenUSD updates enable users to tackle larger, more complex scenes with enhanced geometry control and streamlined asset management.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/news/"><i>Into the Omniverse</i></a><i>, a series focused on how artists, developers and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advances in </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>OpenUSD</i></a><i> and </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>NVIDIA Omniverse</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<p>3D designers and creators are embracing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">Universal Scene Description</a>, aka OpenUSD, to transform their workflows.</p>
<p>Creative software company Foundry’s latest release of <a href="https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke-family/nuke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nuke</a>, a powerful compositing tool for visual effects (VFX), is bringing increased support for OpenUSD, a framework that provides a unified and extensible ecosystem for describing, composing, simulating and collaborating within 3D worlds.</p>
<p>With advanced compositing and improved interoperability capabilities, artists are showcasing the immense potential of Nuke and OpenUSD for visual storytelling.</p>
<h2><b>Bringing 3D Visions to Life With Nuke and OpenUSD</b></h2>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWB2cxFgUbCg79XiGKr41GA">Jacob Zirkle</a> is one such 3D artist.</p>
<p>Inspired by his 10th watch through the <i>Star Wars</i> films, Zirkle wanted to create a sci-fi ship of his own. He first combined computer graphics elements in Blender and Unreal Engine before using USD to bring the scene into Nuke for compositing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-68786 aligncenter" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-11-125415.png" alt="" width="597" height="323" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-11-125415.png 1645w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-11-125415-400x216.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-11-125415-672x363.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-11-125415-768x415.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-11-125415-1536x830.png 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-11-125415-833x450.png 833w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-11-125415-398x215.png 398w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-11-125415-185x100.png 185w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-11-125415-1280x692.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /><i>Zirkle’s ship, built using Blender, Nuke, Unreal Engine and USD Composer.</i></p>
<p>OpenUSD was the glue that held his workflow together.</p>
<p>“Usually, I have to deal with multiple, varying file types in my VFX pipeline, and as soon as something gets updated, it can be a real pain to apply the change across the board,” Zirkle said. “But because I was using the same OpenUSD file for all of my programs, I could save the file once, and changes get automatically propagated through the pipeline — saving me a ton of time.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-68789 aligncenter" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-41.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/edward-mcevenue-omniverse-creator/">Edward McEvenue</a>, an associate creative director at NVIDIA, is using OpenUSD and Nuke to create his short film with the working title: “Dare to Dream.”</p>
<p>Through the project, McEvenue hopes to visualize aspects of automated manufacturing. He uses Autodesk 3ds Max and SideFX Houdini for 3D scene creation, Chaos V-Ray for rendering arbitrary output variables and extended dynamic range sequences, and Nuke for compositing elements for final renders.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-68792 aligncenter" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-40.gif" alt="" width="600" height="253" /></p>
<p>OpenUSD helps streamline data transfer between applications, speeding the iteration process. “Nuke’s USD capabilities allow me to seamlessly transition 3D assets between digital content-creation apps, providing a powerful tool for achieving advanced compositing techniques,” he said.</p>
<p>Other NVIDIA creatives have integrated OpenUSD and Nuke into their 3D workflows. A team of 10 artists developed a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/on-demand/session/siggraph2023-sigg23-16/#:~:text=Harnessing%20OpenUSD%3A%20Iteratively%20Building%20a%20Pipeline%20in%20Production,-Will%20Cavanaugh%20%2C%20Sr&amp;text=NVIDIA%27s%20creative%20group%20shows%20how,for%20our%20own%20future%20development.">fully OpenUSD-based pipeline</a> and custom tooling on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> — a development platform for building OpenUSD-based tools and applications — to bring to life the “<a href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/usd/latest/usd_content_samples/davinci_workshop.html">Da Vinci Workshop</a>,” a project to inspire greater OpenUSD use among pipeline developers.</p>
<p>The artists also used Adobe Substance Painter, Autodesk 3ds Max, Autodesk Maya, DaVinci Resolve, SideFX Houdini, Pixelogic Zbrush and Omniverse USD Composer. OpenUSD served as the backbone of the team’s internal pipeline, offering the flexibility needed to collaborate across applications with ease.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The “Da Vinci Workshop”: An OpenUSD Masterpiece" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1PkLdVwOQ1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h2><b>Powering Digital Workflows With OpenUSD</b></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://campaigns.foundry.com/products/nuke-family/whats-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15.0 and 14.1</a> updates to Nuke bring significant workflow enhancements to those working with OpenUSD.</p>
<p>The updated GeoMerge node now offers four new modes: Merge Layers, Duplicate Prims, Flatten Layers and Flatten to Single Layer. These give users greater control over geometry and OpenUSD layers, allowing for quick merging of complex structures, the duplication of workflows and more effective layer management.</p>
<p>The OpenUSD-based 3D system introduced in Nuke 14.0 enables users to handle large, intricate scenes with greater ease. And the new Scene Graph Popup feature in Nuke 15.0 allows users to easily filter through 3D scene data, reducing time and energy needed to spend searching for specific assets.</p>
<p>In addition, the main 3D scene graph now includes a search and filter feature, simplifying workspace navigation.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Nuke 15.0 | Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rQVZbxh_L1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Foundry is also embracing OpenUSD across its other products, including the latest updates to <a href="https://campaigns.foundry.com/products/katana/whats-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katana 7.0</a>, which boost pipeline efficiency by integrating USD-native workflows already aligned with Nuke’s 3D system architecture.</p>

<h2><b>Winter Tinker</b></h2>
<p>Gilmour, this week’s featured NVIDIA Studio artist, grew up in the beautiful winters of Appleton, Wisconsin. It’s no surprise he conjured up chillingly beautiful winter worlds to share with his friends, family and the creative community — fueled by his passion for 3D art.</p>
<p>Shared as long-form videos, these winter wonderlands showcase breathtakingly photorealistic details.</p>
<p>His winter video compilation — featuring “Campfire on a Winter Cliff,” “Dickensian Christmas Reading Nook” and “Northern Lights” — is designed to offer viewers a sense of peace and relaxation while encouraging self-reflection.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Cozy Bed in A-Frame Cabin | Rain Ambience ASMR" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zr77eGeSZac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Gilmour began his creative workflows in Unreal Engine, building out the environments. He used the Ultra Dynamic Sky system plug-in by game developer Everett Gunther, which offered greater flexibility and more customization options to achieve the effects in this northern lights scene.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Wolves and The Northern Lights | Winter Campfire Ambience" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jRImnRwDbj8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Fully built models are available in Unreal Engine, but to achieve further customization, Gilmour created custom 3D meshes in Blender. He used Blender Cycles’ <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a>-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport for interactive, photorealistic rendering — all powered by his <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3060-3060ti/">GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card</a>.</p>
<p>“Originally, I chose an NVIDIA RTX GPU because of its CUDA core integration in Blender’s Cycles rendering engine,” said Gilmour. “Now with ray-tracing capabilities in Unreal Engine 5, it’s a no-brainer.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_68854" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68854" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68854" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w-672x362.png" alt="" width="672" height="362" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w-672x362.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w-400x216.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w-768x414.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w-835x450.png 835w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w-399x215.png 399w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w-186x100.png 186w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image4-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68854" class="wp-caption-text">Organizing assets in Unreal Engine.</figcaption></figure>
<p>He then acquired models in Quixel Megascans to block out the scene in Unreal Engine, creating a rough draft using simple, unpolished 3D shapes. This helped to keep base meshes clean, eliminating the need to create new ones in the next iteration.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68857" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68857" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68857" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w-672x364.png" alt="" width="672" height="364" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w-672x364.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w-400x217.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w-768x416.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w-830x450.png 830w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w-397x215.png 397w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w-184x100.png 184w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image14-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68857" class="wp-caption-text">Moving models in Unreal Engine.</figcaption></figure>
<p>To build the fire and glowing firewood in his “Campfire on a Winter Cliff” scene, Gilmour used the M5 VFX Vol 2 and Twinmotion Backyard Pack 2 packs from Unreal Engine. The <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk">NVIDIA PhysX </a>SDK, advanced shader support and real-time ray tracing enabled high-fidelity, interactive visualization for swift viewport movement.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Campfire on a Winter Cliff | Crackling Fire ASMR" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gX4RaW7zSqY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>By upgrading to a GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU, Gilmour could use NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation to further improve viewport interactivity by tapping AI to generate additional, high-quality frames, ensuring increased FPS rendered at lower resolution while retaining high-fidelity detail.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dickensian Reading Nook | Ambient Christmas Reading" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W70IiFUgM34?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>When finished building his scenes, Gilmour moved to Blackmagic Design’s DaVinci Resolve to color correct and add subtle film grains, lens distortion, lens reflection and glow effects. It was all GPU-accelerated, including the process of exporting final videos with the eighth-generation <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/broadcasting-guide/">NVENC encoder</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_68860" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68860" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image12-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-68860" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image12-1280w-672x365.png" alt="" width="672" height="365" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image12-1280w-672x365.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image12-1280w-400x218.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image12-1280w-768x418.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image12-1280w-828x450.png 828w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image12-1280w-395x215.png 395w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image12-1280w-184x100.png 184w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/studio-michael-gilmour-wk88-image12-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-68860" class="wp-caption-text">Color correction in DaVinci Resolve.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The final touch to Gilmour’s wintry scenes were peaceful tunes, sampled from royalty-free music database Splice.</p>
<p>All that’s left to do is kick back, relax and soak in the scenery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The Wild West had gunslingers, bank robberies and bounties — today’s digital frontier has identity theft, credit card fraud and chargebacks.</p>
<p>Cashing in on financial fraud has become a multibillion-dollar criminal enterprise. And <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> in the hands of fraudsters only promises to make this more profitable.</p>
<p>Credit card losses worldwide are expected to reach $43 billion by 2026, according to the <a href="https://nilsonreport.com/articles/card-fraud-losses-worldwide/"><i>Nilson Report</i></a>.</p>
<p>Financial fraud is perpetrated in a growing number of ways, like harvesting hacked data from the dark web for credit card theft, using generative AI for phishing personal information, and laundering money between cryptocurrency, digital wallets and fiat currencies. Many other financial schemes are lurking in the digital underworld.</p>
<p>To keep up, financial services firms are wielding AI for fraud detection. That’s because many of these digital crimes need to be halted in their tracks in real time so that consumers and financial firms can stop losses right away.</p>
<p>So how is AI used for fraud detection?</p>
<p>AI for fraud detection uses multiple machine learning models to detect anomalies in customer behaviors and connections as well as patterns of accounts and behaviors that fit fraudulent characteristics.</p>
<h2><b>Generative AI Can Be Tapped as Fraud Copilot</b></h2>
<p>Much of financial services involves text and numbers. Generative AI and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/?ncid=em-even-877400-vt46">large language models</a> (LLMs), capable of learning meaning and context, promise disruptive capabilities across industries with new levels of output and productivity. Financial services firms can harness generative AI to develop more intelligent and capable chatbots and improve fraud detection.</p>
<p>On the opposite side, bad actors can circumvent AI guardrails with crafty generative AI prompts to use it for fraud. And LLMs are delivering human-like writing, enabling fraudsters to draft more contextually relevant emails without typos and grammar mistakes. Many different tailored versions of phishing emails can be quickly created, making generative AI an excellent copilot for perpetrating scams. There are also a number of dark web tools like FraudGPT, which can exploit generative AI for cybercrimes.</p>
<p>Generative AI can be exploited for financial harm in voice authentication security measures as well. Some banks are using voice authentication to help authorize users. A banking customer’s voice can be cloned using deep fake technology if an attacker can obtain voice samples in an effort to breach such systems. The voice data can be gathered with spam phone calls that attempt to lure the call recipient into responding by voice.</p>
<p>Chatbot scams are such a problem that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/03/chatbots-deepfakes-voice-clones-ai-deception-sale">called out concerns</a> for the use of LLMs and other technology to simulate human behavior for deep fake videos and voice clones applied in imposter scams and financial fraud.</p>
<h2><b>How Is Generative AI Tackling Misuse and Fraud Detection? </b></h2>
<p>Fraud review has a powerful new tool. Workers handling manual fraud reviews can now be assisted with LLM-based assistants running RAG on the backend to tap into information from policy documents that can help expedite decision-making on whether cases are fraudulent, vastly accelerating the process.</p>
<p>LLMs are being adopted to predict the next transaction of a customer, which can help payments firms preemptively assess risks and block fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p>Generative AI also helps combat transaction fraud by improving accuracy, generating reports, reducing investigations and mitigating compliance risk.</p>
<p>Generating <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/">synthetic data</a> is another important application of generative AI for fraud prevention. Synthetic data can improve the number of data records used to train fraud detection models and increase the variety and sophistication of examples to teach the AI to recognize the latest techniques employed by fraudsters.</p>
<p>NVIDIA offers tools to help enterprises embrace generative AI to build chatbots and virtual agents with a workflow that uses <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a>. RAG enables companies to use natural language prompts to access vast datasets for information retrieval.</p>
<p>Harnessing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/ai-workflows/">NVIDIA AI workflows</a> can help accelerate building and deploying enterprise-grade capabilities to accurately produce responses for various use cases, using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/">foundation models</a>, the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a> framework, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/triton-inference-server/">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a> and GPU-accelerated vector database to deploy RAG-powered chatbots.</p>
<p>There’s an industry focus on safety to ensure generative AI isn’t easily exploited for harm. NVIDIA <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-chatbot-guardrails-nemo/">released NeMo Guardrails</a> to help ensure that intelligent applications powered by LLMs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, are accurate, appropriate, on topic and secure.</p>
<p>The open-source software is designed to help keep AI-powered applications from being exploited for fraud and other misuses.</p>
<h2><b>What Are the Benefits of AI for Fraud Detection?</b></h2>
<p>Fraud detection has been a challenge across banking, finance, retail and e-commerce.  Fraud doesn’t only hurt organizations financially, it can also do reputational harm.</p>
<p>It’s a headache for consumers, as well, when fraud models from financial services firms overreact and register false positives that shut down legitimate transactions.</p>
<p>So financial services sectors are developing more advanced models using more data to fortify themselves against losses financially and reputationally. They’re also aiming to reduce false positives in fraud detection for transactions to improve customer satisfaction and win greater share among merchants.</p>
<h2><b>Financial Services Firms Embrace AI for Identity Verification</b></h2>
<p>The financial services industry is developing AI for identity verification. AI-driven applications using deep learning with graph neural networks (GNNs), natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision can improve identity verification for know-your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements, leading to improved regulatory compliance and reduced costs.</p>
<p>Computer vision analyzes photo documentation such as drivers licenses and passports to identify fakes. At the same time, NLP reads the documents to measure the veracity of the data on the documents as the AI analyzes them to look for fraudulent records.</p>
<p>Gains in KYC and AML requirements have massive regulatory and economic implications. Financial institutions, including banks, were fined nearly $5 billion for AML, breaching sanctions as well as failures in KYC systems in 2022, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7a4821e6-96f1-475c-ae55-6401e402061f">according to the <i>Financial Times</i></a>.</p>
<h2><b>Harnessing Graph Neural Networks and NVIDIA GPUs </b></h2>
<p>GNNs have been embraced for their ability to reveal suspicious activity. They’re capable of looking at billions of records and identifying previously unknown patterns of activity to make correlations about whether an account has in the past sent a transaction to a suspicious account.</p>
<p>NVIDIA has an alliance with the Deep Graph Library team, as well as the PyTorch Geometric team, which provides a GNN framework containerized offering that includes the latest updates, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rapids">NVIDIA RAPIDS</a> libraries and more to help users stay up to date on cutting-edge techniques.</p>
<p>These GNN framework containers are NVIDIA-optimized and performance-tuned and tested to get the most out of NVIDIA GPUs.</p>
<p>With access to the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform, developers can tap into NVIDIA RAPIDS, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/triton-inference-server/">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a> and the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt">NVIDIA TensorRT</a> software development kit to support enterprise deployments at scale.</p>
<h2><b>Improving Anomaly Detection With GNNs</b></h2>
<p>Fraudsters have sophisticated techniques and can learn ways to outmaneuver fraud detection systems. One way is by unleashing complex chains of transactions to avoid notice. This is where traditional rules-based systems can miss patterns and fail.</p>
<p>GNNs build on a concept of representation within the model of local structure and feature context. The information from the edge and node features is propagated with aggregation and message passing among neighboring nodes.</p>
<p>When GNNs run multiple layers of graph convolution, the final node states contain information from nodes multiple hops away. The larger receptive field of GNNs can track the more complex and longer transaction chains used by financial fraud perpetrators in attempts to obscure their tracks.</p>
<h2><b>GNNs Enable Training Unsupervised or Self-Supervised </b></h2>
<p>Detecting financial fraud patterns at massive scale is challenged by the tens of terabytes of transaction data that needs to be analyzed in the blink of an eye and a relative lack of labeled data for real fraud activity needed to train models.</p>
<p>While GNNs can cast a wider detection net on fraud patterns, they can also train on an <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/supervised-unsupervised-learning/">unsupervised or self-supervised</a> task.</p>
<p>By using techniques such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06514">Bootstrapped Graph Latents</a> — a graph representation learning method — or <a href="https://graph-neural-networks.github.io/static/file/chapter10.pdf">link prediction with negative sampling</a>, GNN developers can pretrain models without labels and fine-tune models with far fewer labels, producing strong graph representations. The output of this can be used for models like XGBoost, GNNs or techniques for clustering, offering better results when deployed for inference.</p>
<h2><b>Tackling Model Explainability and Bias</b></h2>
<p>GNNs also enable model explainability with a suite of tools. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-explainable-ai/">Explainable AI</a> is an industry practice that enables organizations to use such tools and techniques to explain how AI models make decisions, allowing them to safeguard against bias.</p>
<p>Heterogeneous graph transformer and graph attention network, which are GNN models, enable attention mechanisms across each layer of the GNN, allowing developers to identify message paths that GNNs use to reach a final output.</p>
<p>Even without an attention mechanism, techniques such as <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/gnnexplainer-neurips19.pdf">GNNExplainer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/flyingdoog/PGExplainer">PGExplainer</a> and <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=WznmQa42ZAx">GraphMask</a> have been suggested to explain GNN outputs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Zipline isn’t just some pie-in-the-sky drone startup.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company has completed more than 850,000 deliveries in seven countries since its start in 2011. It recently added services for Seattle’s Pagliacci Pizza, vitamin and supplement giant GNC, and large health systems like Intermountain Health, OhioHealth and Michigan Medicine.</p>
<p>Zipline developed its drones — which have now flown more than 65 million miles — for autonomous navigation and precision landings using the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/?ncid=pa-srch-goog-680280">NVIDIA Jetson</a> edge AI and robotics platform.</p>
<p>The fast-growing company recently landed $330 million in funding at a more than $4 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Zipline is a member of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a>, a program that provides startups with technological support and AI platform guidance.</p>
<h2><b>Delivering With Jetson-Powered Fleets</b></h2>
<p>The company’s P1 drone, or platform one, has been deployed in production for seven years and currently uses the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/">Jetson Xavier NX</a> system-on-module to process its sensor inputs. It’s guided by GPS, air traffic control communications, inertial measurement unit sensors and its onboard detection and avoidance system, with redundancy of guidance for safety.</p>
<p>“The NVIDIA Jetson module in the wing is part of what delivers our acoustic detection and avoidance system, so it allows us to listen for other aircraft in the airspace around us and plot trajectories that avoid any conflict,” said A.J. Frantz, navigation lead at Zipline.</p>
<p>The company’s fixed-wing drones can fly out more than 55 miles, at 70 miles per hour, for deliveries from one of several Zipline distribution centers and then return. Capable of hauling up to four pounds of cargo, they autonomously fly over delivery locations and release packages that float down to their destination by parachute.</p>
<p>The company’s P2, or platform two, is a hybrid drone that can fly fast on fixed-wing flights — but also hover. It can carry eight pounds of cargo for 10 miles and packs a droid that can be lowered on a tether to complete deliveries with precision placement. It’s intended for use in dense, urban environments.</p>
<p>The P2 uses two <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">Jetson Orin NX</a> modules. One is for the drone’s sensor fusion system to understand environments. The other is in the droid that descends by tether — for redundancy to provide added safety.</p>
<p>“The P2 droid is about bringing the smallest, quickest, safest, quietest drone in for delivery, coming down precisely and leaving the package — and then going back up,” said Joseph Mardall, head of engineering at Zipline. “We want to integrate into people’s lives in a way that they love and that feels magical.”</p>
<p>Zipline completes one delivery every 70 seconds globally.</p>

<h2><b>Flying Away With a Roster of Customers</b></h2>
<p>Zipline’s service offers advantages that are attracting customers. Its drones, fondly nicknamed ‘Zips,’ are capable of 7x faster delivery times compared with vehicle deliveries, according to the company.</p>
<p>“Our aircraft fly at 70 miles per hour, as the crow flies, so no traffic, no waiting at lights — we’re talking minutes here in terms of delivery times,” said Mardall. “Single-digit minutes are common for deliveries, so it’s faster than any alternative, for sure.”</p>
<p>In addition to services for pizza, vitamins and courier meds, Zipline works with Walmart, restaurant chain Sweetgreen, Michigan Medicine, MultiCare Health Systems, Intermountain Health and the government of Rwanda, among others. It also delivers to more than 4,000 hospitals and health centers, according to the company.</p>
<p>Zipline started its service delivering blood in Rwanda seven years ago and later expanded into food and convenience.</p>
<h2><b>Riding Jetson Orin for Energy Efficiency, Environmental Benefits </b></h2>
<p>Delivering energy-efficient computing is mission-critical for the run-time of autonomous machines, used in everything from delivery services and agriculture to mining and undersea exploration. NVIDIA Jetson Orin modules offer up to 275 trillion operations per second while providing market-leading energy efficiency.</p>
<p>“You can pick the right place for your algorithms to run to make sure you’re getting the most out of the hardware and the power that you are putting into the system,” said Frantz.</p>
<p>Startups using Jetson-driven applications are also leading the way in sustainability, as more next-generation electric-driven autonomous machines replace those contributing to pollution.</p>
<p>Deliveries by Zipline offer a 97% reduction in carbon emissions compared with gasoline-driven vehicles, according to the company.</p>
<p>“We are super excited to significantly reduce carbon emissions,” said Mardall. “And when building an electric aircraft, efficiency is totally key — every watt, every fraction of a watt, every joule that we can claw back can be turned into payload and range.”</p>
