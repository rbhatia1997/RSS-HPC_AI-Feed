										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Across industries, AI is supercharging innovation with machine-powered computation. In finance, bankers are using AI to detect fraud more quickly and keep accounts safe, telecommunications providers are improving networks to deliver superior service, scientists are developing novel treatments for rare diseases, utility companies are building cleaner, more reliable energy grids and automotive companies are making self-driving cars safer and more accessible.</p>
<p>The backbone of top AI use cases is data. Effective and precise AI models require training on extensive datasets. Enterprises seeking to harness the power of AI must establish a data pipeline that involves extracting data from diverse sources, transforming it into a consistent format and storing it efficiently.</p>
<p>Data scientists work to refine datasets through multiple experiments to fine-tune AI models for optimal performance in real-world applications. These applications, from voice assistants to personalized recommendation systems, require rapid processing of large data volumes to deliver real-time performance.</p>
<p>As AI models become more complex and begin to handle diverse data types such as text, audio, images, and video, the need for rapid data processing becomes more critical. Organizations that continue to rely on legacy CPU-based computing are struggling with hampered innovation and performance due to data bottlenecks, escalating data center costs, and insufficient computing capabilities.</p>
<p>Many businesses are turning to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/">accelerated computing</a> to integrate AI into their operations. This method leverages GPUs, specialized hardware, software, and parallel computing techniques to boost computing performance by as much as 150x and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gpu-energy-efficiency-nersc/">increase energy efficiency by up to 42x</a>.</p>
<p>Leading companies across different sectors are using accelerated data processing to spearhead groundbreaking AI initiatives.</p>
<h2><b>Finance Organizations Detect Fraud in a Fraction of a Second</b></h2>
<p>Financial organizations face a significant challenge in detecting patterns of fraud due to the vast amount of transactional data that requires rapid analysis. Additionally, the scarcity of labeled data for actual instances of fraud poses a difficulty in training AI models. Conventional data science pipelines lack the required acceleration to handle the large data volumes associated with fraud detection. This leads to slower processing times that hinder real-time data analysis and fraud detection capabilities.</p>
<p>To overcome these challenges, <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-financial-services-industry/american-express-adopts-ai">American Express</a>, which handles more than 8 billion transactions per year, uses accelerated computing to train and deploy long short-term memory (LSTM) models. These models excel in sequential analysis and detection of anomalies, and can adapt and learn from new data, making them ideal for combating fraud.</p>
<p>Leveraging parallel computing techniques on GPUs, American Express significantly speeds up the training of its LSTM models. GPUs also enable live models to process huge volumes of transactional data to make high-performance computations to detect fraud in real time.</p>
<p>The system operates within two milliseconds of latency to better protect customers and merchants, delivering a 50x improvement over a CPU-based configuration. By combining the accelerated LSTM deep neural network with its existing methods, American Express has improved fraud detection accuracy by up to 6% in specific segments.</p>
<p>Financial companies can also use accelerated computing to reduce data processing costs. Running data-heavy Spark3 workloads on NVIDIA GPUs, PayPal confirmed the potential to <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-financial-services-industry/gtc24-s62506">reduce cloud costs by up to 70%</a> for big data processing and AI applications.</p>
<p>By processing data more efficiently, financial institutions can detect fraud in real time, enabling faster decision-making without disrupting transaction flow and minimizing the risk of financial loss.</p>
<h2><b>Telcos Simplify Complex Routing Operations</b></h2>
<p>Telecommunications providers generate immense amounts of data from various sources, including network devices, customer interactions, billing systems, and network performance and maintenance.</p>
<p>Managing national networks that handle hundreds of petabytes of data every day requires complex technician routing to ensure service delivery. To optimize technician dispatch, advanced routing engines perform trillions of computations, taking into account factors like weather, technician skills, customer requests and fleet distribution. Success in these operations depends on meticulous data preparation and sufficient computing power.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T, which operates one of the nation’s largest field dispatch teams to service its customers, is enhancing data-heavy routing operations with NVIDIA cuOpt, which relies on heuristics, metaheuristics and optimizations to calculate complex vehicle routing problems.</p>
<p>In early trials, <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/at-t-supercharges-operations-with-nvidia-ai">cuOpt delivered routing solutions in 10 seconds</a>, achieving a 90% reduction in cloud costs and enabling technicians to complete more service calls daily. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/software/rapids/">NVIDIA RAPIDS</a>, a suite of software libraries that enables acceleration of data science and analytics pipelines, further accelerates cuOpt, allowing companies to integrate local search heuristics and metaheuristics like Tabu search for continuous route optimization.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T is adopting <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/apache-spark-3/">NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark</a> to enhance the performance of Spark-based AI and data pipelines. This has helped the company boost operational efficiency on everything from training AI models to maintaining network quality to reducing customer churn and improving fraud detection. With RAPIDS Accelerator, AT&amp;T is reducing its cloud computing spend for target workloads while enabling faster performance and reducing its carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Accelerated data pipelines and processing will be critical as telcos seek to improve operational efficiency while delivering the highest possible service quality.</p>
<h2><b>Biomedical Researchers Condense Drug Discovery Timelines</b></h2>
<p>As researchers utilize technology to study the roughly 25,000 genes in the human genome to understand their relationship with diseases, there has been an explosion of medical data and peer-reviewed research papers. Biomedical researchers rely on these papers to narrow down the field of study for novel treatments. However, conducting literature reviews of such a massive and expanding body of relevant research has become an impossible task.</p>
<p>AstraZeneca, a leading pharmaceutical company, developed a Biological Insights Knowledge Graph (BIKG) to aid scientists across the drug discovery process, from literature reviews to screen hit rating, target identification and more. This graph integrates public and internal databases with information from scientific literature, modeling between 10 million and 1 billion complex biological relationships.</p>
<p>BIKG has been effectively used for gene ranking, aiding scientists in hypothesizing high-potential targets for novel disease treatments. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcfall21-a31252/">At NVIDIA GTC</a>, the AstraZeneca team presented a project that successfully identified genes linked to resistance in lung cancer treatments.</p>
<p>To narrow down potential genes, data scientists and biological researchers collaborated to define the criteria and gene features ideal for targeting in treatment development. They trained a machine learning algorithm to search the BIKG databases for genes with the designated features mentioned in literature as treatable. Utilizing NVIDIA RAPIDS for faster computations, the team reduced the initial gene pool from 3,000 to just 40 target genes, a task that previously took months but now takes mere seconds.</p>
<p>By supplementing drug development with accelerated computing and AI, pharmaceutical companies and researchers can finally use the enormous troves of data building up in the medical field to develop novel drugs faster and more safely, ultimately having a life-saving impact.</p>
<h2><b>Utility Companies Build the Future of Clean Energy </b></h2>
<p>There’s been a significant push to shift to carbon-neutral energy sources in the energy sector. With the cost of harnessing renewable resources such as solar energy falling drastically over the last 10 years, the opportunity to make real progress toward a clean energy future has never been greater.</p>
<p>However, this shift toward integrating clean energy from wind farms, solar farms and home batteries has introduced new complexities in grid management. As energy infrastructure diversifies and two-way power flows must be accommodated, managing the grid has become more data-intensive. New smart grids are now required to handle high-voltage areas for vehicle charging. They must also manage the availability of distributed stored energy sources and adapt to variations in usage across the network.</p>
<p><a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-energy-utilities/gtc24-s61864">Utilidata, a prominent grid-edge software company</a>, has collaborated with NVIDIA to develop a distributed AI platform, Karman, for the grid edge using a custom NVIDIA Jetson Orin edge AI module. This custom chip and platform, embedded in electricity meters, transforms each meter into a data collection and control point, capable of handling thousands of data points per second.</p>
<p>Karman processes real-time, high-resolution data from meters at the network’s edge. This enables utility companies to gain detailed insights into grid conditions, predict usage and seamlessly integrate distributed energy resources in seconds, rather than minutes or hours. Additionally, with inference models on edge devices, network operators can anticipate and quickly identify line faults to predict potential outages and conduct preventative maintenance to increase grid reliability.</p>
<p>Through the integration of AI and accelerated data analytics, Karman helps utility providers transform existing infrastructure into efficient smart grids. This allows for tailored, localized electricity distribution to meet fluctuating demand patterns without extensive physical infrastructure upgrades, facilitating a more cost-effective modernization of the grid.</p>
<h2><b>Automakers Enable Safer, More Accessible, Self-Driving Vehicles</b></h2>
<p>As auto companies strive for full self-driving capabilities, vehicles must be able to detect objects and navigate in real time. This requires high-speed data processing tasks, including feeding live data from cameras, lidar, radar and GPS into AI models that make navigation decisions to keep roads safe.</p>
<p>The autonomous driving inference workflow is complex and includes multiple AI models along with necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps. Traditionally, these steps were handled on the client side using CPUs. However, this can lead to significant bottlenecks in processing speeds, which is an unacceptable drawback for an application where fast processing equates to safety.</p>
<p>To enhance the efficiency of autonomous driving workflows, <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-automotive-resource-library/nio">electric vehicle manufacturer NIO</a> integrated NVIDIA Triton Inference Server into its inference pipeline. NVIDIA Triton is open-source, multi-framework, inference-serving software. By centralizing data processing tasks, NIO reduced latency by 6x in some core areas and increased overall data throughput by up to 5x.</p>
<p>NIO’s GPU-centric approach made it easier to update and deploy new AI models without the need to change anything on the vehicles themselves. Additionally, the company could use multiple AI models at the same time on the same set of images without having to send data back and forth over a network, which saved on data transfer costs and improved performance.</p>
<p>By using accelerated data processing, autonomous vehicle software developers ensure they can reach a high-performance standard to avoid traffic accidents, lower transportation costs and improve mobility for users.</p>
<h2><b>Retailers Improve Demand Forecasting</b></h2>
<p>In the fast-paced retail environment, the ability to process and analyze data quickly is critical to adjusting inventory levels, personalizing customer interactions and optimizing pricing strategies on the fly. The larger a retailer is and the more products it carries, the more complex and compute-intensive its data operations will be.</p>
<p>Walmart, the largest retailer in the world, turned to accelerated computing to significantly improve forecasting accuracy for 500 million item-by-store combinations across 4,500 stores.</p>
<p>As Walmart’s data science team built more robust machine learning algorithms to take on this mammoth forecasting challenge, the existing computing environment began to falter, with jobs failing to complete or generating inaccurate results. The company found that data scientists were having to remove features from algorithms just so they would run to completion.</p>
<p>To improve its forecasting operations, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/walmart-nvidia/">Walmart started using NVIDIA GPUs and RAPIDs</a>. The company now uses a forecasting model with 350 data features to predict sales across all product categories. These features encompass sales data, promotional events, and external factors like weather conditions and major events like the Super Bowl, which influence demand.</p>
<p>Advanced models helped Walmart improve forecast accuracy from 94% to 97% while eliminating an estimated $100 million in fresh produce waste and reducing stockout and markdown scenarios. GPUs also ran models 100x faster with jobs complete in just four hours, an operation that would’ve taken several weeks in a CPU environment.</p>
<p>By shifting data-intensive operations to GPUs and accelerated computing, retailers can lower both their cost and their carbon footprint while delivering best-fit choices and lower prices to shoppers.</p>
<h2><b>Public Sector Improves Disaster Preparedness </b></h2>
<p>Drones and satellites capture huge amounts of aerial image data that public and private organizations use to predict weather patterns, track animal migrations and observe environmental changes. This data is invaluable for research and planning, enabling more informed decision-making in fields like agriculture, disaster management and efforts to combat climate change. However, the value of this imagery can be limited if it lacks specific location metadata.</p>
<p>A federal agency working with NVIDIA needed a way to automatically pinpoint the location of images missing geospatial metadata, which is essential for missions such as search and rescue, responding to natural disasters and monitoring the environment. However, identifying a small area within a larger region using an aerial image without metadata is extremely challenging, akin to locating a needle in a haystack. Algorithms designed to help with geolocation must address variations in image lighting and differences due to images being taken at various times, dates and angles.</p>
<p>To identify non-geotagged aerial images, NVIDIA, Booz Allen and the government agency collaborated on a solution that uses computer vision algorithms to extract information from image pixel data to scale the image similarity search problem.</p>
<p>When attempting to solve this problem, an NVIDIA solutions architect first used a Python-based application. Initially running on CPUs, processing took more than 24 hours. GPUs supercharged this to just minutes, performing thousands of data operations in parallel versus only a handful of operations on a CPU. By shifting the application code to CuPy, an open-sourced GPU-accelerated library, the application experienced a remarkable 1.8-million-x speedup, returning results in 67 microseconds.</p>
<p>With a solution that can process images and the data of large land masses in just minutes, organizations can gain access to the critical information needed to respond more quickly and effectively to emergencies and plan proactively, potentially saving lives and safeguarding the environment.</p>
<h2><b>Accelerate AI Initiatives and Deliver Business Results</b></h2>
<p>Companies using accelerated computing for data processing are advancing AI initiatives and positioning themselves to innovate and perform at higher levels than their peers.</p>
<p>Accelerated computing handles larger datasets more efficiently, enables faster model training and selection of optimal algorithms, and facilitates more precise results for live AI solutions.</p>
<p>Enterprises that use it can achieve superior price-performance ratios compared to traditional CPU-based systems and enhance their ability to deliver outstanding results and experiences to customers, employees and partners.</p>

<h2><b>Catch Some Rays</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS</a> 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction enhances ray-traced image quality on NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX GPUs by replacing hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.</p>
<p>Previewing content in the viewport, even with high-end hardware, can sometimes offer less-than-ideal image quality, as traditional denoisers require hand-tuning for every scene. With DLSS 3.5, the AI neural network recognizes a wide variety of scenes, producing high-quality preview images and drastically reducing time spent rendering.</p>
<p>The free browser-based 3D modeling platform <a href="https://beta.womp.com/discover?preview=777651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Womp has added DLSS 3.5</a> to enhance interactive, photorealistic modeling in the viewport.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>German enterprise cloud leader SAP is harnessing generative AI and industrial digital twins in the development of next-generation enterprise applications for its customers.</p>
<p>At SAP’s Sapphire event today, in Orlando, Florida, NVIDIA and the enterprise software company unveiled generative AI efforts featuring <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software to offer two new capabilities for <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html">Joule</a>, SAP’s generative AI copilot — SAP Consulting capabilities and ABAP Developer capabilities.</p>
<p>To help streamline the selling and buying process of complex products, SAP is also integrating <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/cloud/">NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud</a> application programming interfaces, or APIs, into its Intelligent Product Recommendation solution. This will enable salespeople to visualize 3D product digital twins directly in SAP Intelligent Product Recommendation. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, based on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">OpenUSD</a>, lets users simulate how configurable equipment might physically fit into and operate in the real world, saving time and costs while improving efficiency and safety.</p>
<p>These new advances come after the <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/sap-nvidia-generative-ai-enterprise-applications">companies announced AI-focused collaborations</a> at GTC in March.</p>
<p>“One of the most amazing breakthroughs in large language models and generative AI is that we&#8217;ve managed to learn the representation of almost any language,” said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang, speaking by video link at the SAP Sapphire conference. “In our company, the most valuable language is CUDA. At SAP, the most valuable language is ABAP.”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve created some amazing generative APIs that understand the language of SAP, that understand the language of supply chains, that understand the language of ERP systems, so that we have a specialist, an agent and AI to help us to do all the things that we want to do to manage our business,” said SAP CEO Christian Klein.</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA AI Helps to Accelerate Joule, SAP’s Generative AI Copilot  </b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html">Joule</a>, which is embedded across SAP’s portfolio of cloud solutions and applications, allows users to work faster while gaining smarter insights grounded in business data. At SAP Sapphire, the company announced a new consulting capability for Joule leveraging NVIDIA NeMo Retriever microservices.</p>
<p>NVIDIA NeMo Retriever connects AI applications with proprietary data to drive <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, or RAG. This brings domain expertise and knowledge of the business to LLMs so that AI copilots and coding assistants can give more accurate and relevant responses.</p>
<p>With the new AI-powered SAP Consulting capabilities — connected to 200,000 pages of SAP learning content, help, product documentation, and community content — tens of thousands of SAP consultants can be more productive, while accessing the latest product and process details when working with end customers. Joule’s SAP Consulting capabilities are already being previewed by internal SAP consultants as well as leading system integrators.</p>
<p>NVIDIA-powered AI is also coming to assist the more than 5 million developers using SAP’s ABAP programming language. SAP’s custom model was trained on over 250 million lines of proprietary ABAP code using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/hgx/">NVIDIA HGX H100</a> systems and will be deployed using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> inference microservices for optimal runtime performance. Joule’s ABAP Developer capabilities can help developers generate, complete and explain code as well as create software unit tests, which allows them to spend more time building and deploying features rather than manually writing lines of code.</p>
<p>As announced at GTC 2024, this NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, including NeMo and NIM, is expected to be accessible in the generative AI hub in SAP AI Core for developers and customers to leverage.</p>
<h2><b>Omniverse to Help Optimize Sales Processes for Complex Products</b></h2>
<p>Using NVIDIA AI and Omniverse, SAP is building the future of connectivity and is reimagining key business processes, including the sales process for manufacturers.</p>
<p>SAP Intelligent Product Recommendation software utilizes generative AI to analyze requirements described in natural language and generate recommendations for the most suitable configurable products. With Omniverse Cloud APIs integrated with the application, users can then interact with physically accurate models of complex products in a digital twin of the environment where they will be installed. This lets sales teams generate quotes more quickly and helps sales representatives recommend the best solutions for their customers’ needs.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Building the Future of Connectivity With SAP Using Generative AI and 3D Product Digital Twins" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/flBI6BOvun8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In addition, SAP Intelligent Product Recommendation can use NVIDIA AI to analyze text from multiple sources, including emails and notes captured in customer relationship management software or from product specifications documents. This lets the software generate  recommendations based on key, custom parameters, such as power requirements, lead times and expected carbon footprint.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>AI gives every company an opportunity to turn its processes into a data flywheel, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang told thousands of attendees Monday at the <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/summit/">Snowflake Data Cloud Summit</a>.</p>
<p>Companies need to “take all the most important processes they do, capture them in a data flywheel and turn that into the company’s AI to drive that flywheel even further,” said Huang, joining from Taipei a virtual fireside chat with Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The two executives described how the combination of the Snowflake AI Data Cloud and NVIDIA AI will simplify and accelerate enterprise AI.</p>
<p>“You want to jump on this train as fast as you can. Don’t let it fly by because you can use it to transform your business or go into new businesses,” said Huang, the day after he gave <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/computex-2024-jensen-huang/">a keynote</a> kicking off COMPUTEX in Taiwan.</p>
<h2>Snowflake Users Can Tap Into NVIDIA AI Enterprise</h2>
<p>For example, businesses will be able to deploy Snowflake Arctic, an enterprise-focused large language model (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">LLM</a>), in seconds using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> inference microservices, part of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform. <b></b></p>
<p>Arctic was trained on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> and is available on the <a href="http://ai.nvidia.com/">NVIDIA API catalog</a>, fully supported by <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-supercharges-large-language-model-inference-on-nvidia-h100-gpus/">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a>, software that accelerates generative AI inference.<b></b></p>
<p>The two companies also will integrate <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/cortex/">Snowflake Cortex AI</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/nemo/">NVIDIA NeMo Retriever</a>, so businesses can link their AI-powered applications to information sources, ensuring highly accurate results with retrieval-augmented generation (<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">RAG</a>).<b></b></p>
<p>Ramaswamy gave examples of generative AI applications developed with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/nemo/">NVIDIA NeMo</a> framework and <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/snowpark-container-services-deploy-genai-full-stack-apps/">Snowpark Container Services</a> that will be available on <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/marketplace/">Snowflake Marketplace</a> for use by thousands of Snowflake customers.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA’s industry-leading accelerated computing is game changing for our customers and our own research team that used it to create the state-of-the-art Artic model for our customers,” said Ramaswamy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>European neobank <a href="https://www.bunq.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bunq</a> is debunking financial fraudsters with the help of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI.</p>
<p>Dubbed “the bank of the free,” bunq offers online banking anytime, anywhere. Through the bunq app, users can handle all their financial needs exclusively online, without needing to visit a physical bank.</p>
<p>With more than 12 million customers and 8 billion euros’ worth of deposits made to date, bunq has become one of the largest neobanks in the European Union. Founded in 2012, it was the first bank to obtain a European banking license in over three decades.</p>
<p>To meet growing customer needs, bunq turned to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> to help <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-fraud-detection-rapids-triton-tensorrt-nemo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detect fraud and money laundering</a>. Its automated transaction-monitoring system, powered by NVIDIA accelerated computing, greatly improved its training speed.</p>
<p>“AI has enormous potential to help humanity in so many ways, and this is a great example of how human intelligence can be coupled with AI,” said Ali el Hassouni, head of data and AI at bunq.</p>
<h2><b>Faster Fraud Detection</b></h2>
<p>Financial fraud is more prevalent than ever, el Hassouni said in a recent <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62593/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk at NVIDIA GTC</a>.</p>
<p>Traditional transaction-monitoring systems are rules based, meaning algorithms flag suspicious transactions according to a set of criteria that determine if an activity presents risk of fraud or money laundering. These criteria must be manually set, resulting in high false-positive rates and making such systems labor intensive and difficult to scale.</p>
<p>Instead, using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/supervised-unsupervised-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supervised and unsupervised learning</a>, bunq’s AI-powered transaction-monitoring system is completely automated and easily scalable.</p>
<p>Bunq achieved this using NVIDIA GPUs, which accelerated its data processing pipeline more than 5x.</p>
<p>In addition, compared with previous methods, bunq trained its fraud-detection model nearly 100x faster using the open-source <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rapids" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RAPIDS</a> suite of GPU-accelerated data science libraries.</p>
<p>RAPIDS is part of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform, which accelerates data science pipelines and streamlines the development and deployment of production-grade generative AI applications.</p>
<p>“We chose NVIDIA’s advanced, GPU-optimized software, as it enables us to use larger datasets and speed the training of new models — sometimes by an order of magnitude — resulting in improved model accuracy and reduced false positives,” said el Hassouni.</p>
<h2><b>AI Across the Bank</b></h2>
<p>Bunq is seeking to tap AI’s potential across its operations.</p>
<p>“We’re constantly looking for new ways to apply AI for the benefit of our users,” el Hassouni said. “More than half of our user tickets are handled automatically. We also use AI to spot fake IDs when onboarding new users, automate our marketing efforts and much more.”</p>
<p>Finn, a personal AI assistant available to bunq customers, is powered by the company’s proprietary <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language model</a> and generative AI. It can answer user questions like, “How much did I spend on groceries last month?” and “What’s the name of the Indian restaurant I ate at last week?”</p>
<p>The company is exploring <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/translate-your-enterprise-data-into-actionable-insights-with-nvidia-nemo-retriever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA NeMo Retriever</a>, a collection of generative AI microservices available in <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-microservices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early access</a>, to further improve Finn’s accuracy. NeMo Retriever is a part of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA NIM</a> inference microservices, which provide models as optimized containers, available with NVIDIA AI Enterprise.</p>
<p>“Our initial testing of NeMo Retriever embedding NIM has been extremely positive, and our collaboration with NVIDIA on LLMs is poised to help us to take Finn to the next level and enhance customer experience,” el Hassouni said.</p>
<p>Plus, for the digital bank’s marketing efforts, AI helps analyze consumer engagement metrics to inform future campaigns.</p>
<p>“We’re creating a borderless banking experience for our users, always keeping them at the heart of everything we do,” el Hassouni said.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pKXDVsWZmUU?si=bYffxIwUxYMev6hK" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>‘One-Year Rhythm’</h2>
<p>More’s coming, with Huang revealing a roadmap for new semiconductors that will arrive on a one-year rhythm. Revealed for the first time, the Rubin platform will succeed the upcoming Blackwell platform, featuring new GPUs, a new Arm-based CPU — Vera — and advanced networking with NVLink 6, CX9 SuperNIC and the X1600 converged InfiniBand/Ethernet switch.</p>
<p>“Our company has a one-year rhythm. Our basic philosophy is very simple: build the entire data center scale, disaggregate and sell to you parts on a one-year rhythm, and push everything to technology limits,” Huang explained.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s creative team used AI tools from members of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a> startup program, built on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a> and NVIDIA’s accelerated computing, to create the COMPUTEX keynote. Packed with demos, this showcase highlighted these innovative tools and the transformative impact of NVIDIA’s technology.</p>
<h2>‘Accelerated Computing Is Sustainable Computing’</h2>
<p>NVIDIA is driving down the cost of turning data into intelligence, Huang explained as he began his talk.</p>
<p>“Accelerated computing is sustainable computing,” he emphasized, outlining how the combination of GPUs and CPUs can deliver up to a 100x speedup while only increasing power consumption by a factor of three, achieving 25x more performance per Watt over CPUs alone.</p>
<p>“The more you buy, the more you save,” Huang noted, highlighting this approach’s significant cost and energy savings.</p>
<h2>Industry Joins NVIDIA to Build AI Factories to Power New Industrial Revolution</h2>
<p>Leading computer manufacturers, particularly from Taiwan, the global IT hub, have embraced NVIDIA GPUs and networking solutions. Top companies include <a href="https://www.asrockrack.com/general/news.asp?id=239">ASRock Rack</a>, <a href="https://servers.asus.com/NEWS/ASUS-Presents-ESC-AI-POD-with-NVIDIA-GB200-NVL72-at-Computex-2024">ASUS</a>, <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Press/News/2168">GIGABYTE</a>, Ingrasys, Inventec, <a href="https://svr.pegatroncorp.com/News/6">Pegatron</a>, QCT, Supermicro, Wistron and Wiwynn, which are creating cloud, on-premises and edge AI systems.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA MGX modular reference design platform now supports Blackwell, including the GB200 NVL2 platform, designed for optimal performance in large language model inference, retrieval-augmented generation and data processing.</p>
<p>AMD and Intel are supporting the MGX architecture with plans to deliver, for the first time, their own CPU host processor module designs. Any server system builder can use these reference designs to save development time while ensuring consistency in design and performance.</p>
<h2>Next-Generation Networking with Spectrum-X</h2>
<p>In networking, Huang unveiled plans for the <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-supercharges-ethernet-networking-for-generative-ai">annual release of Spectrum-X products</a> to cater to the growing demand for high-performance Ethernet networking for AI.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Spectrum-X, the first Ethernet fabric built for AI, enhances network performance by 1.6x more than traditional Ethernet fabrics. It accelerates the processing, analysis and execution of AI workloads and, in turn, the development and deployment of AI solutions.</p>
<p>CoreWeave, GMO Internet Group, Lambda, Scaleway, STPX Global and Yotta are among the first AI cloud service providers embracing Spectrum-X to bring extreme networking performance to their AI infrastructures.</p>
<h2>NVIDIA NIM to Transform Millions Into Gen AI Developers</h2>
<p>With <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-nim-model-deployment-generative-ai-developers">NVIDIA NIM</a>, the world’s 28 million developers can now easily create generative AI applications. NIM — inference microservices that provide models as optimized containers — can be deployed on clouds, data centers or workstations.</p>
<p>NIM also enables enterprises to maximize their infrastructure investments. For example, running Meta Llama 3-8B in a NIM produces up to 3x more generative AI tokens on accelerated infrastructure than without NIM.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Deploying generative AI in the enterprise is about to get easier than ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA NIM</a>, a set of generative AI inference microservices, works with <a href="https://kserve.github.io/website/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KServe</a>, open-source software that automates putting AI models to work at the scale of a cloud computing application.</p>
<p>The combination ensures <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> can be deployed like any other large enterprise application. It also makes NIM widely available through platforms from dozens of companies, such as Canonical, Nutanix and Red Hat.</p>
<p>The integration of NIM on KServe extends NVIDIA’s technologies to the open-source community, ecosystem partners and customers. Through NIM, they can all access the performance, support and security of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform with an API call — the push-button of modern programming.</p>
<h2><b>Serving AI on Kubernetes</b></h2>
<p>KServe got its start as part of Kubeflow, a machine learning toolkit based on Kubernetes, the open-source system for deploying and managing software containers that hold all the components of large distributed applications.</p>
<p>As Kubeflow expanded its work on AI inference, what became KServe was born and ultimately evolved into its own open-source project.</p>
<p>Many companies have contributed to and adopted the KServe software that runs today at companies including AWS, Bloomberg, Canonical, Cisco, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Red Hat, Zillow and NVIDIA.</p>
<h2><b>Under the Hood With KServe</b></h2>
<p>KServe is essentially an extension of Kubernetes that runs AI inference like a powerful cloud application. It uses a standard protocol, runs with optimized performance and supports PyTorch, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow and XGBoost without users needing to know the details of those AI frameworks.</p>
<p>The software is especially useful these days, when new large language models (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LLMs</a>) are emerging rapidly.</p>
<p>KServe lets users easily go back and forth from one model to another, testing which one best suits their needs. And when an updated version of a model gets released, a KServe feature called “canary rollouts” automates the job of carefully validating and gradually deploying it into production.</p>
<p>Another feature, GPU autoscaling, efficiently manages how models are deployed as demand for a service ebbs and flows, so customers and service providers have the best possible experience.</p>
<h2><b>An API Call to Generative AI</b></h2>
<p>The goodness of KServe is now available with the ease of NVIDIA NIM.</p>
<p>With NIM, a simple API call takes care of all the complexities. Enterprise IT admins get the metrics they need to ensure their application is running with optimal performance and efficiency, whether it’s in their data center or on a remote cloud service — even if they change the AI models they’re using.</p>
<p>NIM lets IT professionals become generative AI pros, transforming their company’s operations. That’s why a host of enterprises such as Foxconn and ServiceNow are <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-nim-model-deployment-generative-ai-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deploying NIM microservices</a>.</p>
<h2><b>NIM Rides Dozens of Kubernetes Platforms</b></h2>
<p>Thanks to its integration with KServe, users will be able access NIM on dozens of enterprise platforms such as Canonical’s Charmed KubeFlow and Charmed Kubernetes, <a href="https://ir.nutanix.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nutanix-and-nvidia-collaborate-accelerate-enterprise-ai-adoption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nutanix GPT-in-a-Box 2.0</a>, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/03/15/empower-conversational-ai-scale-kserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Hat’s OpenShift AI</a> and many others.</p>
<p>“Red Hat has been working with NVIDIA to make it easier than ever for enterprises to deploy AI using open source technologies,” said KServe contributor Yuan Tang, a principal software engineer at Red Hat. “By enhancing KServe and adding support for NIM in Red Hat OpenShift AI, we’re able to provide streamlined access to NVIDIA’s generative AI platform for Red Hat customers.”</p>
<p>“Through the integration of NVIDIA NIM inference microservices with Nutanix GPT-in-a-Box 2.0, customers will be able to build scalable, secure, high-performance generative AI applications in a consistent way, from the cloud to the edge,” said the vice president of engineering at Nutanix, Debojyoti Dutta, whose team contributes to KServe and Kubeflow.</p>
<p>“As a company that also contributes significantly to KServe, we’re pleased to offer NIM through Charmed Kubernetes and Charmed Kubeflow,” said Andreea Munteanu, MLOps product manager at Canonical. “Users will be able to access the full power of generative AI, with the highest performance, efficiency and ease thanks to the combination of our efforts.”</p>
<p>Dozens of other software providers can feel the benefits of NIM simply because they include KServe in their offerings.</p>
<h2><b>Serving the Open-Source Community</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA has a long track record on the KServe project. As noted in a <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/03/15/empower-conversational-ai-scale-kserve?extIdCarryOver=true&amp;sc_cid=701f2000001OH6fAAG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent technical blog</a>, KServe’s Open Inference Protocol is used in <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/triton-inference-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a>, which helps users run many AI models simultaneously across many GPUs, frameworks and operating modes.</p>
<p>With KServe, NVIDIA focuses on use cases that involve running one AI model at a time across many GPUs.</p>
<p>As part of the NIM integration, NVIDIA plans to be an active contributor to KServe, building on its portfolio of contributions to open-source software that includes Triton and <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TensorRT-LLM</a>. NVIDIA is also an active member of the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>, which supports open-source code for generative AI and other projects.</p>
<p>Try the NIM API on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA API Catalog</a> using the <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/meta/llama3-8b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Llama 3 8B</a> or <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/meta/llama3-70b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Llama 3 70B</a> LLM models today. Hundreds of NVIDIA partners worldwide are using NIM to deploy generative AI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Taiwan’s leading consumer electronics giants are making advances with AI automation for manufacturing, as fleets of robots and millions of cameras and sensors drive efficiencies across the smart factories of the future.</p>
<p>Dozens of electronics manufacturing and automation specialists — including Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron — are showcasing their use of the NVIDIA software at COMPUTEX, in Taipei, and are called out in NVIDIA founder and CEO <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/computex/">Jensen Huang’s keynote address</a>.</p>
<p>Companies displayed the latest in computer vision and generative AI using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/intelligent-video-analytics-platform/">NVIDIA Metropolis</a> for everything from automating product manufacturing to improving worker safety and device performance.</p>
<h2><b>Creating Factory Autonomy</b></h2>
<p>With increasing production challenges, manufacturers are seeing a need to turn factories into autonomous machines, with generative AI and digital twins as a foundation. AI agents — driven by large language models (LLMs) — are being built that can talk and assist on warehouse floors to boost productivity and increase safety. And digital twins are helping manufacturers simulate and develop factories and AI-powered automation before being deployed in real factories.</p>
<p>Foxconn and its Ingrasys subsidiary use <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> and Metropolis to build digital twins for factories, planning efficiency optimizations and worker safety improvement at a number of manufacturing sites. At COMPUTEX, Foxconn is showing how it uses digital twins to plan placements of many video cameras in factories to optimize its data capture for collecting key insights.</p>
<h2><b>Bringing Generative AI to the Factory Floor</b></h2>
<p>Generative AI is creating productivity leaps across industries. Researcher McKinsey forecasts that generative AI will deliver as much as $290 billion in value for the advanced manufacturing industry, while bringing $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy.</p>
<p>At GTC in March, NVIDIA launched <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/">NVIDIA NIM</a>, a set of microservices designed to speed up generative AI deployment in enterprises. Supporting a wide range of AI models, it ensures seamless, scalable AI inferencing, on premises or in the cloud, using industry-standard application programming interfaces.</p>
<p>Billions of IoT devices worldwide can tap into Metropolis and NVIDIA NIM for improvements in AI perception to enhance their capabilities.</p>
<h2><b>Advancing Manufacturing With NVIDIA NIM</b></h2>
<p>Linker Vision, an AI vision insights specialist, is adopting NVIDIA NIM to assist factories in deploying AI agents that can respond to natural language queries.</p>
<p>The Taipei company uses <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/solutions/robotics-and-edge-computing/vision-ai/visual-insight-agent/">NVIDIA Visual Insight Agent</a> (VIA) in manufacturing environments for always-on video feed monitoring of factory floors. With user prompts, these ChatGPT-like systems can enable operators to ask for video of factory floors to be monitored for insights and safety alerts, like when workers are not wearing hardhats.</p>
<p>Operators can ask questions and receive instant, context-aware responses from AI agents, which can tap into organizational knowledge via <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/ai-workflows/generative-ai-chatbots/">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, an integration of AI that can enhance operational efficiency.</p>
<p>Leading manufacturer Pegatron has factories that span more than 20 million square feet and the facilities process and build more than 15 million assemblies per month, while deploying more than 3,500 robots across factory floors. It has announced efforts based on NVIDIA NIM and is using <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimize-processes-for-large-spaces-with-a-multi-camera-tracking-workflow/">Metropolis multi-camera tracking reference workflows</a> to help with worker safety and productivity on factory lines. Pegatron’s workflow fuses digital twins in Omniverse and Metropolis real-time AI to better monitor and optimize operations.</p>
<h2><b>Boosting Automated Visual Inspections</b></h2>
<p>Adoption of NVIDIA Metropolis is helping Taiwan’s largest electronics manufacturers streamline operations and reduce cost as they build and inspect some of the world’s most complex and high-volume products.</p>
<p>Quality control with manual inspections in manufacturing is a multitrillion-dollar challenge. While automated optical inspection systems have been relied upon for some time, legacy AOI systems have high false detection rates, requiring costly secondary manual inspections for verification.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/metropolis-for-factories">NVIDIA Metropolis for Factories</a> offers a state-of-the-art AI reference workflow for bringing sophisticated and accurate AOI inspection applications to production faster.</p>
<p>TRI, Taiwan’s leading AOI equipment maker, has announced it&#8217;s integrating NVIDIA Metropolis for Factories workflow and capabilities into its latest AOI systems and is also planning to use NVIDIA NIM to further optimize system performance.</p>
<p>Wistron is expanding its <a href="https://youtu.be/XlJMZ1rqSco">OneAI platform</a> for visual inspection and AOI with Metropolis. OneAI has been deployed in more than 10 Wistron factories globally, spanning hundreds of inspection points.</p>
<p>MediaTek, a leading innovator in connectivity and multimedia, and one of Taiwan’s largest IoT silicon vendors, <a href="https://corp.mediatek.com/news-events/press-releases/mediatek-integrates-nvidia-tao-toolkit-with-neuropilot-sdk-for-accelerated-development-of-edge-ai-applications-in-iot">announced</a> at COMPUTEX that it’s teaming with NVIDIA to integrate NVIDIA TAO training and pretrained models into its AI development workflow for IoT device customers. The collaboration brings Metropolis and the latest advances in AI and visual perception to billions of IoT far-edge devices and streamlines software development for MediaTek’s next phase of growth in edge IoT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Foxconn operates more than 170 factories around the world — the latest one a virtual plant pushing the state of the art in industrial automation.</p>
<p>It’s the digital twin of a new factory in Guadalajara, hub of Mexico’s electronics industry. Foxconn’s engineers are defining processes and training robots in this virtual environment, so the physical plant can produce at high efficiency the next engine of accelerated computing, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/hgx/">NVIDIA Blackwell HGX systems</a>.</p>
<p>To design an optimal assembly line, factory engineers need to find the best placement for dozens of robotic arms, each weighing hundreds of pounds. To accurately monitor the overall process, they situate thousands of sensors, including many networked video cameras in a matrix to show plant operators all the right details.</p>
<h2><b>Virtual Factories Create Real Savings</b></h2>
<p>Such challenges are why companies like Foxconn are increasingly creating <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/virtual-factories-industrial-digitalization/">virtual factories</a> for simulation and testing.</p>
<p>“Our digital twin will guide us to new levels of automation and industrial efficiency, saving time, cost and energy,” said Young Liu, chairman of the company that last year had revenues of nearly $200 billion.</p>
<p>Based on its efforts so far, the company anticipates that it can increase the manufacturing efficiency of complex servers using the simulated plant, leading to significant cost savings and reducing kilowatt-hour usage by over 30% annually.</p>
<h2><b>Foxconn Teams With NVIDIA, Siemens</b></h2>
<p>Foxconn is building its digital twin with software from the Siemens Xcelerator portfolio including Teamcenter and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a platform for developing 3D workflows and applications based on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">OpenUSD</a>.</p>
<p>NVIDIA and Siemens <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/siemens-immersive-visualization-generative-ai/">announced</a> in March that they will connect Siemens Xcelerator applications to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/cloud/">NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud</a> API microservices. Foxconn will be among the first to employ the combined services, so its digital twin is physically accurate and visually realistic.</p>
<p>Engineers will employ Teamcenter with Omniverse APIs to design robot work cells and assembly lines. Then they’ll use Omniverse to pull all the 3D CAD elements into one virtual factory where their robots will be trained with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim">NVIDIA Isaac Sim</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Robots Attend a Virtual School</b></h2>
<p>A growing set of manufacturers is building digital twins to streamline factory processes. Foxconn is among the first to take the next step in automation — training their AI robots in the digital twin.</p>
<p>Inside the Foxconn virtual factory, robot arms from manufacturers such as Epson can learn how to see, grasp and move objects with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/manipulator">NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator</a>, a collection of NVIDIA-accelerated libraries and AI foundation models for robot arms.</p>
<p>For example, the robot arms may learn how to pick up a Blackwell server and place it on an <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/isaac-amr-nova-orin-autonomous-mobile-robots/">autonomous mobile robot</a> (AMR). The arms can use Isaac Manipulator&#8217;s cuMotion to find inspection paths for products, even when objects are placed in the way.</p>
<p>Foxconn’s AMRs, from Taiwan’s FARobot, will learn how to see and navigate the factory floor using <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/perceptor">NVIDIA Perceptor</a>, software that helps them build a real-time 3D map that indicates any obstacles. The robot’s routes are generated and optimized by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/cuopt/">NVIDIA cuOpt</a>, a world-record holding route optimization microservice.</p>
<p>Unlike many transport robots that need to stick to carefully drawn lines on the factory floor, these smart AMRs will navigate around obstacles to get wherever they need to go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Taiwan’s leading medical centers — the National Health Research Institute (NHRI) and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) — are set to advance biomedical research and healthcare for patients.</p>
<p>The centers are embracing accelerated computing and generative AI for everything from imaging to enhancing patient care, from streamlining clinical workflows to drug discovery research.</p>
<p>“The use of AI in healthcare will fundamentally change the way we approach disease prevention and treatment,” said Dr. Hung-Yi Chiou, director of the Institute of Population Health Sciences (IPHS) at NHRI. “With AI’s ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, we can develop personalized medicine strategies and early intervention methods that were previously unattainable.”</p>
<p>“The future of AI in healthcare is incredibly promising,” said Dr. Wen-Jin Cherng at CGMH.</p>
<p>With the assistance of AI in smart healthcare, future diagnoses will become more accurate, treatment plans will have better predictions and patients will experience faster recovery, Dr. Cherng explained. And in complex analytical processes, AI can enable more efficient and cost-effective decision-making in healthcare, he added.</p>
<p>“The transformative potential of the NVIDIA Blackwell platform allows us to integrate advanced AI capabilities into our medical practices, enhancing patient care and streamlining clinical workflows like never before,” he said.</p>
<p>NHRI, the leading medical research institution in Taiwan, plays a crucial role in advancing public health through biomedical research and innovation. The integration of NVIDIA accelerated computing into its IT infrastructure marks a significant leap forward in the realm of AI-driven healthcare.</p>
<p>NHRI’s collaboration with NVIDIA also extends to the development of large language models tailored specifically for Taiwan’s healthcare needs.</p>
<p>“Traditional Chinese medical records and genomic data present unique challenges that require localized solutions,” said Dr. Feng-Chi Chen, deputy director of IPHS at the NHRI.</p>
<p>These challenges include the complexity of language variations and the need for precise genomic interpretations specific to Taiwan’s population, Dr. Chen explained.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA accelerated computing enables us to create these solutions, ensuring that our healthcare system remains at the cutting edge of medical research,” he said.</p>
<p>CGMH, one of the largest healthcare systems in Taiwan, operates a network of 10 hospitals with a combined inpatient capacity of over 11,000 beds. It also serves millions of people in outpatient services. It’s a cornerstone of Taiwan’s healthcare system, which is one of the most advanced in the world.</p>
<p>“With the computational power of Blackwell, we can expand our language model services to all hospitals under our umbrella, enhancing professional support, patient care and streamlining clinical workflows,” said Dr. Chang-Fu Kuo, director of the AI center at CGMH. “It addresses the needs of various medical disciplines and diverse patient populations, enabling healthcare professionals to focus on critical clinical tasks and ultimately improve patient outcomes.”</p>
<h2>NHRI, CGMH Pioneering Medical AI</h2>
<p>NHRI currently uses six <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-platform">NVIDIA DGX A100 systems</a> for cloud and data center services, focusing on biomedical model training and genomic analysis.</p>
<p>By harnessing the power of NVIDIA accelerated computing, NHRI is also tackling pressing public health issues. One of its key projects involves using AI to predict the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions by analyzing a multitude of genetic and environmental parameters.</p>
<p>“This level of analysis was previously unattainable due to computational constraints,” said Dr. Chen. “Now, with the power of NVIDIA accelerated computing, we will be able to offer more accurate risk assessments and preventative strategies.”</p>
<p>CGMH also has a diverse array of NVIDIA hardware, including NVIDIA H100, A100, and other Tensor Core GPUs, which it uses for medical imaging development and deployment. The foundation serves 46 models daily and intends to use Blackwell for LLM training and the deployment of service robots in hospitals.</p>
<p>Running these systems on premises and keeping the data within the hospital’s infrastructure are key to ensuring patient data privacy as well as faster data processing and reduced latency, said Dr. Chihung Lin, deputy director of the CGMH AI center.</p>
<p>These technologies may be used in various medical applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Clinical Decision Support System:</b> Developed on premises to ensure patient data confidentiality and privacy, this system assists clinicians by providing access to up-to-date data and guidelines and using models to answer questions and prepare medical decisions.</li>
<li><b>Patient Interaction System:</b> Allows patients to interact with a robot to get answers about their medication and medical conditions, reducing the burden on medical staff. Medical staff review the robot’s responses to ensure accuracy.</li>
<li><b>Medical Imaging:</b> Enhances radiology and other imaging tasks using AI. This project is one of the most mature AI technologies in CGMH’s healthcare system.</li>
<li><b>Precision Medicine:</b> Handles large-scale genomic data and transforms sequences into readable medical reports for doctors. Focused on building computational facilities to support whole genome and exome sequencing.</li>
<li><b>Expansion of AI Services:</b> Aims to extend the language model services to all hospitals under CGMH’s umbrella, leveraging the computational capacity from the Blackwell platform to support this expansion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other applications include early detection of colorectal cancer via endoscopy, autoimmune disease screening through microscope images and kidney disease prediction using general imaging techniques.</p>
<p>NHRI and CGMH’s adoption of accelerated computing underscores the growing importance of AI and advanced computing in medical research and healthcare delivery.</p>
<p>With these tools, Taiwan is poised to make strides in improving patient outcomes and advancing biomedical science.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>Weather forecasters in Taiwan had their hair blown back when they saw a typhoon up close, created on a computer that slashed the time and energy needed for the job.</p>
<p>It’s a reaction that users in many fields are feeling as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> shows them how new levels of performance contribute to reductions in total cost of ownership.</p>
<h2><b>Inside the AI of the Storm</b></h2>
<p>Tracking a typhoon provided a great test case of generative AI’s prowess. The work traditionally begins with clusters of CPUs cranking on complex algorithms to create atmospheric models with a 25-kilometer resolution.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15214" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CorrDiff</a>, a generative AI model that’s part of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/high-performance-computing/earth-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Earth-2</a>, a set of services and software for weather and climate research.</p>
<p>Using a class of diffusion models that power today’s text-to-image services, CorrDiff resolved the <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-solution-brief-weather-prediction">25-km models to two kilometers 1,000x faster, using 3<b>,</b>000x less energy</a> for a single inference than traditional methods.</p>
<h2><b>CorrDiff Cuts Costs 50x, Energy Use 25x</b></h2>
<p>CorrDiff shines on the NVIDIA AI platform, even when retraining the model once a year and using statistical groups of a thousand forecasts to boost the accuracy of predictions. Compared to traditional methods under these conditions, it slashes cost by 50x cost and energy use by 25x a year.</p>
<p>That means work that used to require nearly $3 million for a cluster of CPUs and the energy to run them can be done for about $60,000 on a single system with an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU</a>. It’s a massive reduction that shows how generative AI and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accelerated computing</a> increases energy efficiency and lowers total cost of ownership.</p>
<p>The technology also helps forecasters see more precisely where a typhoon will land, potentially saving lives.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA’s CorrDiff generative AI model opens the door to the use of AI-generated kilometer-scale weather forecasts, enabling Taiwan to prepare better for typhoons,” said Hongey Chen, a director of Taiwan’s National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction.</p>
<p>The Taiwan forecasters could save nearly a gigawatt-hour a year, using CorrDiff. Energy savings could balloon if the nearly 200 regional weather data centers around the world adopt the technology for more <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/sustainable-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainable computing</a>.</p>
<p>Companies that sell commercial forecasts are <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-science-isc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also adopting CorrDiff</a>, attracted by its speed and savings.</p>
<h2><b>Broad Horizons for Energy Efficiency</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA Earth-2 takes these capabilities to a planetary scale. It fuses AI, physics simulations and observed data to help countries and companies respond to global issues like climate change. That will help address the impacts of climate change, which is expected to cost a million lives and $1.7 trillion per year by 2050.</p>
<p>Accelerated computing and generative AI are bringing new levels of performance and energy efficiency to many applications. Explainers on <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-green-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">green computing</a> and why <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/why-gpus-are-great-for-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPUs are great for AI</a> provide more context and some examples.</p>
<p>Compare the costs and energy consumption of popular workloads running on an x86 CPU-based server versus an NVIDIA GPU server with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/sustainable-computing/energy-efficiency-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this simple calculator</a>. And watch Huang’s <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/computex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keynote address</a> at COMPUTEX to get the big picture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"></div><p>After the 2008 financial crisis and increased risk-management regulations that followed, Pierre Spatz anticipated banks would focus on reducing computing expenses.</p>
<p>As head of quantitative research at Murex, a trading and risk management software company based in Paris, Spatz adopted NVIDIA’s CUDA and GPU-accelerated computing, aiming for top performance and energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Always seeking the latest technologies, the company’s quants team has begun trials of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/">NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip</a>. The effort is focused on helping customers better price and manage credit and market risk exposures of derivatives contracts.</p>
<p>More than 60,000 daily users in 65 countries rely on the Murex MX.3 platform. MX.3 assists banks, asset managers, pension funds and other financial institutions with their trading, risk and operations across asset classes.</p>
<h2><b>Managing Risk With MX.3 Driven by Grace Hopper</b></h2>
<p>Financial institutions need high-performance computing infrastructure to run risk models on vast amounts of data for pricing and risk calculations, and to deliver real-time decision-making capabilities.</p>
<p>MX.3 coverage includes both credit and market risk, BASEL capital standards, fundamental review of the trading book and x-valuation adjustment (XVA). XVA is used for different types of valuation adjustments related to derivative contracts, such as the credit value adjustment (CVA), the margin value adjustment and the funding valuation adjustment.</p>
<p>Murex is testing Grace Hopper on the MX.3 platform for XVA calculations, as well as for market risk calibration, pricing evaluation, sensitivity, and profit and loss calculations on various asset classes.</p>
<p>Grace Hopper offers faster calculation as well as power savings to the Murex platform.</p>
<p>“On counterparty credit risk workloads such as CVA, Grace Hopper is the perfect fit, leveraging a heterogeneous architecture with a unique mix of CPU and GPU computations,” Spatz said. “On risk calculations, Grace is not only the fastest processor, but also far more power-efficient, making green IT a reality in the trading world.”</p>
<p>When running XVA workloads in MX.3, the Murex research and development lab has noticed Grace Hopper can offer a 4x reduction in energy consumption and a 7x performance improvement compared with CPU-based systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-1-002.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-71879" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-1-002-400x270.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="270" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-1-002-400x270.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-1-002-672x454.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-1-002-768x519.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-1-002-666x450.jpg 666w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-1-002-318x215.jpg 318w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-1-002-148x100.jpg 148w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-1-002.jpg 1027w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Pricing FX Barrier Options in MX.3 With Grace Hopper </b></h2>
<p>To price foreign exchange (FX) barrier options, Murex has used its flagship and latest stochastic local volatility model and also noticed impressive performance improvements when running on Grace Hopper. A barrier option is a derivative with a payoff that relies on whether its underlying asset price reaches or crosses a specified threshold during the span of the option contract.</p>
<p>The pricing evaluation is done with a 2D partial differential equation, which is more cost-effective on the Arm-based NVIDIA Grace CPU in GH200. Pricing this derivative with MX.3 on Grace Hopper goes 2.3x faster compared with Intel Xeon Gold 6148.</p>

<p>The NVIDIA Grace CPU also offers significant power efficiencies for FX barrier calculations on a watts-per-server basis, and it’s 5x better.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-3-002.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-71887" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-3-002-400x267.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-3-002-400x267.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-3-002-672x448.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-3-002-675x450.jpg 675w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-3-002-322x215.jpg 322w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-3-002-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Murex-Blog_Figure-3-002.jpg 760w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>NVIDIA’s next-generation accelerated computing platform is driving energy efficiency and cost-saving for high-performance computing for quantitative analytics in capital markets, says Murex, pointing to the results above.</p>
