NVIDIA’s automotive partners are using digitalization to transform every phase of the product lifecycle — evolving primarily physical, manual processes into software-driven, AI-enhanced digital systems.</p>
<p>Watch the video to learn more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Digitalization: A Game Changer for the Auto Industry" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2J-o0tO7-98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Digitalization: A Game Changer From End to End</b></h2>
<p>Kaivan Karimi, global partner strategy lead at Microsoft, observes that companies are achieving “huge” results from “digitizing the physical entity, running simulations and rendering in 3D, whether it’s factory automation or modernizing the design and development of the car.”</p>
<p>Brian Ullem, vice president of engineering at Capgemini, explains that, with “the 30,000 parts that go into a car, it takes approximately five years to develop a vehicle end to end. Instead of building 50 or 100 cars, we can use digitalization to simulate without having to build prototypes. That saves a lot of time and money in the process.”</p>
<p>Thomas Mueller, chief technology officer of engineering at Wipro, adds that with digitalization, “we are now able to run simulations at a low cost…and improve the user experience.”</p>
<h2><b>Simulation: Critical for Autonomous Driving</b></h2>
<p>“Simulation is crucial to the development of autonomous systems,” says Ziv Binyamini, CEO of Foretellix. “On one hand, you need the real world, but this is highly costly. So you have to complement it with the ability to simulate a virtual world where everything is possible. And then you can, in a very cost-effective way, iterate quickly and ensure the system operates under all of these conditions.”</p>
<p>Simulation “gives our customers the power to validate their ADAS or autonomous systems virtually — with highly accurate sensors in the camera, lidar and radar domains — without having to rely on actual physical drives,” adds Tony Karam, global sales director at Ansys.</p>
<p>Austin Russell, founder and CEO of Luminar, agrees that &#8220;simulation is absolutely critical for autonomous driving. It’s great to see the work that NVIDIA has been doing in that domain, with not just the hardware but also the software.”</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA Omniverse: The Digital-Physical Convergence</b></h2>
<p>“Software is a new component in the value proposition,” notes Walid Negm, chief technology officer of product engineering at Deloitte. The companies that will “survive and thrive are going to have to become much more efficient using the digital-physical convergence. The Omniverse experience is going to be important for the automotive sector.”</p>
<p>Shiv Tasker, global vice president of engineering at Capgemini, adds that the “visualization and production of digital twins relies on an efficient, high-performance infrastructure as well as the platforms that make it easy for customers to adopt the technology.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">Omniverse</a> “will allow your worldwide team to simultaneously collaborate,” says Karimi of Microsoft. “Design engineers, migration engineers, test engineers — everybody collaborates simultaneously. That’s the power of NVIDIA Omniverse.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Thanks to their work driving AI forward, Akshit Arora and Rafael Valle could someday speak to their spouses’ families in their native languages.</p>
<p>Arora and Valle — along with colleagues Sungwon Kim and Rohan Badlani — won the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/limmits24/home">LIMMITS ’24 challenge</a> which asks contestants to recreate in real time a speaker’s voice in English or any of six languages spoken in India with the appropriate accent. Their novel AI model only required a three-second speech sample.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA team advanced the state of the art in an emerging field of personalized voice interfaces for more than a billion native speakers of Bengali, Chhattisgarhi, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi and Telugu.</p>
<h2><b>Making Voice Interfaces Realistic</b></h2>
<p>The technology for personalized text-to-speech translation is a work in progress. Existing services sometimes fail to accurately reflect the accents of the target language or nuances of the speaker’s voice.</p>
<p>The challenge judged entries by listening for the naturalness of models’ resulting speech and its similarity to the original speaker’s voice.</p>
<p>The latest improvements promise personalized, realistic conversations and experiences that break language barriers. Broadcasters, telcos, universities, as well as e-commerce and online gaming services are eager to deploy such technology to create multilingual movies, lectures and virtual agents.</p>
<p>“We demonstrated we can do this at a scale not previously seen,” said Arora, who has two uses close to his heart.</p>
<h2><b>Breaking Down Linguistic Barriers</b></h2>
<p>A senior data scientist who supports one of NVIDIA’s biggest customers, Arora speaks Punjabi, while his wife and her family are native Tamil speakers.</p>
<p>It’s a gulf he’s long wanted to bridge for himself and others. “I had classmates who knew their native languages much better than the Hindi and English used in school, so they struggled to understand class material,” he said.</p>
<p>The gulf crosses continents for Valle, a native of Brazil whose wife and family speak Gujarati, a language popular in west India.</p>
<p>“It’s a problem I face every day,” said Valle, an AI researcher with degrees in computer music and machine listening and improvisation. “We’ve tried many products to help us have clearer conversations.”</p>
<p>Badlani, an AI researcher, said living in seven different Indian states, each with its own popular language, inspired him to work in the field.</p>
<h2><b>A Race to the Finish Line</b></h2>
<p>The initiative started nearly two years ago when Arora and Badlani formed the four-person team to work on the very different version of the challenge that would be held in 2023.</p>
<p>Their efforts generated a working code base for the so-called Indic languages. But getting to the win announced in January required a full-on sprint because the 2024 challenge didn’t get on the team’s radar until 15 days before the deadline.</p>
<p>Luckily, Kim, a deep learning researcher in NVIDIA’s Seoul office, had been working for some time on an AI model well suited to the challenge.</p>
<p>A specialist in text-to-speech voice synthesis, Kim was designing a so-called P-Flow model prior to starting his second internship at NVIDIA in 2023. P-Flow models borrow the technique large language models employ of using short voice samples as prompts so they can respond to new inputs without retraining.</p>
<p>“I created the model for English, but we were able to generalize it for any language,” he said.</p>
<p>“We were talking and texting about this model even before he started at NVIDIA,” said Valle, who mentored Kim in two internships before he joined full time in January.</p>
<h2><b>Giving Others a Voice</b></h2>
<p>P-Flow will soon be part of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/riva/">NVIDIA Riva</a>, a framework for building multilingual speech and translation AI software, included in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform.</p>
<p>The new capability will let users deploy the technology inside their data centers, on personal systems or in public or private cloud services. Today, voice translation services typically run on public cloud services.</p>
<p>“I hope our customers are inspired to try this technology,” Arora said. “I enjoy being able to showcase in challenges like this one the work we do every day.”</p>
<p>The contest is part of <a href="https://syspin.iisc.ac.in/">an initiative</a> to develop open-source datasets and AI models for nine languages most widely spoken in India.</p>
<p>Hear Arora and Badlani share their experiences in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/session-catalog/?tab.allsessions=1700692987788001F1cG&amp;search=S62517#/session/1696286805576001jEsz">a session</a> at GTC next month.</p>
<p>And listen to the results of the team’s model below, starting with a <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/SYSPIN/LIMMITS24_target_speaker_fewshot_samples">three-second sample</a> of a native Kannada speaker:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Chatbots are used by millions of people around the world every day, powered by NVIDIA GPU-based cloud servers. Now, these groundbreaking tools are coming to Windows PCs powered by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a> for local, fast, custom <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chat-with-rtx-generative-ai/">Chat with RTX</a>, now free to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chat-with-rtx-generative-ai/">download</a>, is a tech demo that lets users personalize a chatbot with their own content, accelerated by a local <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU</a> or higher with at least 8GB of video random access memory, or VRAM.</p>
<h2><b>Ask Me Anything</b></h2>
<p>Chat with RTX uses <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a> (RAG), NVIDIA <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ignite-rtx-ai-tensorrt-llm-chat-api/">TensorRT-LLM</a> software and NVIDIA RTX acceleration to bring generative AI capabilities to local, GeForce-powered Windows PCs. Users can quickly, easily connect local files on a PC as a dataset to an open-source <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/">large language model</a> like Mistral or Llama 2, enabling queries for quick, contextually relevant answers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Create A Personalized AI Chatbot with Chat With RTX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gdsRJZT3IJw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Rather than searching through notes or saved content, users can simply type queries. For example, one could ask, “What was the restaurant my partner recommended while in Las Vegas?” and Chat with RTX will scan local files the user points it to and provide the answer with context.</p>
<p>The tool supports various file formats, including .txt, .pdf, .doc/.docx and .xml. Point the application at the folder containing these files, and the tool will load them into its library in just seconds.</p>
<p>Users can also include information from YouTube videos and playlists. Adding a video URL to Chat with RTX allows users to integrate this knowledge into their chatbot for contextual queries. For example, ask for travel recommendations based on content from favorite influencer videos, or get quick tutorials and how-tos based on top educational resources.</p>

<p>Since Chat with RTX runs locally on Windows RTX PCs and workstations, the provided results are fast — and the user’s data stays on the device. Rather than relying on cloud-based LLM services, Chat with RTX lets users process sensitive data on a local PC without the need to share it with a third party or have an internet connection.</p>
<p>In addition to a GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU or higher with a minimum 8GB of VRAM, Chat with RTX requires Windows 10 or 11, and the latest NVIDIA GPU drivers.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: We have identified an issue in Chat with RTX that causes installation to fail when the user selects a different installation directory. This will be fixed in a future release. For the time being, users should use the default installation directory (&#8220;C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\NVIDIA\ChatWithRTX&#8221;).</em></p>
<h2><b>Develop LLM-Based Applications With RTX</b></h2>
<p>Chat with RTX shows the potential of accelerating LLMs with RTX GPUs. The app is built from the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/trt-llm-rag-windows">TensorRT-LLM RAG developer reference project, available on GitHub</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Every country needs to own the production of their own intelligence, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang told attendees Monday at the World Governments Summit in Dubai.</p>
<p>Huang, who spoke as part of a fireside chat with the UAE’s Minister of AI, His Excellency Omar Al Olama, described sovereign AI — which emphasizes a country’s ownership over its data and the intelligence it produces — as an enormous opportunity for the world’s leaders.</p>
<p>“It codifies your culture, your society’s intelligence, your common sense, your history – you own your own data,” Huang told Al Olama during their conversation, a highlight of an event attended by more than 4,000 delegates from 150 countries.</p>
<p>“We completely subscribe to that vision,” Al Olama said. “That’s why the UAE is moving aggressively on creating large language models and mobilizing compute.”</p>
<p>Huang’s appearance in the UAE comes as the Gulf State is moving rapidly to transform itself from an energy powerhouse into a global information technology hub.</p>
<p>Dubai is the latest stop for Huang in a global tour that has included meetings with leaders in Canada, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam over the past six months.<br />
<b><br />
</b>The Middle East is poised to reap significant benefits from AI, with PwC projecting a $320 billion boost to the region’s economy by 2030.</p>
<p>At Monday’s summit, Huang urged leaders not to be “mystified” by AI. AI’s unprecedented ability to take directions from ordinary humans makes it critical for countries to embrace AI, infusing it with local languages and expertise.</p>
<p>In response to Al Olama’s question about how he might approach AI if he were the leader of a developing nation, Huang emphasized the importance of building infrastructure.</p>
<p>“It’s not that costly, it is also not that hard,” Huang said. “The first thing that I would do, of course, is I would codify the language, the data of your culture into your own large language model.”</p>
<p>And as AI and accelerated computing has developed, NVIDIA GPUs have become a platform for one innovation after another.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA GPU is the only platform that’s available to everybody on any platform,” Huang said. “This ubiquity has not only democratized AI but facilitated a wave of innovation that spans from cloud computing to autonomous systems and beyond.</p>
<p>All of this promises to unleash new kinds of innovations that go beyond what’s traditionally been thought of as information technology.</p>
<p>Huang even countered advice offered by many visionaries over the years who urged young people to study computer science in order to compete in the information age. No longer.</p>
<p>“In fact, it’s almost exactly the opposite,” Huang said. “It is our job to create computing technologies that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human: everybody in the world is now a programmer — that is the miracle.”</p>
<p>In a move that further underscores the regional momentum behind AI, Moro Hub, a subsidiary of Digital DEWA, the digital arm of the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, focused on providing cloud services, cybersecurity and smart city solutions, announced Monday it has agreed to build a green data center with NVIDIA.</p>
<p>In addition to the fireside chat, the summit featured panels on smart mobility, sustainable development and more, showcasing the latest in AI advancements. Later in the evening, Huang and Al Olama took the stage at the ‘Get Inspired’ ecosystem event, organized by the UAE’s AI Office, featuring 280 attendees including developers, start-ups, and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>With advances in computing, sophisticated AI models and machine learning are having a profound impact on business and society. Industries can use AI to quickly analyze vast bodies of data, allowing them to derive meaningful insights, make predictions and automate processes for greater efficiency.</p>
<p>In the public sector, government agencies are achieving superior disaster preparedness. Biomedical researchers are bringing novel drugs to market faster. Telecommunications providers are building more energy-efficient networks. Manufacturers are trimming emissions from product design, development and manufacturing processes. Hollywood studios are creating impressive visual effects at a fraction of the cost and time. Robots are being deployed on important missions to help preserve the Earth. And investment advisors are running more trade scenarios to optimize portfolios.</p>
<p><a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-10-Data-Suggests-Growth-in-Enterprise-Adoption-of-AI-is-Due-to-Widespread-Deployment-by-Early-Adopters#:~:text=Today%2C%C2%A042%25%C2%A0of%20IT%20professionals%20at%20large%20organizations%20report%20that%20they%20have%20actively%20deployed%20AI%20while%20an%20additional%C2%A040%25%C2%A0are%20actively%20exploring%20using%20the%20technology.%C2%A0">Eighty-two percent</a> of companies surveyed are already using or exploring AI, and <a href="https://www.wavestone.us/insights/data-and-analytics-leadership-annual-executive-survey-2023/">84%</a> report that they’re increasing investments in data and AI initiatives. Any organization that delays AI implementation risks missing out on new efficiency gains and becoming obsolete.</p>
<p>However, AI workloads are computationally demanding, and legacy computing systems are ill-equipped for the development and deployment of AI. CPU-based compute requires linear growth in power input to meet the increased processing needs of AI and data-heavy workloads. If data centers are using carbon-based energy, it’s impossible for enterprises to innovate using AI while controlling greenhouse gas emissions and meeting sustainability commitments. Plus, many countries are introducing tougher regulations to enforce data center carbon reporting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/solutions/accelerated-computing/?ncid=so-link-420754-vt21">Accelerated computing</a> — the use of GPUs and special hardware, software and parallel computing techniques — has exponentially improved the performance and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/energy-efficiency/?ncid=so-link-787991">energy efficiency</a> of data centers.</p>
<p>Below, read more on how industries are using energy-efficient computing to scale AI, improve products and services, and reduce emissions and operational costs.</p>
<h2><strong>The Public Sector Drives Research, Delivers Improved Citizen Services </strong></h2>
<p>Data is playing an increasingly important role in government services, including for public health and disease surveillance, scientific research, social security administration, and extreme-weather monitoring and management. These operations require platforms and systems that can handle large volumes of data, provide real-time data access, and ensure data quality and accuracy.</p>
<p>But many government agencies rely on legacy systems that are difficult to maintain, don&#8217;t efficiently integrate with modern technologies and consume excessive energy. To handle increasingly demanding workloads while sticking to sustainability goals, government agencies and public organizations must adopt more efficient computing solutions.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy is making inroads in this endeavor. The department runs the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center for open science. NERSC develops simulations, data analytics and machine learning solutions to accelerate scientific discovery through computation. Seeking new computing efficiencies, the center measured results across four of its key high performance computing and AI applications. It clocked how fast the applications ran, as well as how much energy they consumed using CPU-only versus GPU-accelerated nodes on <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nersc-perlmutter-ai-supercomputer/">Perlmutter</a>, one of the world’s largest supercomputers.</p>
<p>At performance parity, a GPU-accelerated cluster consumes <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-energy-efficiency/gpu-energy-efficiency">588 less megawatt hours per month</a>, representing a 5x improvement in energy efficiency. By running the same workload on GPUs rather than CPU-only instances, researchers could save millions of dollars per month. These gains mean that the 8,000+ researchers using NERSC computing infrastructure can perform more experiments on important use cases, like studying subatomic interactions to uncover new green energy sources, developing 3D maps of the universe and bolstering a broad range of innovations in materials science and quantum physics.</p>
<p>Governments help protect citizens from adverse weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, blizzards and heat waves. With GPU deployments, climate models, like the IFS model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, can run up <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-energy-efficiency/faster-weather-prediction">to 24x faster</a> while reducing annual energy usage by up to 127 gigawatt hours compared to CPU-only systems. As extreme-weather events occur with greater frequency and, often, with little warning, meteorology centers can use accelerated computing to generate more accurate, timely forecasts that improve readiness and response.</p>
<p>By adopting more efficient computing systems, governments can save costs while equipping researchers with the tools they need for scientific discoveries to improve climate modeling and forecasting, as well as deliver superior services in public health, disaster relief and more.</p>
<h2><strong>Drug Discovery Researchers Conduct Virtual Screenings, Generate New Proteins at Light Speed</strong></h2>
<p>Drug development has always been a time-consuming process that involves innumerable calculations and thousands of experiments to screen new compounds. To develop novel medications, the binding properties of small molecules must be tested against protein targets, a cumbersome task required for up to billions of compounds — which translates to billions of CPU hours and hundreds of millions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>Highly accurate AI models can now predict protein structures, generate small molecules, predict protein-ligand binding and perform virtual screening.</p>
<p>Researchers at <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/covid-autodock-summit-ornl/">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> (ORNL) and Scripps Research have shown that screening a dataset of billions of compounds against a protein, which has traditionally taken years, can now be completed in just hours with accelerated computing. By running <a href="https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/hpc:autodock">AutoDock</a>, a molecular-modeling simulation software, on a supercomputer with more than 27,000 NVIDIA GPUs, ORNL screened more than 25,000 molecules per second and evaluated the docking of 1 billion compounds in less than 12 hours. This is a speedup of more than 50x compared with running AutoDock on CPUs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.iambic.ai/">Iambic</a>, an AI platform for drug discovery, has developed an approach combining quantum chemistry and AI that calculates quantum-accurate molecular-binding energies and forces at a fraction of the computational expense of traditional methods. These energies and forces can power molecular-dynamics simulations at unprecedented speed and accuracy. With its OrbNet model, Iambic uses a graph <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-transformer-model/">transformer</a> to power quantum-mechanical operators that represent chemical structures. The company is using the technology to identify drug molecules that could deactivate proteins linked to certain cancer types.</p>
<p>As the number of new drug approvals declines and research and development and computing costs rise, optimizing drug discovery with accelerated computing can help control energy expenditures while creating a far-reaching impact on medical research, treatments and patient outcomes.</p>
<h2><strong>Telcos Scale Network Capacity</strong></h2>
<p>To connect their subscribers, telecommunications companies send data across sprawling networks of cell towers, fiber-optic cables and wireless signals. In the U.S., AT&amp;T’s network connects more than 100 million users from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska to the Florida Keys, processing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcfall22-a41235/">500 petabytes of data per day</a>. As telcos add compute-intensive workloads like AI and user plane function (UPF) to process and route data over 5G networks, power consumption costs are skyrocketing.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T processes trillions of data rows to support field technician dispatch operations, generate performance reports and power mobile connectivity. To process data faster, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/att-data-science-rapids/">AT&amp;T tested the NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark</a>. By spreading work across nodes in a cluster, the software processed 2.8 trillion rows of information — a month’s worth of mobile data — in just five hours. That’s 3.3x faster at 60% lower cost than any prior test.</p>
<p>Other telcos are saving energy by offloading networking and security tasks to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-smartnic/">SmartNICs</a> and data processing units (<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/whats-a-dpu-data-processing-unit/">DPUs</a>) to reduce server power consumption. Ericsson, a leading telecommunications equipment manufacturer, tested a 5G UPF on servers with and without network offload to an <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-accelerated-networking-resource-library-ms/en-us-accelerated-networking-resource-library/nvidia-dpu-power-eff">NVIDIA ConnectX-6 Dx NIC</a>. At maximum network traffic, the network offloading provided 23% power savings. The study also found that CPU micro-sleeps and frequency scaling — allowing CPUs to sleep and slow their clock frequencies during low workload levels — saved more than 10% of power per CPU.</p>
<p>Hardware-accelerated networking offloads like these allow telco operators to increase network capacity without a proportional increase in energy consumption, ensuring that networks can scale to handle increased demand and conserve energy during times of low use. By adopting energy-efficient accelerated computing, telco operators can reduce their carbon footprint, improve scalability and lower operational costs.</p>
<h2><strong>Manufacturing and Product Design Teams Achieve Faster, Cleaner Simulations</strong></h2>
<p>Many industries rely on computational fluid dynamics during design and engineering processes to model fluid flows, combustion, heat transfer and aeroacoustics. The aerospace and automotive industries use CFD to model vehicle aerodynamics, and the energy and environmental industries use it to optimize fluid-particle refining systems and model reactions, wind-farm air flow and hydro-plant water flow.</p>
<p>Traditional CFD methods are compute-intensive, using nearly 25 billion CPU core hours annually, and consume massive amounts of energy. This is a major obstacle for industrial companies looking to reduce carbon emissions and achieve net zero. Parallel computing with GPUs is making a difference.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ansys.com/blog/unleashing-the-full-power-of-gpus-for-ansys-fluent">Ansys, an engineering simulation company, is speeding up CFD physics models</a> with GPUs to help customers drastically reduce emissions while improving the aerodynamics of vehicles. To measure computing efficiency, the company ran the benchmark DrivAer model, used for optimizing vehicle geometry, on different CPU and GPU configurations using its Fluent fluid-simulation software. Results showed that a single GPU achieved more than 5x greater performance than a cluster with 80 CPU cores. With eight GPUs, the simulation experienced more than a 30x speedup. And a server with six GPUs reduced power consumption 4x compared with a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/high-performance-computing/">high performance computing</a> CPU cluster delivering the same performance.</p>
<p>CPFD offers <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-isv-energy-industry/energy-solution-show-1">GPU parallelization for Barracuda Virtual Reactor</a>, a physics-based engineering software package capable of predicting fluid, particulate-solid, thermal and chemically reacting behavior in fluidized bed reactors and other fluid-particle systems.</p>
<p>Using CPFD’s Barracuda software, green energy supplier ThermoChem Recovery International (TRI) developed technology that converts municipal solid waste and woody biomass into jet fuel. Since its partnership with CPFD began 14 years ago, TRI has benefitted from 1,500x model speedups as CPFD moved its code from CPU hardware to full GPU parallelization. With these exponential speedups, models that would’ve previously taken years to run can now be completed in a day or less, saving millions of dollars in data center infrastructure and energy costs.</p>
<p>With GPU parallelization and energy-efficient architectures, industrial design processes that rely on <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-vehicles">CFD can benefit from dramatically faster simulations</a> while achieving significant energy savings.</p>
<h2><strong>Media and Entertainment Boost Rendering</strong></h2>
<p>Rendering visual effects (VFX) and stylized animations consumes nearly 10 billion CPU core hours per year in the media and entertainment industry. A single animated film can require over 50,000 CPU cores working for more than 300 million hours. Enabling this necessitates a large space for data centers, climate control and computing — all of which result in substantial expenditures and a sizable carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Accelerated computing offers a more energy-efficient way to produce VFX and animation, enabling studios to iterate faster and compress production times.</p>
<p>Studios like Wylie Co., known for visuals in the Oscar-winning film <i>Dune</i> and in HBO and Netflix features, are adopting GPU-powered rendering to improve performance and save energy. After migrating to GPU rendering, <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-energy-efficiency/wylie-co-gpu-renderi">Wylie Co. realized a 24x performance</a> boost over CPUs.</p>
<p>Image Engine, a VFX company involved in creating Marvel Entertainment movies and <i>Star Wars</i>-based television shows, observed a 25x performance improvement by using GPUs for rendering.</p>
<p>GPUs can increase performance up to 46x while <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-so-1">reducing energy consumption by 10x</a> and capital expenses by 6x. With accelerated computing, the media and entertainment industry has the potential to save a staggering $900 million in hardware acquisition costs worldwide and conserve 215 gigawatt hours of energy that would have been consumed by CPU-based render farms. Such a shift would lead to substantial cost savings and significant reductions in the industry’s environmental impact.</p>
<h2><strong>Robotics Developers Extend Battery Life for Important Missions </strong></h2>
<p>With <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-edge-computing/">edge</a> AI and supercomputing now available using compact modules, demand for robots is surging for use in factory logistics, sales showrooms, urban delivery services and even ocean exploration. Mobile robot shipments are expected to climb from 549,000 units last year to 3 million by 2030, with revenue forecast to jump from more than $24 billion to $111 billion in the same period, according to <a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/market-research/product/market-data/MD-CIROBO/">ABI Research</a>.</p>
<p>Most robots are battery-operated and rely on an array of lidar sensors and cameras for navigation. Robots communicate with edge servers or clouds for mission dispatch and require high throughput due to diverse sets of camera sensors as well as low latency for real-time decision-making. These factors necessitate energy-efficient onboard computing.</p>
<p>Accelerated edge computing can be optimized to decode images, process video and analyze lidar data to enable robot navigation of unstructured environments. This allows developers to build and deploy more energy-efficient machines that can remain in service for longer without needing to charge.</p>
<p>The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Autonomous Robotics and Perception Laboratory (<a href="https://warp.whoi.edu/">WARPLab</a>) and MIT are using the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson Orin</a> platform for energy-efficient edge AI and robotics to power an autonomous underwater vehicle to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/coral-reef-decline-curee-robot-jetson-isaac-omniverse/">study coral reefs</a>.</p>
<p>The AUV, named CUREE, for Curious Underwater Robot for Ecosystem Exploration, gathers visual, audio and other environmental data to help understand the human impact on reefs and sea life. With 25% of the vehicle’s power needed for data collection, energy efficiency is a must. With Jetson Orin, CUREE constructs 3D models of reefs, tracks marine organisms and plant life, and autonomously navigates and gathers data. The AUV’s onboard energy-efficient computing also powers convolutional neural networks that enhance underwater vision by reducing backscatter and correcting colors. This enables CUREE to transmit clear images to scientists, facilitating fish detection and reef analysis.</p>
<p>Driverless smart tractors with energy-efficient edge computing are now available to help farmers with automation and data analysis. The <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/mondavi-monarch-smart-electric-jetson-tractor/">Founder Series MK-V tractors</a>, designed by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a> member Monarch Tractor, combine electrification, automation and data analysis to help farmers reduce their carbon footprint, improve field safety and streamline farming operations. Using onboard AI video analytics, the tractor can traverse rows of crops, enabling it to navigate even in remote areas without connectivity or GPS.</p>
<p>The MK-V tractor produces zero emissions and is estimated to save farmers $2,600 annually compared to diesel tractors. The tractor’s AI data analysis advises farmers on how to reduce the use of expensive, harmful herbicides that deplete the soil. Decreasing the volume of chemicals is a win all around, empowering farmers to protect the quality of soil, reduce herbicide expenditures and deliver more naturally cultivated produce to consumers.</p>
<p>As energy-efficient edge computing becomes more accessible to enable AI, expect to see growing use cases for mobile robots that can navigate complex environments, make split-second decisions, interact with humans and safely perform difficult tasks with precision.</p>
<h2><strong>Financial Services Use Data to Inform Investment Decisions </strong></h2>
<p>Financial services is an incredibly data-intensive industry. Bankers and asset managers pursuing the best results for investors rely on AI algorithms to churn through terabytes of unstructured data from economic indicators, earnings reports, news articles, and disparate environmental, social and governance metrics to generate market insight that inform investments. Plus, financial services companies must comb through network data and transactions to prevent fraud and protect accounts.</p>
<p>NVIDIA and Dell Technologies are optimizing computing for financial workloads to achieve higher throughput, speed and capacity with greater energy efficiency. The Strategic Technology Analysis Center, an organization dedicated to technology discovery and assessment in the finance industry, recently <a href="https://www.stacresearch.com/news/NVDA231030">tested the STAC-A2 benchmark tests</a> on several computing stacks comprising CPU-only infrastructure and GPU-based infrastructure. The STAC-A2 benchmark is designed by quants and technologists to measure the performance, scalability, quality and resource efficiency of technology stacks running market-risk analysis for derivatives.</p>
<p>When testing the STAC-A2 options pricing benchmark, the Dell PowerEdge server with NVIDIA GPUs performed 16x faster and 3x more energy efficiently than a CPU-only system for the same workload. This enables investment advisors to integrate larger bodies of data into derivatives risk-analysis calculations, enabling more data-driven decisions without increasing computing time or energy requirements.</p>
<p>PayPal, which was looking to deploy a new fraud-detection system to operate 24/7, worldwide and in real time to protect customer transactions, realized CPU-only servers couldn’t meet such computing requirements. Using NVIDIA GPUs for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/inference-platform/">inference</a>, PayPal improved real-time fraud detection by 10% and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/gpu-inference-momentum-continues-to-build/">lowered server energy consumption by nearly 8x</a>.</p>
<p>With accelerated computing, financial services organizations can run more iterations of investment scenarios, improve risk assessments and make more informed decisions for better investment results. Accelerated computing is the foundation for improving data throughput, reducing latency and optimizing energy usage to lower operating costs and achieve emissions goals.</p>
<h2><strong>An AI Future With Energy-Efficient Computing</strong></h2>
<p>With energy-efficient computing, enterprises can reduce data center costs and their carbon footprint while scaling AI initiatives and data workloads to stay competitive.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA accelerated computing platform offers a comprehensive suite of energy-efficient hardware and software to help enterprises use AI to drive innovation and efficiency without the need for equivalent growth in energy consumption.</p>

<h2><b>Mr_Vudoo Taps RTX for a Livestreaming Upgrade</b></h2>
<p>Mr_Vudoo’s Twitch channel is known for its variety of unique content. In his <i>Trading Card Games</i> series, Mr_Vudoo opens trading card packs and competes at one of the highest levels live on stream. In his <i>Gameplay</i> series, he goes back to his original love for gaming, streaming both multiplayer online games and third-person shooters. And in his <i>In Real Life</i> series, he breaks the norm of traditional streaming bringing his viewers outside to share his everyday life experiences.</p>
<p>It takes significant computing power to bring these series to life. Mr_Vudoo’s GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER features the eighth-generation <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-codec-sdk">NVIDIA NVENC</a> — an independent component for encoding video that frees up the system to run games or tackle other compute-intensive tasks. Using it, Mr_Vudoo can achieve a more seamless streaming experience.</p>
<p>“It’s a revelation to stream with high-quality settings and get almost no performance loss in games,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr_Vudoo can also join in the new Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting beta, powered by GeForce RTX GPUs and NVENC, to broadcast up to three resolutions simultaneously at up to 1080p. This eliminates the need to trade off resolution for stream reliability.</p>
<p>In the coming months, Enhanced Broadcasting beta testers will be able to experiment with higher input bit rates, up to 4K resolutions, support for up to five concurrent streams and new codecs.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting (Multi-Encode Streaming) Powered by NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMtA3fFnXZk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Mr_Vudoo uses a number of AI-enabled features in the video and photo editing part of his creative workflow. With RTX acceleration, he can add a video camera effect with a timed zoom and a film strip transition in real time without having to render the entire project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>AI is reshaping industries, society and the “very fabric of innovation” — and Canada is poised to play a key role in this global transformation, said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang during a fireside chat with leaders from across Canada’s thriving AI ecosystem.</p>
<p>“Canada, as you know, even though you’re so humble, you might not acknowledge it, is the epicenter of the invention of modern AI,” Huang told an audience of more than 400 from academia, industry and government gathered Thursday in Toronto.</p>
<p>In a pivotal development, Canada’s Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne shared Friday on X, formerly known as Twitter, that <a href="https://twitter.com/FP_Champagne/status/1753500161056084102">Canada has signed a letter of intent with NVIDIA</a>.</p>
<p>Nations including Canada, France, India and Japan are discussing the importance of investing in “sovereign AI capabilities,” Huang said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Canada.</p>
<p>Such efforts promise to enhance domestic computing capabilities, turbocharging local economies and unlocking local talent.</p>
<p>“Their natural resource, data, should be refined and produced for their country. The recognition of sovereign AI capabilities is global,” Huang told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Huang’s conversation with the group of Canadian AI leaders, or “four heroes of mine,” as he described them — Raquel Urtasun of Waabi, Brendan Frey of Deep Genomics, University of Toronto Professor Alan Aspuru-Guzik and Aiden Gomez of Cohere — highlighted both Canada’s enormous contributions and its growing capability as a leader in AI.</p>
<p>“Each one of you,” Huang remarked, addressing the panelists and noting that every one of them is affiliated with the University of Toronto, “are doing foundational work in some of the largest industries in the world.”</p>
<p>“Let’s seize the moment,” Champagne said as he kicked off the panel discussion. “We need to move from fear to opportunity to build trust so that people understand what AI can do for them.”</p>
<p>“It’s about inspiring young researchers to continue to do research here in Canada and about creating opportunities for them after they graduate to be able to start companies here,” Huang said.</p>
<p>The panelists echoed Huang’s optimism, providing insights into how AI is reshaping industries, society and technology.</p>
<p>Gomez, reflecting on the democratization of AI, shared his optimism for the future, stating that it’s “an exciting time to explore product space,” highlighting the vast opportunities for innovation and disruption within the AI landscape.</p>
<p>Cohere&#8217;s world-class large language models help enterprises build powerful, secure applications that search, understand meaning and converse in text.</p>
<p>Gomez said the future lies in communities of researchers and entrepreneurs able to leverage AI to bridge technological divides and foster inclusivity.</p>
<p>“I owe everything to this community, the people on the stage and in this room,” he said, acknowledging the collaborative spirit that fuels innovation in AI technologies.</p>
<p>Urtasun highlighted the imperative of safety in autonomous technology as a non-negotiable standard, emphasizing its role in saving lives and shaping the future of transportation.</p>
<p>“Safety should not be proprietary. This technology is a driver, and it’s going to save so many lives,” she said.</p>
<p>Frey underscored the transformative impact of AI in RNA biology. He said that, while “it’s taken quite a bit of time,” at Deep Genomics, he and his colleagues have built the world’s first foundation model for RNA biology, envisioning a future where drug discovery is accelerated, bringing life-saving therapies to market more efficiently.</p>
<p>“If we’re highly successful, best-case scenario, it means that we will be able to design molecules that are safe, and highly efficacious, without doing any cell model studies without doing any animal studies … and getting drugs that save our loved ones rapidly and safely,” Frey said.</p>
<p>Aspuru-Guzik pointed to the fusion of AI with quantum computing and materials science as a frontier for sustainable solutions, emphasizing the importance of creating a conducive environment for innovation in Canada.</p>
<p>“We want to build it here in Canada,” he said.</p>
<p>His work exemplifies the potential of AI to accelerate the development of new materials, driving forward a sustainable future.</p>
<p>Together, these visions articulate a future where AI enhances societal well-being, drives scientific advancement and fosters an inclusive, global community of innovation.</p>
<p>“AI is about the greatest opportunity to close the technology divide and be inclusive, for everybody to enjoy the technology revolution,” Huang said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>A new study underscores the potential of AI and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/">accelerated computing</a> to deliver <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/energy-efficiency/">energy efficiency</a> and combat climate change, efforts in which NVIDIA has long been deeply engaged.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://itif.org/publications/2024/01/29/rethinking-concerns-about-ai-energy-use/">study</a>, called “Rethinking Concerns About AI’s Energy Use,” provides a well-researched examination into how AI can — and in many cases already does — play a large role in addressing these critical needs.</p>
<p>Citing dozens of sources, the study from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a Washington-based think tank focused on science and technology policy, calls for governments to accelerate adoption of AI as a significant new tool to drive energy efficiency across many industries.</p>
<p>AI can help “reduce carbon emissions, support clean energy technologies, and address climate change,” it said.</p>
<h2><b>How AI Drives Energy Efficiency</b></h2>
<p>The report documents ways machine learning is already helping many sectors reduce their impact on the environment.</p>
<p>For example, it noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Farmers are using AI to lessen their use of fertilizer and water.</li>
<li>Utilities are adopting it to make the electric grid more efficient.</li>
<li>Logistics operations use it to optimize delivery routes, reducing the fuel consumption of their fleets.</li>
<li>Factories are deploying it to reduce waste and increase energy efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these and many other ways, the study argues that AI advances energy efficiency. So, it calls on policymakers “to ensure AI is part of the solution, not part of the problem, when it comes to the environment.”</p>
<p>It also recommends adopting AI broadly across government agencies to “help the public sector reduce carbon emissions through more efficient digital services, smart cities and buildings, intelligent transportation systems, and other AI-enabled efficiencies.”</p>
<h2><b>Reviewing the Data on AI</b></h2>
<p>The study’s author, Daniel Castro, saw in current predictions about AI a repeat of exaggerated forecasts that emerged during the rise of the internet more than two decades ago.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69584" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69584" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Daniel-Castro-ITIF-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-69584" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Daniel-Castro-ITIF-150x150.jpg" alt="Daniel Castro, ITIF" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69584" class="wp-caption-text">Daniel Castro</figcaption></figure>
<p>“People extrapolate from early studies, but don’t consider all the important variables including improvements you see over time in digitalization like energy efficiency,” said Castro, who leads ITIF’s Center for Data Innovation.</p>
<p>“The danger is policymakers could miss the big picture and hold back beneficial uses of AI that are having positive impacts, especially in regulated areas like healthcare,” he said.</p>
<p>“For example, we’ve had electronic health records since the 1980s, but it took focused government investments to get them deployed,” he added. “Now AI brings big opportunities for decarbonization across the government and the economy.”</p>
<h2><b>Optimizing Efficiency Across Data Centers</b></h2>
<p>Data centers of every size have a part to play in maximizing their energy efficiency with AI and accelerated computing.</p>
<p>For instance, NVIDIA’s AI-based weather-prediction model, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11214">FourCastNet</a>, is about 45,000x faster and consumes 12,000x less energy to produce a forecast than current techniques. That promises efficiency boosts for supercomputers around the world that run continuously to provide regional forecasts, Bjorn Stevens, director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, said in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-efficient-weather-predictions/">a blog</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, data centers could save a whopping 19 terawatt-hours of electricity a year if all AI, high performance computing and networking offloads were run on GPU and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/whats-a-dpu-data-processing-unit/">DPU</a> accelerators instead of CPUs, according to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-green-computing/">NVIDIA’s calculations</a>. That’s the equivalent of the energy consumption of 2.9 million passenger cars driven for a year.</p>
<p>Last year, the U.S. Department of Energy’s lead facility for open science documented its advances with accelerated computing.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs</a>, energy efficiency improved 5x on average across four key scientific applications <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gpu-energy-efficiency-nersc/">in tests</a> at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. An application for weather forecasting logged gains of nearly 10x.</p>

<h2><b>AI, Accelerated Computing Advance Climate Science</b></h2>
<p>The combination of accelerated computing and AI is creating new scientific instruments to help understand and combat climate change.</p>
<p>In 2021, NVIDIA <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/earth-2-supercomputer/">announced</a> Earth-2, an initiative to build a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/">digital twin</a> of Earth on a supercomputer capable of simulating climate on a global scale. It’s among a handful of similarly <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/digital-twins-climate-collaboration/">ambitious efforts</a> around the world.</p>
<p>An example is <a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/what-we-do/environmental-services-and-future-vision/destination-earth">Destination Earth</a>, a pan-European project to create digital twins of the planet, that’s using accelerated computing, AI and “collaboration on an unprecedented scale,” said the project’s leader, Peter Bauer, a veteran with more than 20 years at Europe’s top weather-forecasting center.</p>
<p>Experts in the utility sector agree AI is key to advancing sustainability.</p>
<p>“AI will play a crucial role maintaining stability for an electric grid that’s becoming exponentially more complex with large numbers of low-capacity, variable generation sources like wind and solar coming online, and two-way power flowing into and out of houses,” said Jeremy Renshaw, a senior program manager at the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent nonprofit that collaborates with more than 450 companies in 45 countries, in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-energy-grids/">a blog</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Asia’s lion city is roaring ahead in AI.</p>
<p>Singtel, a leading communications services provider based in Singapore, will bring the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/">NVIDIA AI platform</a> to businesses in the island nation and beyond.</p>
<p>The mobile and broadband company is building energy-efficient data centers across Southeast Asia accelerated with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/hopper-architecture/">NVIDIA Hopper architecture GPUs</a> and using NVIDIA AI reference architectures proven to deliver optimal performance.</p>
<p>The data centers will serve as sovereign national resources — AI factories that process the private datasets of companies, startups, universities and governments safely on shore to produce valuable insights.</p>
<p>Singtel’s first AI services will spin up in Singapore, with future data centers under construction in Indonesia and Thailand. From its hub in Singapore, the company has operations that stretch from Australia to India.</p>
<h2><b>Trusted Engines of AI</b></h2>
<p>The new data centers will act as trusted engines of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>. The most transformative technology of our time, generative AI and its ability to amplify human intelligence and productivity are attracting users worldwide.</p>
<p>Nations are creating <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language models</a> tuned to their local dialects, cultures and practices. Singtel sits at the center of such opportunities among Southeast Asia’s vibrant Chinese, Indian, Malay and other communities.</p>
<p>Singtel’s initiative supports Singapore’s national AI strategy to empower its citizens with the latest technology. The plan calls for significantly expanding the country’s compute infrastructure as well as its talent pool of machine learning specialists.</p>
<p>For businesses in the region, having a known, local provider of these computationally intensive services provides a safe, easy on-ramp to generative AI. They can enhance and personalize their products and services while protecting sensitive corporate data.</p>
<h2><b>Taking the Green Path</b></h2>
<p>Singtel is committed to democratizing AI and decarbonizing its operations.</p>
<p>Its latest data centers are being built with an eye to sustainability, including in the selection of materials and use of liquid cooling. They adopt best practices to deliver less than 1.3 in PUE, the power usage effectiveness metric for data center efficiency.</p>
<p>Singtel will use its Paragon software platform to orchestrate how the new AI applications work in concert with its mobile and broadband services. The combination will enable <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-edge-computing/">edge computing</a> services like powering robots and other autonomous systems from AI models running in the cloud.</p>
<h2><b>A Full-Stack Foundation</b></h2>
<p>The company will offer its customers <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a>, a software platform for building and deploying AI applications, including generative AI. Singtel will also be an NVIDIA Cloud Partner, delivering optimized AI services on the NVIDIA platform.</p>
<p>Because Singtel’s data centers use NVIDIA’s proven reference architectures for AI computing, users can employ its services, knowing they’re optimized for leading AI performance.</p>
<p>Singtel already has hands-on experience delivering edge services with NVIDIA AI.</p>
<p>Last May, it <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/singtel-microsoft-ai-over-5g/">demonstrated a digital avatar</a> created with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a> platforms that users could interact with over its 5G network. And in 2021, Singtel delivered GPU services as part of a testbed for local government agencies.</p>
<h2><b>New AI Role for Telcos</b></h2>
<p>Singapore’s service provider joins pioneers in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/scaleway-european-startups-inception/">France</a>, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-india-giants-ai/">India</a>, Italy and Switzerland deploying AI factories that deliver generative AI services with data sovereignty.</p>
<p>To learn more about how Singtel and other telcos are embracing generative AI, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/session-catalog/?tab.allsessions=1700692987788001F1cG&amp;search=S62491#/session/1696278201820001fGOk">register for a session</a> on the topic at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/">NVIDIA GTC</a>. The global AI conference runs March 18-21, starting with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/keynote/">a keynote</a> by NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang.</p>

<h2><b>Stepping Into Magical Worlds</b></h2>
<p>Tieh’s scene began as a sketch of what he envisioned to be a giant door in a grassy field.</p>
<p>“A very broad and abstract thought — but that’s sort of the point of fantasy,” he explained.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69494" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-69494 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w-672x270.png" alt="" width="672" height="270" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w-672x270.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w-400x161.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w-768x309.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w-842x339.png 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w-406x163.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w-188x76.png 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zbrush-studio-world-brandon-tieh-wk94-highresscreenshot00228-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69494" class="wp-caption-text">Tieh specializes in building impressive worlds.</figcaption></figure>
<p>To bring it to life, he began by gathering assets such as rocks and grass from Quixel Megascans, the Unreal Engine Marketplace and ArtStation Marketplace.</p>
<p>The door required extra customization, so he modeled one from scratch, first sculpting it in ZBrush before importing it into Adobe 3D Substance Painter for a quick texture pass. Tieh’s GeForce RTX graphics card used RTX-accelerated light and ambient occlusion to bake assets in mere seconds.</p>

<p>With the textured assets in place, Tieh next built the scene in Unreal Engine. His technique involves focusing on the big shapes by looking at the scene in a smaller thumbnail view, then flipping the canvas to refresh his perspective — very similar to the approach concept artists use. He adjusted lighting by deploying the same technique.</p>

<p>Unreal Engine users can tap <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS</a> Super Resolution to increase the interactivity of the viewport by using AI to upscale frames rendered at lower resolution, and enhance image quality using DLSS Ray Reconstruction.</p>
<p>Fog is another major component of the scene. “Fog is generally darker and more opaque in the background and becomes lighter and more translucent as it approaches the foreground,” said Tieh. He primarily used fog cards in Unreal Engine’s free Blueprints Visual Scripting system to add a paint-like effect.</p>
<p>The majority of lighting was artificial, meaning Tieh had to use a significant number of individually placed light sources, but “it looks very believable if executed well,” he explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Hip disorders, comprising some of the world’s most common joint diseases, are especially prevalent among adolescents and young adults, causing stiffness, pain or a limp. But they can be hard to diagnose using solely 2D medical imaging.</p>
<p>Helping to treat these disorders, the Boston Children’s Hospital’s (BCH’s) Adolescent and Young Adult Hip Preservation Program is the U.S.’s first to deploy a fully automated AI tool across its clinic.</p>
<p>Called VirtualHip, the tool can create a 3D model of a hip from routine medical images, assess anatomy and movement-related issues, and provide clinicians with diagnostic and treatment guidance. It was built at an orthopedic research lab at BCH, Harvard Medical School’s primary pediatric hospital, using the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DGX platform</a>.</p>
<p>A team of 10 researchers are working on the project, funded in part by an <a href="https://nvidia.my.site.com/HardwareGrant/s/Application" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Academic Hardware Grant</a>, including engineers, computer scientists, orthopedic surgeons, radiologists and software developers.</p>
<p>“Using AI, clinicians can get more value out of the clinical data they routinely collect,” said Dr. Ata Kiapour, the lab’s principal investigator, director of the musculoskeletal informatics group at BCH and assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Harvard Medical School. “This tool can augment their performance to make better choices in diagnosis and treatment, and free their time to focus on giving patients the best care.”</p>
<h2><b>Getting Straight to the Joint</b></h2>
<p>Often, clinicians must determine a treatment plan — with levels of intervention ranging from physical therapy to total hip replacement — based on just a 2D image, such as an X-ray, CT scan or MRI. Automatically creating 3D models from these images, and using them to conduct comprehensive joint assessments, can help improve the accuracy of diagnosis to inform treatment planning.</p>
<p>“I started a postdoc with an orthopedic surgeon at BCH in 2013, when I saw how an engineer or scientist could help with patient treatment,” said Dr. Kiapour, who’s also trained as a biomedical engineer. “Over the years, I saw that hospitals have a ton of data, but efficient data processing for clinical use was a huge, unmet need.”</p>
<p>VirtualHip, fully integrated with BCH’s hip clinic and radiology database, helps to fill this gap.</p>
<p>Clinicians can log in to the software tool through a web-based portal, view and interact with 3D simulations of 2D medical images, submit analysis requests and see results within an hour — 4x quicker on average than receiving a radiology report after imaging.</p>
<p>The tool, which produces 3D models with a margin of error less than one millimeter, can assess morphological abnormalities and identify issues related to hip motion, such as pain from hip bones rubbing against each other.</p>
<p>VirtualHip was developed using a database with tens of millions of clinical notes and imaging data from patients seen at BCH over the past two decades. Using natural language processing models and computer vision algorithms, Dr. Kiapour’s team processed this data, training the tool to analyze normal versus pathologic hip development and identify factors influencing the injury risk and treatment outcomes.</p>
<p>This will enable VirtualHip to offer patient-specific risk assessment and treatment planning by comparing current patients to previously treated ones with similar demographic backgrounds.</p>
<p>“The hardware support that we got from NVIDIA made all of this possible,” Dr. Kiapour said. “DGX enabled advanced computations on more than 20 years’ worth of historical data for our fine-tuned clinical AI model.”</p>
<h2><b>Clearer Explanations, Better Outcomes for Patients</b></h2>
<p>In addition to assisting doctors in diagnosis and treatment planning, VirtualHip helps patients better understand their condition.</p>
<p>“When patients look at an X-ray, it doesn’t look like a real hip — but with a 3D model that can be rotated, the doctor can show exactly where the joints are impinging or unstable,” Dr. Kiapour said. “This lets the patient better understand their disorder, which usually makes them more compliant with whatever the doctor’s prescribing.”</p>
<p>This type of visualization is especially helpful for children and younger adults, Kiapour added.</p>
<p>The VirtualHip project is under continuous development, including work toward a patient-facing platform — using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language models</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> — for personalized analyses and treatment recommendations.</p>
<p>The BCH researchers plan to commercialize the product for use in other hospitals.</p>
