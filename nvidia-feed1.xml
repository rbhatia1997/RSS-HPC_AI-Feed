										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>These days, just about everyone is a content creator.

					<description><![CDATA[YouTube content creator Ralph Panebianco really, really loves video games. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of our weekly </i><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/in-the-nvidia-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/"><i>NVIDIA Studio</i></a><i> technology improves creative workflows. We’re also deep diving on new </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/"><i>GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU</i></a><i> features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.</i></p>
<p>YouTube content creator Ralph Panebianco really, <i>really</i> loves video games.</p>
<p>Since getting an original Nintendo Entertainment System at the age of four, Panebianco, this week’s featured <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i> creator, has spent much of his free time playing video games. He pursued a career in gaming in his native country of Australia before pivoting to content creation, opening a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SkillUp">Skill Up</a>, where he reviews the latest video games.</p>
<p>“When I wasn’t playing video games, I was reading about them, and now I get to talk about them for a living,” he said.</p>
<p>And calling all art fans: the latest Studio Standouts video features film noir-themed artwork brought to life with dramatic, monochromatic flair.</p>
<p><iframe title="Film Noir: A Community Digital Art Showcase | NVIDIA Studio Standouts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uzp-5r8DluY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Video Editing Skillz</b></h2>
<p>Panebianco works with his partner to create in-depth, insightful reviews of the latest video games on his Skill Up YouTube channel, which has garnered nearly 1 million subscribers. Below is a recent video reviewing <i>Pacific Drive, </i>a title available on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/">NVIDIA GeForce NOW</a> cloud gaming service, powered by GeForce RTX GPUs.</p>
<p><iframe title="I strongly recommend: Pacific Drive (Review)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXxJ_66ksD4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>“Creatively, we don’t view game reviews as functional buying guides with a list of pros and cons,” said Panebianco. “We view reviews as a chance to crack a game open and really show the audience what makes it tick. They’re sort of mini-essays on game design, delving deep into why specific game mechanics do or don’t work.”</p>
<p>The content creation process begins with booting up the game on his PC, powered by the recently launched <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4080-family/">GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER</a> graphics card. This allows the Skill Up team to tap <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">RTX ray tracing</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS</a> — breakthrough technologies that use AI to create additional frames and improve image quality.</p>
<p>He records video footage primarily using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/">GeForce Experience</a>, a companion to NVIDIA GeForce GPUs that enables users to capture assets, optimize game settings and keep drivers up to date, among other features.</p>
<p>When footage requires high-dynamic range, the team uses the OBS Studio open-source software with AV1 hardware encoding to achieve <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/av1-obs29-youtube/">40% more efficient encoding</a> on average than H.264 and deliver higher quality than competing GPUs.</p>
<p>“The AV1 encoder is ridiculously efficient in terms of file size,” he said.</p>

<p>Once the footage is ready, Panebianco writes a video script in Microsoft Word and then records himself, using Audacity. He uses the AI-powered <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/">NVIDIA Broadcast</a> app, free for RTX GPU owners, to eliminate background noise and achieve professional studio quality.</p>
<p>Panebianco then hands off the files to his editor for production in Adobe Premiere Pro, where a number of GPU-accelerated, AI-powered features such as Enhance Speech, Auto Reframe and Unsharp Mask help speed the video editing process.</p>

<p>Next, Panebianco exports the final files twice as fast thanks to the dual AV1 encoders in his RTX GPU. Lastly, his editor creates a YouTube thumbnail in Adobe Photoshop, and then the video is ready for publishing.</p>

<p>“Almost my entire workflow was enhanced by NVIDIA’s hardware,” Panebianco shared. “It’s not just about the hardware making for efficient encoding or lightning-fast, hardware-enabled rendering — it’s about the end-to-end toolset.”</p>
<p>Panebianco has words of wisdom for aspiring content creators.</p>
<p>“Worry less about the numbers and more about the quality,” he said. “The metrics grind pays little in the way of dividends, but putting out truly excellent content is an almost failure-proof path to growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The spirit of software pioneer Grace Hopper will live on at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/">NVIDIA GTC</a>.</p>
<p>Accelerated systems using powerful processors — named in honor of the pioneer of software programming — will be on display at the global AI conference running March 18-21, ready to take computing to the next level.</p>
<p>System makers will show more than 500 servers in multiple configurations across 18 racks, all packing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/">NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips</a>. They’ll form the largest display at NVIDIA’s booth in the San Jose Convention Center, filling the MGX Pavilion.</p>
<h2><b>MGX Speeds Time to Market</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/mgx/">NVIDIA MGX</a> is a blueprint for building accelerated servers with any combination of GPUs, CPUs and data processing units (<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/whats-a-dpu-data-processing-unit/">DPUs</a>) for a wide range of AI, high performance computing and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> applications. It’s a modular reference architecture for use across multiple product generations and workloads.</p>
<p>GTC attendees can get an up-close look at MGX models tailored for enterprise, cloud and telco-edge uses, such as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> inference, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/whats-a-recommender-system/">recommenders</a> and data analytics.</p>
<p>The pavilion will showcase accelerated systems packing single and dual GH200 Superchips in 1U and 2U chassis, linked via <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/data-processing-unit/">NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/">NVIDIA Quantum-2</a> 400Gb/s InfiniBand networks over <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/interconnect/">LinkX</a> cables and transceivers.</p>
<p>The systems support industry standards for 19- and 21-inch rack enclosures, and many provide E1.S bays for nonvolatile storage.</p>
<h2><b>Grace Hopper in the Spotlight</b></h2>
<p>Here’s a sampler of MGX systems now available:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASRock RACK’s MECAI, measuring 450 x 445 x 87mm, accelerates AI and 5G services in constrained spaces at the edge of telco networks.</li>
<li>ASUS’s MGX server, the ESC NM2N-E1, slides into a rack that holds up to 32 GH200 processors and supports air- and water-cooled nodes.</li>
<li>Foxconn provides a suite of MGX systems, including a 4U model that accommodates up to eight NVIDIA H100 NVL PCIe Tensor Core GPUs.</li>
<li>GIGABYTE’s <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/Server/XH23-VG0-rev-AAJ1">XH23-VG0-MGX</a> can accommodate plenty of storage in its six 2.5-inch Gen5 NVMe hot-swappable bays and two M.2 slots.</li>
<li>Inventec’s systems can slot into 19- and 21-inch racks and use three different implementations of liquid cooling.</li>
<li>Lenovo supplies a range of 1U, 2U and 4U MGX servers, including models that support direct liquid cooling.</li>
<li>Pegatron’s air-cooled AS201-1N0 server packs a BlueField-3 DPU for software-defined, hardware-accelerated networking.</li>
<li>QCT can stack 16 of its QuantaGrid D74S-IU systems, each with two GH200 Superchips, into a single QCT QoolRack.</li>
<li>Supermicro’s ARS-111GL-NHR with nine hot-swappable fans is part of a portfolio of air- and liquid-cooled GH200 and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-cpu/">NVIDIA Grace CPU</a> systems.</li>
<li>Wiwynn’s SV7200H, a 1U dual GH200 system, supports a BlueField-3 DPU and a liquid-cooling subsystem that can be remotely managed.</li>
<li>Wistron’s MGX servers are 4U GPU systems for AI inference and mixed workloads, supporting up to eight accelerators in one system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new servers are in addition to three accelerated systems using MGX<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/computex-keynote-generative-ai/"> announced at COMPUTEX</a> last May — Supermicro’s ARS-221GL-NR using the Grace CPU and QCT’s QuantaGrid S74G-2U and S74GM-2U powered by the GH200.</p>
<h2><b>Grace Hopper Packs Two in One</b></h2>
<p>System builders are adopting the hybrid processor because it packs a punch.</p>
<p>GH200 Superchips combine a high-performance, power-efficient Grace CPU with a muscular <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 GPU</a>. They share hundreds of gigabytes of memory over a fast <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink-c2c/">NVIDIA NVLink-C2C</a> interconnect.</p>
<p>The result is a processor and memory complex well-suited to take on today’s most demanding jobs, such as running <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language models</a>. They have the memory and speed needed to link generative AI models to data sources that can improve their accuracy using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, aka RAG.</p>
<h2><b>Recommenders Run 4x Faster</b></h2>
<p>In addition, the GH200 Superchip delivers greater efficiency and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/grace-hopper-recommender-systems/">up to 4x more performance</a> than using the H100 GPU with traditional CPUs for tasks like making recommendations for online shopping or media streaming.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/grace-hopper-inference-mlperf/">debut</a> on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/mlperf-benchmarks/">MLPerf</a> industry benchmarks last November, GH200 systems ran all data center inference tests, extending the already leading performance of H100 GPUs.</p>
<p>In all these ways, GH200 systems are taking to new heights a computing revolution their namesake helped start on the first mainframe computers more than seven decades ago.</p>

<p>A failed furniture-shopping trip turned into a business idea for Steven Gay, cofounder and CEO of company <a href="https://www.modemaisonlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mode Maison</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-69984 size-thumbnail" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo-400x400.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo-450x450.jpg 450w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo-215x215.jpg 215w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo-100x100.jpg 100w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Steven_Gay_photo.jpg 495w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p>Gay grew up in Houston and studied at the University of Texas before working in New York as one of the youngest concept designers at Ralph Lauren. He was inspired to start his own company after a long day of trying — and failing — to pick out a sofa.</p>
<p>The experience illuminated how the luxury home-goods industry has traditionally lagged in adopting digital technologies, especially those for creating immersive, interactive experiences for consumers.</p>
<p>Gay founded Mode Maison in 2018 with the goal of solving this challenge and paving the way for scalability, creativity and a generative future in retail. Using the Universal Scene Description framework, aka <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">OpenUSD</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platform, Gay, along with Mode Maison Chief Technology Officer Jakub Cech and the Mode Maison team, are helping enhance and digitalize entire product lifecycle processes — from design and manufacturing to consumer experiences.</p>

<p>They developed a photometric scanning system, called <a href="https://www.tmac.dev/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Total Material Appearance Capture</a>, which offers an unbiased, physically based approach to digitizing the material world that’s enabled by real-world embedded sensors.</p>
<p>TMAC captures proprietary data and the composition of any material, then turns it into input that serves as a single source of truth, which can be used for creating a fully digitized retail model. Using the system, along with OpenUSD and NVIDIA Omniverse, Mode Maison customers can create highly accurate <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/digital-twins/">digital twins</a> of any material or product.</p>
<p>“By enabling this, we’re effectively collapsing and fostering a complete integration across the entire product lifecycle process — from design and production to manufacturing to consumer experiences and beyond,” said Gay.</p>

<h2><b>Streamlining Workflows and Enhancing Productivity With Digital Twins</b></h2>
<p>Previously, Mode Maison faced significant challenges in creating physically based, highly flexible and scalable digital materials. The limitations were particularly noticeable when rendering complex materials and textures, or integrating digital models into cohesive, multilayered environments.</p>
<p>Using Omniverse helped Gay and his team overcome these challenges by offering advanced rendering capabilities, physics simulations and extensibility for AI training that unlock new possibilities in digital retail.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-69990 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-672x378.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-768x431.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-801x450.jpg 801w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-383x215.jpg 383w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/random-page3-1280x719.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>Before using Omniverse and OpenUSD, Mode Maison used disjointed processes for digital material capture, modeling and rendering, often leading to inconsistencies, the inability to scale and minimal interoperability. After integrating Omniverse, the company experienced a streamlined, coherent workflow where high-fidelity digital twins can be created with greater efficiency and interoperability.</p>
<p>The team primarily uses Autodesk 3ds Max for design, and they import the 3D data using Omniverse Connectors. Gay says OpenUSD is playing an increasingly critical role in its workflows, especially when developing composable, flexible, interoperable capabilities across asset creation.</p>
<p>This enhanced pipeline starts with capturing high-fidelity material data using TMAC. The data is then processed and formatted into OpenUSD for the creation of physically based, scientifically accurate, high-fidelity digital twins.</p>
<p>“OpenUSD allows for an unprecedented level of collaboration and interoperability in creating complex, multi-layered capabilities and advanced digital materials,” Gay said. “Its ability to seamlessly integrate diverse digital assets and maintain their fidelity across various applications is instrumental in creating realistic, interactive digital twins for retail.”</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Detail_602-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-69993 size-large" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Detail_602-672x378.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Detail_602-672x378.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Detail_602-400x225.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Detail_602-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Detail_602-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Detail_602-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Detail_602-800x450.jpg 800w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Detail_602-382x215.jpg 382w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Detail_602-178x100.jpg 178w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Detail_602-1280x720.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>OpenUSD and Omniverse have sped Mode Maison and their clients’ ability to bring products to market, reduced costs associated with building and modifying digital twins, and enhanced productivity through streamlined creation.</p>
<p>“Our work represents a major step toward a future where digital and physical realities will be seamlessly integrated,” said Gay. “This shift enhances consumer engagement and paves the way for more sustainable business practices by reducing the need for physical prototyping while enabling more precise manufacturing.”</p>
<p>As for emerging technological advancements in digital retail, Gay says AI will play a central role in creating hyper-personalized design, production, sourcing and front-end consumer experiences — all while reducing carbon footprints and paving the way for a more sustainable future in retail.</p>

<p>And this week <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i>, filmmaker James Matthews shares his short film, <i>Dive</i>, which was created with an Adobe Premiere Pro-powered workflow supercharged by his ASUS ZenBook Pro <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/laptops-desktops/">NVIDIA Studio</a> laptop with a GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card.</p>
<h2><b>Going With the Flow</b></h2>
<p>Matthews’ goal with <i>Dive</i> was to create a visual and auditory representation of what it feels like to get swallowed up in the creative editing process.</p>
<figure id="attachment_69919" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69919" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-69919" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-672x250.png" alt="" width="672" height="250" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-672x250.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-400x149.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-768x286.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-842x314.png 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-406x151.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w-188x70.png 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-james-matthews-wk97-nice-view-1280w.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-69919" class="wp-caption-text">Talk about a dream content creation location.</figcaption></figure>
<p>“When I’m really deep into an edit, I sometimes feel like I’m fully immersed into the film and the editing process itself,” he said. “It’s almost like a flow state, where time stands still and you are one with your own creativity.”</p>
<p>To capture and visualize that feeling, Matthews used the power of his ASUS ZenBook Pro NVIDIA Studio laptop equipped with a GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card.</p>
<p>He started by brainstorming — listening to music and sketching conceptual images with pencil and paper. Then, Matthews added a song to his Adobe Premiere Pro timeline and created a shot list, complete with cuts and descriptions of focal range, speed, camera movement, lighting and other details.</p>
<p>Next, he planned location and shooting times, paying special attention to lighting conditions.</p>
<p>“I always have my Premiere Pro timeline up so I can really see and feel what I need to create from the images I originally drew while building the concept in my head,” Matthews said. “This helps get the pacing of each shot right, by watching it back and possibly adding it into the timeline for a test.”</p>
<p>Then, Matthews started editing the footage in Premiere Pro, aided by his Studio laptop. His dedicated GPU-based NVIDIA video encoder (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-codec-sdk">NVENC</a>) enabled buttery-smooth playback and scrubbing of his high-resolution and multi-stream footage, saving countless hours.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA Studio | RTX Accelerates Adobe Premiere Pro" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/poTeo7Ft3xk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Matthews’ RTX GPU accelerated a variety of <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/ai-video-editing.html">AI-powered Adobe video editing tools</a>, such as Enhance Speech, Scene Edit Detection and Auto Color, which applies color corrections with just a few clicks.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Real-Time Video Editing and Faster Rendering in Adobe Premiere Pro with NVIDIA RTX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnVsfZT1wHU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, Matthews added sound design before exporting the final files twice as fast thanks to NVENC’s dual AV1 encoders.</p>
<p>“The entire edit used GPU acceleration,” he shared. “Effects in Premiere Pro, along with the NVENC video encoders on the GPU, unlocked a seamless workflow and essentially allowed me to get into my flow state faster.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/news/"><i>Into the Omniverse</i></a><i>, a series focused on how artists, developers and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advances in </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>OpenUSD</i></a><i> and </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/"><i>NVIDIA Omniverse</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<p>The combination of powerful 3D tools and groundbreaking technologies can transform the way designers bring their visions to life — and Universal Scene Description, or <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/">OpenUSD</a>, is helping enable that synergy. It’s the framework on which the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platform that enables the development of OpenUSD-based tools and 3D workflows is based.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhinoceros</a>, commonly known as Rhino, or Rhino 3D, is a powerful computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D modeling software used across industries — from education and jewelry design to architecture and marine modeling. The most recent software release includes support for OpenUSD export, among other updates, establishing it among the many applications embracing the new 3D standard.</p>
<h2><b>Turning Creativity Into CAD Reality</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tanjalanggner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tanja Langgner</a>, 3D artist and illustrator, grew up in Austria and now lives in a converted pigsty in the English countryside. With a background in industrial design, she’s had the opportunity to work with a slew of design agencies across Europe.</p>
<p>For the past decade, she’s undertaken freelance work in production and visualization, helping clients with tasks ranging from concept design and ideation to CAD and 3D modeling. Often doing industrial design work, Langgner relies on Rhino to construct CAD models,  whether for production evaluation or rendering purposes.</p>
<p>When faced with designs requiring intricate surface patterns, “Rhino’s Grasshopper, a parametric modeler, is excellent in creating complex parametric shapes,” she said.</p>
<p>Langgner is no stranger to OpenUSD. She uses it to transfer assets easily from one application to another, allowing her to visualize her work more efficiently. With the new Rhino update, she can now export OpenUSD files from Rhino, further streamlining her design workflow.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/mathew-schwartz-openusd-omniverse/">Mathew Schwartz</a>, an assistant professor in architecture and design at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, also uses Rhino and OpenUSD in his 3D workflows. Schwartz’s research and design lab, <a href="https://www.siborglab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SiBORG</a>, focuses on understanding and improving design workflows, especially with regard to accessibility, human factors and automation.</p>
<p>With OpenUSD, he can combine his research, Python code, 3D environments and renders, with his favorite tools in Omniverse.</p>
<p>Schwartz, along with Langgner, recently joined a community livestream, where he shared more details about his research — including how he&#8217;s made navigation graphs that show how someone can move in a space if they’re using a wheelchair or crutches in real-time. With his industrial design experience, he demonstrated computation using Rhino 3D and the use of generative AI for a seamless design process.</p>
<p>“With OpenUSD and Omniverse, we’ve been able to expand the scope of our research, as we can easily combine data analysis and visualization with the design process,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA, in collaboration with Google, today launched optimizations across all NVIDIA AI platforms for <a href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-open-models/">Gemma</a> — Google’s state-of-the-art new lightweight <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/gemma-2b">2 billion</a>&#8211; and <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/gemma-7b">7 billion</a>-parameter open language models that can be run anywhere, reducing costs and speeding innovative work for domain-specific use cases.</p>
<p>Teams from the companies worked closely together to accelerate the performance of Gemma — built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models — with <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a>, an open-source library for optimizing large language model inference, when running on NVIDIA GPUs in the data center, in the cloud, and locally on workstations with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX</a> GPUs or PCs with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/">GeForce RTX</a> GPUs.</p>
<p>This allows developers to target the installed base of over 100 million NVIDIA RTX GPUs available in high-performance AI PCs globally.</p>
<p>Developers can also run Gemma on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud, including on Google Cloud’s A3 instances based on the H100 Tensor Core GPU and soon, NVIDIA’s <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-supercharges-hopper-the-worlds-leading-ai-computing-platform">H200 Tensor Core GPUs</a> — featuring 141GB of HBM3e memory at 4.8 terabytes per second — which Google will deploy this year.</p>
<p>Enterprise developers can additionally take advantage of NVIDIA’s rich ecosystem of tools — including <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo">NeMo framework</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM">TensorRT-LLM</a> — to fine-tune Gemma and deploy the optimized model in their production applications.</p>
<p>Learn more about how <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-revs-up-inference-for-google-gemma/">TensorRT-LLM is revving up inference for Gemma</a>, along with additional information for developers. This includes several model checkpoints of Gemma and the FP8-quantized version of the model, all optimized with TensorRT-LLM.</p>
<p>Experience <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/gemma-2b">Gemma 2B</a> and <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/gemma-7b">Gemma 7B</a> directly from your browser on the NVIDIA AI Playground.</p>
<h2><b>Gemma Coming to Chat With RTX</b></h2>
<p>Adding support for Gemma soon is <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/chat-with-rtx-available-now/">Chat with RTX</a>, an NVIDIA tech demo that uses <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation</a> and TensorRT-LLM software to give users generative AI capabilities on their local, RTX-powered Windows PCs.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Create A Personalized AI Chatbot with Chat With RTX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gdsRJZT3IJw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The Chat with RTX lets users personalize a chatbot with their own data by easily connecting local files on an RTX PC to a large language model.</p>
<p>Since the model runs locally, it provides results fast, and user data stays on the device. Rather than relying on cloud-based LLM services, Chat with RTX lets users process sensitive data on a local PC without the need to share it with a third party or have an internet connection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>It’s been five years since the telecommunications industry first deployed 5G networks to drive new performance levels for customers and unlock new value for telcos.</p>
<p>But that industry milestone has been overshadowed by the emergence of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> and the swift pace at which telcos are embracing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/">large language models</a> as they seek to transform all parts of their business.</p>
<p>A recent survey of more than 400 telecommunications industry professionals from around the world showed that generative AI is the breakout technology of the year and that enthusiasm and adoption for both generative AI, and AI in general, is booming. In addition, the survey showed that, among respondents, AI is improving both revenues and cost savings.</p>
<p>The generative AI insight is the main highlight in the second edition of NVIDIA’s “State of AI in Telecommunications” survey, which included questions covering a range of AI topics, including infrastructure spending, top use cases, biggest challenges and deployment models.</p>
<p>Survey respondents included C-suite leaders, managers, developers and IT architects from mobile telecoms, fixed and cable companies. The survey was conducted over eight weeks between October and December.</p>

<h2><b>Ramping Up on Generative AI</b></h2>
<p>The survey results show how generative AI went from relative obscurity in 2022 to a key solution within a year. Forty-three percent of respondents reported they were investing in it, showing clear evidence that the telecom industry is enthusiastically embracing the generative AI wave to address a wide variety of business goals.</p>
<p>More broadly, there was a marked increase in interest in adopting AI and growing expectations of success from the technology, especially among industry executives. In the survey, 53% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that adopting AI will be a source of competitive advantage, compared to 39% who reported the same in 2022. For management respondents, the figure was 56%.</p>
<p>The primary reason for this sustained engagement is because many industry stakeholders expect AI to contribute to their company’s success. Overall, 56% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that “AI is important to my company’s future success,” with the figure rising to 61% among decision-making management respondents. The overall figure is a 14-point boost over the 42% result from the 2022 survey.</p>
<h2><b>Customer Experience Remains Key Driver of AI Investment </b></h2>
<p>Telcos are adopting AI and generative AI to address a wide variety of business needs. Overall, 31% of respondents said they invested in at least six AI use cases in 2023, while 40% are planning to scale to six or more use cases in 2024.</p>
<p>But enhancing customer experiences remains the biggest AI opportunity for the telecom industry, with 48% of survey respondents selecting it as their main goal for using the technology. Likewise, some 35% of respondents identified customer experiences as their key AI success story.</p>
<p>For generative AI, 57% are using it to improve customer service and support, 57% to improve employee productivity, 48% for network operations and management, 40% for network planning and design, and 32% for marketing content generation.</p>
<h2><b>Early Phase of AI Investment Cycle</b></h2>
<p>The focus on customer experience is influencing investments. Investing in customer-experience optimization remains the most popular AI use case for 2023 (49% of respondents) and for generative AI investments (57% of respondents).</p>
<p>Telcos are also investing in other AI use cases: security (42%), network predictive maintenance (37%), network planning and operations (34%) and field operations (34%) are notable examples. However, using AI for fraud detection in transactions and payments had the biggest jump in popularity between 2022 and 2023, rising 14 points to 28% of respondents.</p>
<p>Overall, investments in AI are still in an early phase of the investment cycle, although growing strongly. In the survey, 43% of respondents reported an investment of over $1 million in AI in their previous year, 52% reported the same for the current year, and 66% reported their budget for AI infrastructure will increase in the next year.</p>
<p>For those who are already investing in AI, 67% reported that AI adoption has helped them increase revenues, with 19% of respondents noting that this revenue growth is more than 10% in specific business areas. Likewise, 63% reported that AI adoption has helped them reduce costs in specific business areas, with 14% noting that this cost reduction is more than 10%.</p>
<h2><b>Innovation With Partners</b></h2>
<p>While telcos are increasing their investments to improve their internal AI capabilities, partnerships remain critical for the adoption of AI solutions in the industry. This is applicable both for AI models and AI hardware infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the survey, 44% of respondents reported that co-development with partners is their company’s preferred approach to building AI solutions. Some 28% of respondents prefer to use open-source tools, while 25% take an AI-as-a-service approach. For generative AI, 29% of respondents built or customized models with a partner, an understandable conservative approach for the telecom industry with its stringent data protection rules.</p>
<p>For infrastructure, increasingly, many telcos are opting for cloud hosting, although the hybrid model still remains dominant. In the survey, 31% of respondents reported that they run most of their AI workloads in the cloud (44% for hybrid), compared to 21% of respondents in the previous survey (56% for hybrid). This is helping to fuel the growing need for more localized cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>“Understanding how every person has a different upbringing and how the decisions they made took them to different places is absolutely inspiring,” said Toro. “When I discover a story worth telling, I just feel a necessity to tell it — and tell it right.”</p>
<p>It’s those stories that gave rise to <i>Cinematic Portraits</i>, a photo and video collection of people Toro’s befriended, such as Korean painter Kim Nam Soon, age 81, who impressively learned how to paint at 65.</p>
<div style="width: 1280px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-69821-1" width="1280" height="720" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-esteban-toro-kim-cinematic-1280w.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-esteban-toro-kim-cinematic-1280w.mp4">https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-esteban-toro-kim-cinematic-1280w.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toro’s planning process is long and thorough — he can only retell stories by first having a conversation with each subject, making sure that they understand what the project is about and building a relationship with them so they feel comfortable enough to authentically share.</p>
<p>He captures video and photos of his subjects using Hasselblad and Sony camera gear. Then, he uses Adobe apps, accelerated by GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX technology, in post-production.</p>
<p>Toro deployed the Enhance Speech tool to boost the clarity and quality of voice recordings and adjusted enhancement levels with the Mix Amount setting — all powered by AI. The feature is 75% faster on a GeForce RTX 4090 laptop GPU compared with an RTX 3080 Ti.</p>
<p>“Without AI, the footage, filmed in challenging, noisy conditions, would be unusable,” he said.</p>
<p>The Text-Based Editing tool in Premiere Pro allowed Toro to use speech-to-text AI capabilities to automatically create captions, supported in 18 languages, for video footage — speeding the editing process.</p>

<p>Adobe offers a wide variety of time-saving features, such as the AI-powered Auto Reframe tool for automated editing in multiple size formats for social media with <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro-next/organize-media/import-files/use-project-templates.html">project templates</a>. Toro’s <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/">NVIDIA Studio laptop</a> with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4070-family/">GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card</a> accelerates all of these powerful tools.</p>
<p>Final file exports were achieved 4x faster than with a CPU alone thanks to the GPU-accelerated NVIDIA video encoder (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-codec-sdk">NVENC</a>). Toro quickly and easily added finishing touches in Photoshop Lightroom, using the RTX-accelerated, AI-powered Raw Details feature to refine the color detail of his high-resolution RAW images, and the Super Resolution feature to upscale images with higher quality than traditional methods.</p>
<p>“Having a dedicated GPU for video projects when filming high-quality video is almost mandatory,” said Toro. “Using NVIDIA GPUs allows me to render and process my projects faster, so the post-processing tools are serving my creative ideas, and I’m not limited by what the computer can do, but exactly what I want to create.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Providing a peek at the architecture powering advanced AI factories, NVIDIA Thursday released a video that offers the first public look at Eos, its latest data-center-scale supercomputer.</p>
<p>An extremely large-scale <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/">NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD</a>, Eos is where NVIDIA developers create their AI breakthroughs using accelerated computing infrastructure and fully optimized software.</p>
<p>Eos is built with 576 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-h100/">NVIDIA DGX H100</a> systems, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/">NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking</a> and software, providing a total of 18.4 exaflops of FP8 AI performance. This system is a sister to a <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.nvidia.com%2Fblog%2Fscaling-ai-training-mlperf%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cgrainville%40nvidia.com%7Cc7f631fdf68a4870460808dc3174aac0%7C43083d15727340c1b7db39efd9ccc17a%7C0%7C0%7C638439624354202777%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=t8JYd63NQeTU341PEhKkonuqdW7wsCTU%2FP7Fm8AR7Jo%3D&amp;reserved=0" data-auth="NotApplicable">separate Eos DGX SuperPOD with 10,752 NVIDIA H100 GPUs</a>, used for MLPerf training in November.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J8-CgG5ewJQ?si=Ke2AmFde1VPZS2Jf" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><i></i><br />
Eos’s architecture is optimized for AI workloads demanding ultra-low-latency and high-throughput interconnectivity across a large cluster of accelerated computing nodes, making it an ideal solution for enterprises looking to scale their AI capabilities.</p>
<p>Based on NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand with In-Network Computing technology, its network architecture supports data transfer speeds of up to 400Gb/s, facilitating the rapid movement of large datasets essential for training complex AI models.</p>
<p>At the heart of Eos lies the groundbreaking DGX SuperPOD architecture powered by NVIDIA’s DGX H100 systems.</p>
<p>The architecture is built to provide the AI and computing fields with tightly integrated full-stack systems capable of computing at an enormous scale.</p>
<p>As enterprises and developers worldwide seek to harness the power of AI, Eos stands as a pivotal resource, promising to accelerate the journey towards AI-infused applications that fuel every organization.</p>

NVIDIA’s automotive partners are using digitalization to transform every phase of the product lifecycle — evolving primarily physical, manual processes into software-driven, AI-enhanced digital systems.</p>
<p>Watch the video to learn more.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Digitalization: A Game Changer for the Auto Industry" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2J-o0tO7-98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Digitalization: A Game Changer From End to End</b></h2>
<p>Kaivan Karimi, global partner strategy lead at Microsoft, observes that companies are achieving “huge” results from “digitizing the physical entity, running simulations and rendering in 3D, whether it’s factory automation or modernizing the design and development of the car.”</p>
<p>Brian Ullem, vice president of engineering at Capgemini, explains that, with “the 30,000 parts that go into a car, it takes approximately five years to develop a vehicle end to end. Instead of building 50 or 100 cars, we can use digitalization to simulate without having to build prototypes. That saves a lot of time and money in the process.”</p>
<p>Thomas Mueller, chief technology officer of engineering at Wipro, adds that with digitalization, “we are now able to run simulations at a low cost…and improve the user experience.”</p>
<h2><b>Simulation: Critical for Autonomous Driving</b></h2>
<p>“Simulation is crucial to the development of autonomous systems,” says Ziv Binyamini, CEO of Foretellix. “On one hand, you need the real world, but this is highly costly. So you have to complement it with the ability to simulate a virtual world where everything is possible. And then you can, in a very cost-effective way, iterate quickly and ensure the system operates under all of these conditions.”</p>
<p>Simulation “gives our customers the power to validate their ADAS or autonomous systems virtually — with highly accurate sensors in the camera, lidar and radar domains — without having to rely on actual physical drives,” adds Tony Karam, global sales director at Ansys.</p>
<p>Austin Russell, founder and CEO of Luminar, agrees that &#8220;simulation is absolutely critical for autonomous driving. It’s great to see the work that NVIDIA has been doing in that domain, with not just the hardware but also the software.”</p>
<h2><b>NVIDIA Omniverse: The Digital-Physical Convergence</b></h2>
<p>“Software is a new component in the value proposition,” notes Walid Negm, chief technology officer of product engineering at Deloitte. The companies that will “survive and thrive are going to have to become much more efficient using the digital-physical convergence. The Omniverse experience is going to be important for the automotive sector.”</p>
<p>Shiv Tasker, global vice president of engineering at Capgemini, adds that the “visualization and production of digital twins relies on an efficient, high-performance infrastructure as well as the platforms that make it easy for customers to adopt the technology.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">Omniverse</a> “will allow your worldwide team to simultaneously collaborate,” says Karimi of Microsoft. “Design engineers, migration engineers, test engineers — everybody collaborates simultaneously. That’s the power of NVIDIA Omniverse.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Thanks to their work driving AI forward, Akshit Arora and Rafael Valle could someday speak to their spouses’ families in their native languages.</p>
<p>Arora and Valle — along with colleagues Sungwon Kim and Rohan Badlani — won the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/limmits24/home">LIMMITS ’24 challenge</a> which asks contestants to recreate in real time a speaker’s voice in English or any of six languages spoken in India with the appropriate accent. Their novel AI model only required a three-second speech sample.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA team advanced the state of the art in an emerging field of personalized voice interfaces for more than a billion native speakers of Bengali, Chhattisgarhi, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi and Telugu.</p>
<h2><b>Making Voice Interfaces Realistic</b></h2>
<p>The technology for personalized text-to-speech translation is a work in progress. Existing services sometimes fail to accurately reflect the accents of the target language or nuances of the speaker’s voice.</p>
<p>The challenge judged entries by listening for the naturalness of models’ resulting speech and its similarity to the original speaker’s voice.</p>
<p>The latest improvements promise personalized, realistic conversations and experiences that break language barriers. Broadcasters, telcos, universities, as well as e-commerce and online gaming services are eager to deploy such technology to create multilingual movies, lectures and virtual agents.</p>
<p>“We demonstrated we can do this at a scale not previously seen,” said Arora, who has two uses close to his heart.</p>
<h2><b>Breaking Down Linguistic Barriers</b></h2>
<p>A senior data scientist who supports one of NVIDIA’s biggest customers, Arora speaks Punjabi, while his wife and her family are native Tamil speakers.</p>
<p>It’s a gulf he’s long wanted to bridge for himself and others. “I had classmates who knew their native languages much better than the Hindi and English used in school, so they struggled to understand class material,” he said.</p>
<p>The gulf crosses continents for Valle, a native of Brazil whose wife and family speak Gujarati, a language popular in west India.</p>
<p>“It’s a problem I face every day,” said Valle, an AI researcher with degrees in computer music and machine listening and improvisation. “We’ve tried many products to help us have clearer conversations.”</p>
<p>Badlani, an AI researcher, said living in seven different Indian states, each with its own popular language, inspired him to work in the field.</p>
<h2><b>A Race to the Finish Line</b></h2>
<p>The initiative started nearly two years ago when Arora and Badlani formed the four-person team to work on the very different version of the challenge that would be held in 2023.</p>
<p>Their efforts generated a working code base for the so-called Indic languages. But getting to the win announced in January required a full-on sprint because the 2024 challenge didn’t get on the team’s radar until 15 days before the deadline.</p>
<p>Luckily, Kim, a deep learning researcher in NVIDIA’s Seoul office, had been working for some time on an AI model well suited to the challenge.</p>
<p>A specialist in text-to-speech voice synthesis, Kim was designing a so-called P-Flow model prior to starting his second internship at NVIDIA in 2023. P-Flow models borrow the technique large language models employ of using short voice samples as prompts so they can respond to new inputs without retraining.</p>
<p>“I created the model for English, but we were able to generalize it for any language,” he said.</p>
<p>“We were talking and texting about this model even before he started at NVIDIA,” said Valle, who mentored Kim in two internships before he joined full time in January.</p>
<h2><b>Giving Others a Voice</b></h2>
<p>P-Flow will soon be part of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/riva/">NVIDIA Riva</a>, a framework for building multilingual speech and translation AI software, included in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform.</p>
<p>The new capability will let users deploy the technology inside their data centers, on personal systems or in public or private cloud services. Today, voice translation services typically run on public cloud services.</p>
<p>“I hope our customers are inspired to try this technology,” Arora said. “I enjoy being able to showcase in challenges like this one the work we do every day.”</p>
<p>The contest is part of <a href="https://syspin.iisc.ac.in/">an initiative</a> to develop open-source datasets and AI models for nine languages most widely spoken in India.</p>
<p>Hear Arora and Badlani share their experiences in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/session-catalog/?tab.allsessions=1700692987788001F1cG&amp;search=S62517#/session/1696286805576001jEsz">a session</a> at GTC next month.</p>
<p>And listen to the results of the team’s model below, starting with a <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/SYSPIN/LIMMITS24_target_speaker_fewshot_samples">three-second sample</a> of a native Kannada speaker:</p>
