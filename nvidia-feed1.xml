										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>The home of the first industrial revolution just made a massive investment in the next one.</p>
<p>The U.K. government has announced it will spend £225 million ($273 million) to build one of the world’s fastest AI supercomputers.</p>
<p>Called Isambard-AI, it’s the latest in a series of systems named after a legendary 19th century British engineer and hosted by the University of Bristol. When fully installed next year, it will pack 5,448 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/">NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips</a> to deliver a whopping 21 exaflops of AI performance for researchers across the country and beyond.</p>
<p>The announcement was made at the AI Safety Summit, a gathering of over 100 global government and technology leaders, held in Bletchley Park, the site of the world’s first digital programmable computer, which reflected the work of innovators like Alan Turing, considered the father of AI.</p>
<p>AI “will bring a transformation as far-reaching as the industrial revolution, the coming of electricity or the birth of the internet,” said British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a speech last week about the event, designed to catalyze international collaboration.</p>
<h2><b>Propelling the Modern Economy</b></h2>
<p>Like one of Isambard Brunel’s creations — the first propeller-driven, ocean-going iron ship — the AI technology running on his namesake is already driving countries forward.</p>
<p>AI contributes more than £3.7 billion to the U.K. economy and employs more than 50,000 people, said Michelle Donelan, the nation’s Science, Innovation and Technology Secretary, in an earlier announcement about the system.</p>
<p>The investment in the so-called AI Research Resource in Bristol “will catalyze scientific discovery and keep the U.K. at the forefront of AI development,” she said.</p>
<p>Like AI itself, the system will be used across a wide range of organizations tapping the potential of machine learning to advance robotics, data analytics, drug discovery, climate research and more.</p>
<p>“Isambard-AI represents a huge leap forward for AI computational power in the U.K.,” said Simon McIntosh-Smith, a Bristol professor and director of the Isambard National Research Facility. “Today, Isambard-AI would rank within the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world and, when in operation later in 2024, it will be one of the most powerful AI systems for open science anywhere.”</p>
<h2><b>The Next Manufacturing Revolution</b></h2>
<p>Like the industrial revolution, AI promises advances in manufacturing. That’s one reason why Isambard-AI will be based at the National Composites Centre (NCC, pictured above) in the Bristol and Bath Science Park, one of the country’s seven manufacturing research centers.</p>
<p>The U.K.’s Frontier AI Taskforce, a research group leading a global effort on how frontier AI can be safely developed, will also be a major user of the system.</p>
<p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which is building Isambard-AI, is also collaborating with the University of Bristol on energy-efficiency plans that support net-zero carbon targets mandated by the British government.</p>
<h2><b>Energy-Efficient HPC</b></h2>
<p>A second system coming next year to the NCC will show Arm’s energy efficiency for non-accelerated high performance computing workloads.</p>
<p>Isambard-3 will deliver an estimated 2.7 petaflops of FP64 peak performance and consume less than 270 kilowatts of power, ranking it among the world’s three greenest non-accelerated supercomputers. That’s because the system — part of a research alliance among universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter — will sport 384 Arm-based <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-cpu-superchip/">NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchips</a> to power medical and scientific research.</p>
<p>“Isambard-3’s application performance efficiency of up to 6x its predecessor, which rivals many of the 50 fastest TOP500 systems, will provide scientists with a revolutionary new supercomputing platform to advance groundbreaking research,” said Bristol’s McIntosh-Smith, when the system was <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-grace-drives-wave-of-new-energy-efficient-arm-supercomputers">announced</a> in March.</p>

<p><span>In the latest episode of NVIDIA’s </span><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/ai-podcast/"><span>AI Podcast</span></a><span>, host Noah Kravitz spoke with Chockalingam about LLMs: what they are, their current state and their future potential.</span></p>
<p><span>Describing LLMs as a “subset of the larger generative AI movement,” Chockalingam says they can do five things with language: generate, summarize, translate, instruct or chat. With a combination of “these modalities and actions, you can build applications” to solve any problem, he said. </span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1651053912%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-5uJAR5koNPP&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span>Enterprises are tapping LLMs to drive innovation, develop new customer experiences and gain a competitive advantage, she said. They’re also exploring what safe deployment of those models looks like, aiming to achieve responsible development, trustworthiness and repeatability.</span></p>
<p><span>New techniques like retrieval augmented generation could boost LLM development. RAG involves feeding models with up-to-date data sources or third-party APIs to achieve “more appropriate responses,” Chockalingam said — granting them current context so that they can “generate better” answers.</span></p>
<p><span>Chockalingam encourages those interested in LLMs to “get your hands dirty and get started” — whether that means using popular applications like ChatGPT or playing with pretrained models in the </span><a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/?filters=&amp;orderBy=weightPopularDESC&amp;query="><span>NVIDIA NGC catalog</span></a><span>.</span><span>NVIDIA offers a full-stack computing platform for developers and enterprises experimenting with LLMs, with an ecosystem of over 4 million developers and 1,600 generative AI organizations. To learn more, register for </span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/llm-developer-day/#:~:text=LLM%20Developer%20Day%20%7C%20November%2017%2C%202023%20%7C%20NVIDIA"><span>LLM Developer Day</span></a><span> on Nov. 17 to hear from NVIDIA experts about how best to develop applications.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>In the world’s largest solar race car event of the year, the University of New South Wales Sunswift Racing team is having its day in the sun.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://worldsolarchallenge.org/">World Solar Challenge</a>, which first began some 35 years ago, attracts academic participants from across the globe. This year’s event drew nearly 100 competitors.</p>
<p>The race runs nearly 1,900 miles over the course of about four days and pits challengers in a battle not for speed but for greatest energy efficiency.</p>
<p>UNSW Sydney won the energy efficiency competition and crossed the finish line first, taking the Cruiser Cup with its Sunswift 7 vehicle, which utilizes <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/">NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX</a> for energy optimization. It was also the only competitor to race with 4 people on board and a remote mission control team.</p>
<p>“It’s a completely different proposition to say we can use the least amount of energy and arrive in Adelaide before anybody else, but crossing the line first is just about bragging rights,” said Richard Hopkins, project manager at Sunswift and a UNSW professor. Hopkins previously managed Formula 1 race teams in the U.K.</p>
<p>Race organizers bill the event, which cuts across the entire Australian continent on public roads — from Darwin in the north to Adelaide in the south — as the “world’s greatest innovation and engineering challenge contributing to a more sustainable mobility future.” It’s also become a launchpad for students pursuing career paths in the electric vehicle industry.</p>
<p>Like many of the competitors, UNSW is coming back after a three-year hiatus from the race due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making this year’s competition highly anticipated.</p>
<p>“Every single team member needs to understand what they’re doing and what their role is on the team and perform at the very best during those five-and-a-half days,” said Hopkins. “It is exhausting.”</p>
<h2><b>All In on Energy Efficiency  </b></h2>
<p>The race allows participants to start with a fully charged battery and to charge when the vehicles stop for the night at two locations. The remaining energy used, some 90%, comes from the sun and the vehicles’ solar panels.</p>
<p>UNSW’s seventh-generation Sunswift 7 runs algorithms to optimize for energy efficiency, essentially shutting down all nonessential computing to maximize battery life.</p>
<p>The solar electric vehicle relies on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a> AI to give it an edge across its roughly 100 automotive monitoring and power management systems.</p>
<p>It can also factor in whether it should drive faster or slower based on weather forecasts. For instance, the car will urge the driver to go faster if it’s going to rain later in the day when conditions would force the car to slow down.</p>
<p>The Sunswift 7 vehicle was designed to mostly drive in a straight line from Darwin to Adelaide, and the object is to use the least amount of power outside of that mission, said Hopkins.</p>
<p>“Sunswift 7 late last year was featured in the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> for being the fastest electric vehicle for over 1,000 kilometers on a single charge of battery,” he said.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sunswift 7 (Ep 04 - Guinness World Record attempt ) - Fastest EV over 1000k on a single charge." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jm1Efr8vlk4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Jetson-Based Racers for Learning</b></h2>
<p>The UNSW team created nearly 60 design iterations to improve on the aerodynamics of the vehicle. They used computational fluid dynamics modeling and ran simulations to analyze each version.</p>
<p>“We didn’t ever put the car through a physical wind tunnel,” said Hopkins.</p>
<p>The technical team has been working on a model to determine what speed the vehicle should be driven at for maximum energy conservation. “They’re working on taking in as many parameters as you can, given it’s really hard to get good driving data,” said Josh Bramley, technology manager at Sunswift Racing.</p>
<p>Sunswift 7 is running on the Robot Operating System (ROS) suite of software and relies on its NVIDIA Jetson module to process all the input from the sensors for analytics, which can be monitored by the remote pit crew back on campus at UNSW.</p>
<p>Jetson is used for all the control systems on the car, so everything from the accelerator pedal, wheel sensors, solar current sensors and more are processed on it for data to analyze for ways AI might help, said Bramley. The next version of the vehicle is expected to pack more AI, he added.</p>
<p>“A lot of the AI and computer vision will be coming for Sunswift 8 in the next solar challenge,” said Bramley.</p>
<p>More than 100 students are getting course credit for the Sunswift Racing team work, and many are interested in pursuing careers in electric vehicles, said Hopkins.</p>
<p>Past World Solar Challenge contestants have gone on to work at Tesla, SpaceX and Zipline.</p>

<p>The latest Halloween-themed Studio Standouts video features ghouls, creepy monsters, haunted hospitals, dimly lit homes and is not for the faint-of-heart.</p>
<h2><b>Remarkable Ray Reconstruction</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS 3.5</a> — featuring Ray Reconstruction — enhances ray-traced image quality on GeForce RTX GPUs by replacing hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 | New Ray Reconstruction Enhances Ray Tracing with AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGKCrcNsVzo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Previewing content in the viewport, even with high-end hardware, can sometimes offer less than ideal image quality, as traditional denoisers require hand-tuning for every scene.</p>
<p>With DLSS 3.5, the AI neural network recognizes a wide variety of scenes, producing high-quality preview images and drastically reducing time spent rendering scenes.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Omniverse and the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/usd-composer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USD Composer</a> app — featuring the Omniverse RTX Renderer — specialize in real-time preview modes, offering ray-tracing inference and higher-quality previews while building and iterating.</p>
<p>The feature can be enabled by opening “Render Settings” under “Ray Tracing,” opening the “Direct Lighting” tab and ensuring “New Denoiser (experimental)” is turned on.</p>

<p>Then he carefully positions his projectors — building protective casings to keep them both safe and blended into the scene.</p>

<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>“In the last few years, I’ve rendered 32,862 frames of 5K animation out of the Octane Render Engine. The loop has now become 21 minutes long, and the musical show is another 28 minutes!” — Sabour Amirazodi</p>
</div>
<p>Building a virtual scene onto a physical object requires projection mapping, so Amirazodi used NVIDIA GPU-accelerated MadMapper software and its structured light-scan feature to map custom visuals onto his house. He achieved this by connecting a DSLR camera to his mobile workstation, which was powered by an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a5000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPU</a>.</p>
<p>He used the camera to shoot a series of lines and capture photos. Then, he translated to the projector’s point of view an image on which to base a 3D model. Basic camera-matching tools found in Cinema 4D helped recreate the scene. Afterward, Amirazodi applied various mapping and perspective correction edits.</p>

<p>Next, Amirazodi animated and rigged the characters. GPU acceleration in the viewport enabled smooth interactivity with complex 3D models.</p>
<p>“I like having a choice between several third-party NVIDIA GPU-accelerated 3D renderers, such as V-Ray, OctaneRender and Redshift in Cinema 4D,” noted Amirazodi.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>“I switched to NVIDIA graphics cards in 2017. GPUs are the only way to go for serious creators.” — Sabour Amirazodi</p>
</div>
<p>Amirazodi then spent hours on his <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a6000/">RTX 6000</a> workstation creating and rendering out all the animations, assembling them in Adobe After Effects and compositing them on the scanned canvas in MadMapper. There, he crafted individual scenes to render out as chunks and assembled them in Adobe Premiere Pro. Remarkably, he repeated this workflow for every projector.</p>
<p>Once satisfied with the sequences, Amirazodi encoded everything using Adobe Media Encoder and loaded them onto BrightSign digital players — all networked to run the show synchronously.</p>
<p>Amirazodi used the advantages of GPU acceleration to streamline his workflow — saving him countless hours. “After Effects has numerous plug-ins that are GPU-accelerated — plus, Adobe Premiere Pro and Media Encoder use the new dual encoders found in the Ada generation of NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs, cutting my export times in half,” he said.</p>

<p>Amirazodi’s careful efforts are all in the Halloween spirit — creating a hauntingly memorable experience for his community.</p>
<p>“The hard work and long nights all become worth it when I see the smile on my kids’ faces and all the joy it brings to the entire neighborhood,” he reflected.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>A <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2023-10_chipnemo-domain-adapted-llms-chip-design">research paper</a> released today describes ways <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> can assist one of the most complex engineering efforts: designing semiconductors.</p>
<p>The work demonstrates how companies in highly specialized fields can train large language models (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/">LLMs</a>) on their internal data to build assistants that increase productivity.</p>
<p>Few pursuits are as challenging as semiconductor design. Under a microscope, a state-of-the-art chip like an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU</a> (above) looks like a well-planned metropolis, built with tens of billions of transistors, connected on streets 10,000x thinner than a human hair.</p>
<p>Multiple engineering teams coordinate for as long as two years to construct one of these digital megacities.</p>
<p>Some groups define the chip’s overall architecture, some craft and place a variety of ultra-small circuits, and others test their work. Each job requires specialized methods, software programs and computer languages.</p>
<h2><b>A Broad Vision for LLMs</b></h2>
<p>“I believe over time large language models will help all the processes, across the board,” said Mark Ren, an NVIDIA Research director and lead author on the paper.</p>
<p>Bill Dally, NVIDIA’s chief scientist, announced the paper today in a keynote at the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, an annual gathering of hundreds of engineers working in the field called electronic design automation, or EDA.</p>
<p>“This effort marks an important first step in applying LLMs to the complex work of designing semiconductors,” said Dally at the event in San Francisco. “It shows how even highly specialized fields can use their internal data to train useful generative AI models.”</p>
<h2><b>ChipNeMo Surfaces</b></h2>
<p>The paper details how NVIDIA engineers created for their internal use a custom LLM, called ChipNeMo, trained on the company’s internal data to generate and optimize software and assist human designers.</p>
<p>Long term, engineers hope to apply generative AI to each stage of chip design, potentially reaping significant gains in overall productivity, said Ren, whose career spans more than 20 years in EDA.</p>
<p>After surveying NVIDIA engineers for possible use cases, the research team chose three to start: a chatbot, a code generator and an analysis tool.</p>
<h2><b>Initial Use Cases</b></h2>
<p>The latter — a tool that automates the time-consuming tasks of maintaining updated descriptions of known bugs — has been the most well-received so far.</p>
<p>A prototype chatbot that responds to questions about GPU architecture and design helped many engineers quickly find technical documents in early tests.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67780" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67780" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNemo.gif"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-67780 size-full" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNemo.gif" alt="Animation of a generative AI code generator using an LLM" width="600" height="338" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67780" class="wp-caption-text">A code generator will help designers write software for a chip design.</figcaption></figure>
<p>A code generator in development (demonstrated above)  already creates snippets of about 10-20 lines of software in two specialized languages chip designers use. It will be integrated with existing tools, so engineers have a handy assistant for designs in progress.</p>
<h2><b>Customizing AI Models With NVIDIA NeMo</b></h2>
<p>The paper mainly focuses on the team’s work gathering its design data and using it to create a specialized generative AI model, a process portable to any industry.</p>
<p>As its starting point, the team chose a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/03/13/what-are-foundation-models/">foundation model</a> and customized it with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, a framework for building, customizing and deploying generative AI models that’s included in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform. The selected NeMo model sports 43 billion parameters, a measure of its capability to understand patterns. It was trained using more than a trillion tokens, the words and symbols in text and software.</p>
<figure id="attachment_67773" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67773" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-67773" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final-672x338.jpg" alt="Diagram of the ChipNeMo workflow for training a custom model" width="672" height="338" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final-672x338.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final-400x201.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final-768x386.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final-842x423.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final-406x204.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final-188x95.jpg 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ChipNeMo-diagram-Final.jpg 1277w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67773" class="wp-caption-text">ChipNeMo provides an example of how one deeply technical team refined a pretrained model with its own data.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The team then refined the model in two training rounds, the first using about 24 billion tokens worth of its internal design data and the second on a mix of about 130,000 conversation and design examples.</p>
<p>The work is among several examples of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10204.pdf">research</a> and <a href="https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/explore/large-language-models-llms.html">proofs of concept</a> of generative AI in the semiconductor industry, just beginning to emerge from the lab.</p>
<h2><b>Sharing Lessons Learned</b></h2>
<p>One of the most important lessons Ren’s team learned is the value of customizing an LLM.</p>
<p>On chip-design tasks, custom ChipNeMo models with as few as 13 billion parameters match or exceed performance of even much larger general-purpose LLMs like LLaMA2 with 70 billion parameters. In some use cases, ChipNeMo models were dramatically better.</p>
<p>Along the way, users need to exercise care in what data they collect and how they clean it for use in training, he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Researchers are taking deep learning for a deep dive, literally.</p>
<p>The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) Autonomous Robotics and Perception Laboratory (<a href="https://warp.whoi.edu/">WARPLab</a>) and MIT are developing a robot for studying coral reefs and their ecosystems.</p>
<p>The WARPLab autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), enabled by an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/">NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX</a> module, is an effort from the world’s largest private ocean research institution to turn the tide on reef declines.</p>
<p>Some 25% of coral reefs worldwide have vanished in the past three decades, and most of the remaining reefs are heading for extinction, according to the <a href="https://reefsolutions.whoi.edu/">WHOI Reef Solutions Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>The AUV, dubbed CUREE (Curious Underwater Robot for Ecosystem Exploration), gathers visual, audio, and other environmental data alongside divers to help understand the human impact on reefs and the sea life around them. The robot runs an expanding collection of NVIDIA Jetson-enabled edge AI to build 3D models of reefs and to track creatures and plant life. It also runs models to navigate and collect data autonomously.</p>
<p>WHOI, whose submarine first explored the Titanic in 1986, is developing its CUREE robot for data gathering to scale the effort and aid in mitigation strategies. The oceanic research organization is also exploring the use of simulation and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/12/14/what-is-a-digital-twin/">digital twins</a> to better replicate reef conditions and investigate solutions like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a development platform for building and connecting 3D tools and applications.</p>
<p>Creating a digital twin of Earth in Omniverse, NVIDIA is developing the world’s most powerful AI supercomputer for predicting climate change, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/11/12/earth-2-supercomputer/">called Earth-2</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Underwater AI: DeepSeeColor Model</b></h2>
<p>Anyone who’s gone snorkeling knows that seeing underwater isn’t as clear as seeing on land. Over distance, water attenuates the visible spectrum of light from the sun underwater, muting some colors more than others. At the same time, particles in the water create a hazy view, known as backscatter.</p>
<p>A team from WARPLab recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04025.pdf">published a research paper</a> on undersea vision correction that helps mitigate these problems and supports the work of CUREE. The paper describes a model, called DeepSeeColor, that uses a sequence of two <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/09/05/whats-the-difference-between-a-cnn-and-an-rnn/">convolutional neural networks</a> to reduce backscatter and correct colors in real time on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX while undersea.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA GPUs are involved in a large portion of our pipeline because, basically, when the images come in, we use DeepSeeColor to color correct them, and then we can do the fish detection and transmit that to a scientist up at the surface on a boat,” said Stewart Jamieson, a robotics Ph.D. candidate at MIT and AI developer at WARPLab.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DeepSeeColor: Removing backscatter and color attenuation from underwater images in realtime" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vpge92KRU1M?start=1&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Eyes and Ears: Fish and Reef Detection</b></h2>
<p>CUREE packs four forward-facing cameras, four hydrophones for underwater audio capture, depth sensors and inertial measurement unit sensors. GPS doesn’t work underwater, so it is only used to initialize the robot’s starting position while on the surface.</p>
<p>Using a combination of cameras and hydrophones along with AI models running on the Jetson Orin NX enables CUREE to collect data for producing 3D models of reefs and undersea terrains.</p>
<p>To use the hydrophones for audio data collection, CUREE needs to drift with its motor off so that there’s no interference with the audio.</p>
<p>“It can build a spatial soundscape map of the reef, using sounds produced by different animals,” said Yogesh Girdhar, an associate scientist at WHOI, who leads WARPLab. “We currently (in post-processing) detect where all the chatter associated with bioactivity hotspots is,” he added, referring to all the noises of sea life.</p>
<p>The team has been training detection models for both audio and video input to track creatures. But a big noise interference with detecting clear audio samples has come from one creature in particular.</p>
<p>“The problem is that, underwater, the snapping shrimps are loud,” said Girdhar. On land, this classic dilemma of how to separate sounds from background noises is known as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/08/28/music-youtube-cocktail-party-problem-ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-learning/">the cocktail party problem</a>. “If only we could figure out an algorithm to remove the effects of sounds of snapping shrimps from audio, but at the moment we don’t have a good solution,” said Girdhar.</p>
<p>Despite few underwater datasets in existence, <a href="https://warp.whoi.edu/vmat/">pioneering fish detection and tracking</a> is going well, said Levi Cai, a Ph.D. candidate in the MIT-WHOI joint program. He said they’re taking a semi-supervised approach to the marine animal tracking problem. The tracking is initialized using targets detected by a <a href="https://github.com/warplab/megafishdetector">fish detection neural network</a> trained on open-source datasets for fish detection, which is fine-tuned with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/02/07/what-is-transfer-learning/">transfer learning</a> from images gathered by CUREE.</p>
<p>“We manually drive the vehicle until we see an animal that we want to track, and then we click on it and have the semi-supervised tracker take over from there,” said Cai.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tracking a barracuda using CUREE" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s_PBaYIqNKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Jetson Orin Energy Efficiency Drives CUREE</b></h2>
<p>Energy efficiency is critical for small AUVs like CUREE. The compute requirements for data collection consume roughly 25% of the available energy resources, with driving the robots taking the remainder.</p>
<p>CUREE typically operates for as long as two hours on a charge, depending on the reef mission and the observation requirements, said Girdhar, who goes on the dive missions in St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>To enhance energy efficiency, the team is looking into AI for managing the sensors so that computing resources automatically stay awake while making observations and sleep when not in use.</p>
<p>“Our robot is small, so the amount of energy spent on GPU computing actually matters — with Jetson Orin NX our power issues are gone, and it’s made our system much more robust,” said  Girdhar.</p>
<h2><b>Exploring Isaac Sim to Make Improvements </b></h2>
<p>The WARPLab team is experimenting with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim">NVIDIA Isaac Sim</a>, a scalable robotics simulation application and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/06/08/what-is-synthetic-data/">synthetic data</a> generation tool powered by Omniverse, to accelerate development of autonomy and observation for CUREE.</p>
<p>The goal is to do simple simulations in Isaac Sim to get the core essence of the problem to be simulated and then finish the training in the real world undersea, said Yogesh.</p>
<p>“In a coral reef environment, we cannot depend on sonars — we need to get up really close,” he said. “Our goal is to observe different ecosystems and processes happening.”</p>
<h2><b>Understanding Ecosystems and Creating Mitigation Strategies</b></h2>
<p>The WARPLab team intends to make the CUREE platform available for others to understand the impact humans are having on undersea environments and to help create mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>The researchers plan to learn from patterns that emerge from the data. CUREE provides an almost fully autonomous data collection scientist that can communicate findings to human researchers, said Jamieson. “A scientist gets way more out of this than if the task had to be done manually, driving it around staring at a screen all day,” he said.</p>
<p>Girdhar said that ecosystems like coral reefs can be modeled with a network, with different nodes corresponding to different types of species and habitat types. Within that, he said, there are all these different interactions happening, and the researchers seek to understand this network to learn about the relationship between various animals and their habitats.</p>
<p>The hope is that there’s enough data collected using CUREE AUVs to gain a comprehensive understanding of ecosystems and how they might progress over time and be affected by harbors, pesticide runoff, carbon emissions and dive tourism, he said.</p>
<p>“We can then better design and deploy interventions and determine, for example, if we planted new corals how they would change the reef over time,” said Girdar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>NVIDIA researchers are collaborating with academic centers worldwide to advance <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">generative AI</a>, robotics and the natural sciences — and more than a dozen of these projects will be shared at <a href="https://neurips.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeurIPS</a>, one of the world’s top AI conferences.</p>
<p>Set for Dec. 10-16 in New Orleans, NeurIPS brings together experts in generative AI, machine learning, computer vision and more. Among the innovations <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/">NVIDIA Research</a> will present are new techniques for transforming text to images, photos to 3D avatars, and specialized robots into multi-talented machines.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA Research continues to drive progress across the field — including generative AI models that transform text to images or speech, autonomous AI agents that learn new tasks faster, and neural networks that calculate complex physics,” said Jan Kautz, vice president of learning and perception research at NVIDIA. “These projects, often done in collaboration with leading minds in academia, will help accelerate developers of virtual worlds, simulations and autonomous machines.”</p>
<h2><b>Picture This: Improving Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</b></h2>
<p>Diffusion models have become the most popular type of generative AI models to turn text into realistic imagery. NVIDIA researchers have collaborated with universities on multiple projects advancing diffusion models that will be presented at NeurIPS.</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 300;">
<li>A paper accepted as an oral presentation focuses on improving generative AI models’ ability to <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/oral/73870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">understand the link between modifier words and main entities</a> in text prompts. While existing text-to-image models asked to depict a yellow tomato and a red lemon may incorrectly generate images of yellow lemons and red tomatoes, the new model analyzes the syntax of a user’s prompt, encouraging a bond between an entity and its modifiers to deliver a more faithful visual depiction of the prompt.</li>
<li>SceneScape, a new framework using <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/71859" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diffusion models to create long videos of 3D scenes from text prompts</a>, will be presented as a poster. The project combines a text-to-image model with a depth prediction model that helps the videos maintain plausible-looking scenes with consistency between the frames — generating videos of art museums, haunted houses and ice castles (pictured above).</li>
<li>Another poster describes work that improves how text-to-image models <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/70922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate concepts rarely seen in training data</a>. Attempts to generate such images usually result in low-quality visuals that aren’t an exact match to the user’s prompt. The new method uses a small set of example images that help the model identify good seeds — random number sequences that guide the AI to generate images from the specified rare classes.</li>
<li>A third poster shows how a text-to-image diffusion model can <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/70648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use the text description of an incomplete point cloud</a> to generate missing parts and create a complete 3D model of the object. This could help complete point cloud data collected by lidar scanners and other depth sensors for robotics and autonomous vehicle AI applications. Collected imagery is often incomplete because objects are scanned from a specific angle — for example, a lidar sensor mounted to a vehicle would only scan one side of each building as the car drives down a street.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67733" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-672x222.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="222" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-672x222.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-400x132.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-768x253.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-1536x506.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-842x278.jpg 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-406x134.jpg 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-188x62.jpg 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion-1280x422.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Point-Cloud-Completion.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Character Development: Advancements in AI Avatars</b></h2>
<p>AI avatars combine multiple generative AI models to create and animate virtual characters, produce text and convert it to speech. Two NVIDIA posters at NeurIPS present new ways to make these tasks more efficient.</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 300;">
<li>A poster describes a new method to <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/72615" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn a single portrait image into a 3D head avatar</a> while capturing details including hairstyles and accessories. Unlike current methods that require multiple images and a time-consuming optimization process, this model achieves high-fidelity 3D reconstruction without additional optimization during inference. The avatars can be animated either with blendshapes, which are 3D mesh representations used to represent different facial expressions, or with a reference video clip where a person’s facial expressions and motion are applied to the avatar.</li>
<li>Another poster by NVIDIA researchers and university collaborators advances zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis with P-Flow, a generative AI model that can <a href="https://pflow-demo.github.io/projects/pflow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapidly synthesize high-quality personalized speech</a> given a three-second reference prompt. P-Flow features better pronunciation, human likeness and speaker similarity compared to recent state-of-the-art counterparts. The model can near-instantly convert text to speech on a single <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Research Breakthroughs in Reinforcement Learning, Robotics</b></h2>
<p>In the fields of reinforcement learning and robotics, NVIDIA researchers will present two posters highlighting innovations that improve the generalizability of AI across different tasks and environments.</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 300;">
<li>The first proposes a <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/72040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">framework for developing reinforcement learning algorithms</a> that can adapt to new tasks while avoiding the common pitfalls of gradient bias and data inefficiency. The researchers showed that their method — which features a novel meta-algorithm that can create a robust version of <i>any</i> meta-reinforcement learning model — performed well on multiple benchmark tasks.</li>
<li>Another by an NVIDIA researcher and university collaborators tackles the challenge of <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/71709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">object manipulation in robotics</a>. Prior AI models that help robotic hands pick up and interact with objects can handle specific shapes but struggle with objects unseen in the training data. The researchers introduce a new framework that estimates how objects across different categories are geometrically alike — such as drawers and pot lids that have similar handles — enabling the model to more quickly generalize to new shapes.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Supercharging Science: AI-Accelerated Physics, Climate, Healthcare</b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA researchers at NeurIPS will also present papers across the natural sciences — covering physics simulations, climate models and AI for healthcare.</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 300;">
<li>To accelerate <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/72670" target="_blank" rel="noopener">computational fluid dynamics for large-scale 3D simulations</a>, a team of NVIDIA researchers proposed a neural operator architecture that combines accuracy and computational efficiency to estimate the pressure field around vehicles — the first deep learning-based computational fluid dynamics method on an industry-standard, large-scale automotive benchmark. The method achieved 100,000x acceleration on a single <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/">NVIDIA Tensor Core GPU</a> compared to another GPU-based solver, while reducing the error rate. Researchers can incorporate the model into their own applications using the open-source <a href="https://github.com/neuraloperator/neuraloperator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neuraloperator library</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67740" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1-672x390.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="390" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1-672x390.jpg 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1-400x232.jpg 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1-768x446.jpg 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1-775x450.jpg 775w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1-370x215.jpg 370w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1-172x100.jpg 172w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-1.jpg 1171w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A consortium of climate scientists and machine learning researchers from universities, national labs, research institutes, Allen AI and NVIDIA collaborated on <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/73569" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClimSim</a>, a massive dataset for physics and machine learning-based climate research that will be shared in an oral presentation at NeurIPS. The dataset covers the globe over multiple years at high resolution — and machine learning emulators built using that data can be plugged into existing operational climate simulators to improve their fidelity, accuracy and precision. This can help scientists produce better predictions of storms and other extreme events.</li>
<li>NVIDIA Research interns are presenting a poster introducing an AI algorithm that provides personalized <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/71940" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predictions of the effects of medicine dosage</a> on patients. Using real-world data, the researchers tested the model’s predictions of blood coagulation for patients given different dosages of a treatment. They also analyzed the new algorithm’s predictions of the antibiotic vancomycin levels in patients who received the medication — and found that prediction accuracy significantly improved compared to prior methods.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Visual effects artist Surfaced Studio returns to 'In the NVIDIA Studio' to share his real-world VFX project, created on a brand new Razer Blade 16 Mercury Edition laptop powered by GeForce RTX 4080 graphics. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Visual effects artist Surfaced Studio returns to <i>In the NVIDIA Studio</i> to share his real-world VFX project, created on a brand new <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-16/RZ09-0483TEM3-R3U1">Razer Blade 16 Mercury Edition</a> laptop powered by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4080/">GeForce RTX 4080</a> graphics.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Razer Blade 16 Mercury Edition - Real World VFX Test &amp; Review" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d6AR3XnwtIs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Surfaced Studio creates photorealistic, digitally generated imagery that seamlessly integrates visual effects into short films, television and console gaming.</p>
<p>He found inspiration for a recent sci-fi project by experimenting with 3D transitions: using a laptop screen as a gateway between worlds, like the portals from <i>Dr. Strange</i> or the transitions from <i>The Matrix</i>.</p>
<h2><b>Break the Rules and Become a Hero</b></h2>
<p>Surfaced Studio aimed to create an immersive experience with his latest project.</p>
<p>“I wanted to get my audience to feel surprised getting ‘sucked into’ the 3D world,” he explained.</p>
<p>Surfaced Studio began with a simple script, alongside sketches of brainstormed ideas and played out shots. “This usually helps me think through how I’d pull each effect off and whether they’re actually possible,” he said.</p>
<p>From there, he shot video and imported the footage into Adobe Premiere Pro for a rough test edit. Then, Surfaced Studio selected the most suitable clips for use.</p>
<p>He cleaned up the footage in Adobe After Effects, stabilizing shots with the Warp Stabilizer tool and removing distracting background elements with the Mocha Pro tool. Both effects were accelerated by his GeForce RTX 4080 Laptop GPU.</p>
<p>After, he created a high-contrast version of the shot for 3D motion tracking in Blender.</p>

<p>Motion tracking is used to apply tracking data to 3D objects. “This was pretty tricky, as it’s a 16-second gimbal shot with fast moving sections and a decent camera blur,” said Surfaced Studio. “It took me a good few days to get a decent track and fix issues with manual keyframes and ‘patches’ between different sections.”</p>

<p>Surfaced Studio exported footage of the animated camera into a 3D FBX file to use in Unreal Engine and set it up in the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/high-city-sp#">Cyberpunk High City pack</a>, which contains a modular constructor for creating highly detailed sci-fi city streets, alleys and blocks.</p>

<p>“I’m not much of a 3D artist so using [the Cyberpunk High City pack] was the best option to complete the project on this side of the century,” the artist said. He then made modifications to the cityscape, reducing flickering lights and adding buildings, custom fog and Razer and NVIDIA Studio banners. He even added a billboard with an ad encouraging kindness to cats. “It’s so off to the side of most shots I doubt anyone actually noticed,” noted a satisfied Surfaced Studio.</p>

<p>Learning 3D effects can seem overwhelming due to the vast knowledge needed across multiple apps and district workflows. But Surfaced Studio stresses the simple importance of first understanding workflow hierarchies — and how one feeds into another — as an approachable entry point to choosing a specialty suited to a creator’s unique passion and natural talent.</p>
<p>Surfaced Studio was able to seamlessly run his scene in Unreal Engine full 4K resolution — with all textures and materials loading at maximum graphical fidelity — thanks to the GeForce RTX 4080 Laptop GPU in his Razer Blade 16. The graphics card also contains <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-3-5-available-september-21/#:~:text=DLSS%203.5%20is%20available%20for,NVIDIA%20DLSS%203.5%20announcement%20article.">NVIDIA DLSS</a> capabilities to increase viewport interactivity by using AI to upscale frames rendered at lower resolution while retaining high-fidelity detail.</p>

<p>Surfaced Studio then took the FBX file with the exported camera tracking data into Unreal Engine, matching his ‘3D camera’ with the real-world one used to film the laptop with. “This was the crucial step in creating the ‘look-through’ effect I wanted,” he said.</p>
<p>Once satisfied with the look, Surfaced Studio exported all sequences from Unreal Engine as multilayer EXR files — including a Z-depth pass, a grayscale value range to create a depth-of-field effect — to separate visual elements from the 3D footage.</p>

<p>With GeForce RTX 4080 dual encoders, Surface Studio nearly halved Adobe Premiere Pro video decoding and encoding export times. Surfaced Studio has been using NVIDIA GPUs for over a decade, citing their widespread integration with commonly used tools.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA has simply done a better job than its competitors to reach out to and integrate with other companies that create creative apps,” said Surfaced Studio. “CUDA and RTX are widespread technologies that you find in most popular creative apps to accelerate workflows.”</p>
<p>When he’s not working on VFX projects, Surfaced Studio also uses his laptop to game. The Razer Blade 16 has the first dual-mode mini-LED display with two native resolutions: UHD+ at 120Hz — suited for VFX workflows — and FHD at 240Hz — ideal for gamers (or creators who like gaming).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Images such as those in Google Street View are taking on a new purpose in the hands of University of Florida Assistant Professor of Artificial Intelligence Chaofeng Wang.</p>
<p>He’s using them, along with deep learning, in a research project to automate the evaluation of urban buildings. The project aims to help governments mitigate natural disaster damage by providing the information needed for decision-makers to bolster building structures or perform post-disaster recovery.</p>
<p>After a natural disaster such as an earthquake, local governments send teams to check and evaluate building conditions. Manually done, it can take up to months to go through the full stock of a city.</p>
<p>Wang’s project uses AI to accelerate the evaluation process — cutting the time needed to a few hours. The AI model is trained using images sourced from Google Street View and local governments to assign scores to buildings based on <a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/earthquake/training/fema-p-154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) P-154 standards</a>, which provide assessment guidelines based on factors like wall material, structure type, building age and more. Wang also collaborated with the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disasterriskmanagement/brief/global-program-for-resilient-housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Bank Global Program for Resilient Housing</a> to collect images and perform annotations, which were used to improve the model.</p>
<p>The collected images are placed in a data repository. The AI model reads the repository and performs inference on the images — a process accelerated by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-a100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DGX A100</a> systems.</p>
<p>“Without NVIDIA GPUs, we wouldn’t have been able to do this,” Wang said. “They significantly accelerate the process, ensuring timely results.”</p>
<p>Wang used the DGX A100 nodes in the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/07/21/university-of-florida-nvidia-ai-supercomputer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Florida’s supercomputer, HiPerGator</a>. HiPerGator is one of the world’s fastest AI supercomputers in academia, delivering 700 petaflops of AI performance, and was built with the support of NVIDIA founder and UF alumnus Chris Malachowsky and hardware, software, training and services from NVIDIA.</p>
<p>The AI model’s output is compiled into a database that feeds into a web portal, which shows information — including the safety assessment score, building type and even roof or wall material — in a map-based format.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-67651" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/streetviewscreenshot.png" alt="" width="1757" height="787" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/streetviewscreenshot.png 1757w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/streetviewscreenshot-400x179.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/streetviewscreenshot-672x301.png 672w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/streetviewscreenshot-768x344.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/streetviewscreenshot-1536x688.png 1536w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/streetviewscreenshot-842x377.png 842w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/streetviewscreenshot-406x182.png 406w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/streetviewscreenshot-188x84.png 188w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/streetviewscreenshot-1280x573.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1757px) 100vw, 1757px" /></p>
<p>Wang’s work was funded by the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/higher-education-research/applied-research-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Applied Research Accelerator Program</a>, which supports research projects that have the potential to make a real-world impact through the deployment of NVIDIA-accelerated applications adopted by commercial and government organizations.</p>
<h2><strong>A Helping Eye</strong></h2>
<p>Wang says that the portal can serve different needs depending on the use case. To prepare for a natural disaster, a government can use predictions solely from street view images.</p>
<p>“Those are static images — one example is Google Street View images, which get updated every several years,” he said. “But that’s good enough for collecting information and getting a general understanding about certain statistics.”</p>
<p>But for rural areas or developing regions, where such images aren’t available or not frequently updated, governments can collect the images themselves. Powered by NVIDIA GPUs, the timely delivery of building assessments can help accelerate analyses.</p>
<p>Wang also suggests that with enough refinement, his research could also create ripples for the urban planning and insurance industries.</p>
<p>The project is currently being tested by a few local governments in Mexico and is garnering interest in some African, Asian and South American countries. At its current state, it can achieve over 85% accuracy in its assessment scores, per ‌FEMA P-154 standards.</p>
<h2><b>Survey of the Land</b></h2>
<p>One challenge Wang cites is the variation in urban landscapes in different countries. Different regions have their own cultural and architectural styles. Not trained on a large or diverse enough pool of images, the AI model could be thrown off by factors like paint color when performing wall material analysis. Another challenge is urban density variation.</p>
<p>“It is a very general limitation of current AI technology,” Wang said. “In order to be useful, it requires enough training data to represent the distribution of the real world, so we’re putting efforts into the data collection process to solve the generalization issue.”</p>
<p>To overcome this challenge, Wang aims to train and test the model for more cities. So far, he’s tested about eight cities in different countries.</p>
<p>“We need to generate more detailed and high-quality annotations to train the model with,” he said. “That is the way we can improve the model in the future so that it can be used more widely.”</p>
<p>Wang’s goal is to get the project to a point where it can be deployed as a service for more general industry use.</p>
<p>“We are creating application programming interfaces that can estimate and analyze buildings and households to allow seamless integration with other products,” he said. “We are also building a user-friendly application that all government agencies and organizations can use.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>GPU-powered surgical-simulation devices are helping train more than 2,000 doctors a year in lower-income countries to treat cataract blindness, the world’s <a href="https://academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/14/Supplement_1/i68/6563812" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading cause of blindness</a>, thanks to the nonprofit HelpMeSee.</p>
<p>While cataract surgery has a success rate of <a href="https://okko.com.au/what-is-the-cataract-surgery-success-rate/#:~:text=The%20success%20rate%20for%20cataract,Sloan%2C%20F.%2C%202021." target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 99%</a>, many patients in low- and middle-income countries lack access to the common procedure due to a severe shortage of ophthalmologists. An estimated 90% of the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/14/Supplement_1/i68/6563812" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 million people</a> affected by cataract-related visual impairment or blindness are in these locations.</p>
<p>By training more healthcare providers — including those without a specialty in ophthalmology — to treat cataracts, <a href="https://helpmesee.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HelpMeSee</a> improves the quality of life for patients such as a mother of two young children in Bhiwandi, near Mumbai, India, who was blinded by cataracts in both eyes.</p>
<p>“After the surgery, her vision improved dramatically and she was able to take up a job, changing the course of her entire family,” said Dr. Chetan Ahiwalay, chief instructor and subject-matter expert for HelpMeSee in India. “She and her husband are now happily raising their kids and leading a healthy life. These are the things that keep us going as doctors.”</p>
<p>HelpMeSee’s simulator devices use <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx/">NVIDIA RTX GPUs</a> to render high-quality visuals, providing a more realistic training environment for doctors to hone their surgical skills. To further improve the trainee experience, NVIDIA experts are working with the HelpMeSee team to improve rendering performance, increase visual realism and augment the simulator with next-generation technologies such as real-time ray tracing and AI.</p>
<h2><b>Tackling Treatable Blindness With Accessible Training</b></h2>
<p>High-income countries have <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-14491-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18x more ophthalmologists</a> per million residents than low-income countries. That coverage gap, which is far wider still in certain countries, makes it harder for those in thinly resourced areas to receive treatment for avoidable blindness.</p>
<p>HelpMeSee’s devices can train doctors on multiple eye procedures using immersive tools inspired by flight simulators used in aviation. The team trains doctors in countries including India, China, Madagascar, Mexico and the U.S., and rolls out multilingual training each year for new procedures.</p>
<p>The eye surgery simulator offers realistic 3D visuals, haptic feedback, performance scores and the opportunity to attempt a step of the procedure multiple times until the trainee achieves proficiency. Qualified instructors like Dr. Ahiwalay travel to rural and urban areas to deliver the training through structured courses — and help surgeons transition from the simulators to live surgeries.</p>

<p>“We’re lowering the barrier for healthcare practitioners to learn these specific skills that can have a profound impact on patients,” said Dr. Bonnie An Henderson, CEO of HelpMeSee, which is based in New York. “Simulation-based training will improve surgical skills while keeping patients safe.”</p>
<h2><b>Looking Ahead to AI, Advanced Rendering </b></h2>
<p>HelpMeSee works with <a href="https://surgicalscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Surgical Science</a>, a supplier of medical virtual-reality simulators, based in Gothenburg, Sweden, to develop the 3D models and real-time rendering for its devices. Other collaborators — Strasbourg, France-based <a href="https://www.insimo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InSimo</a> and Pune, India-based <a href="https://services.harman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harman Connected Services</a> — develop the physics-based simulations and user interface, respectively.  <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/delivering_the_nucleus.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-67492" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/delivering_the_nucleus-400x400.png" alt="" width="250" height="250" srcset="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/delivering_the_nucleus-400x400.png 400w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/delivering_the_nucleus-500x500.png 500w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/delivering_the_nucleus-150x150.png 150w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/delivering_the_nucleus-768x768.png 768w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/delivering_the_nucleus-450x450.png 450w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/delivering_the_nucleus-215x215.png 215w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/delivering_the_nucleus-100x100.png 100w, https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/delivering_the_nucleus.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a></p>
<p>“Since there are many crucial visual cues during eye surgery, the simulation requires high fidelity,” said Sebastian Ullrich, senior manager of software development at Surgical Science, who has worked with HelpMeSee for years. “To render a realistic 3D representation of the human eye, we use custom shader materials with high-resolution textures to represent various anatomical components, mimic optical properties such as refraction, use order-independent transparency sorting and employ volume rendering.”</p>
<p>NVIDIA RTX GPUs support 3D volume rendering, stereoscopic rendering and depth sorting algorithms that provide a realistic visual experience for HelpMeSee’s trainees. Working with NVIDIA, the team is investigating AI models that could provide trainees with a real-time analysis of the practice procedure and offer recommendations for improvement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>A new AI agent developed by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Research</a> that can teach robots complex skills has trained a robotic hand to perform rapid pen-spinning tricks — for the first time as well as a human can.</p>
<p>The stunning prestidigitation, showcased in the video above, is one of nearly 30 tasks that robots have learned to expertly accomplish thanks to Eureka, which autonomously writes reward algorithms to train bots.</p>
<p>Eureka has also taught robots to open drawers and cabinets, toss and catch balls, and manipulate scissors, among other tasks.</p>
<p>The Eureka research, <a href="https://eureka-research.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published today</a>, includes a paper and the project’s AI algorithms, which developers can experiment with using <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Isaac Gym</a>, a physics simulation reference application for <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/08/02/supervised-unsupervised-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reinforcement learning</a> research. Isaac Gym is built on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a development platform for building 3D tools and applications based on the OpenUSD framework. Eureka itself is powered by the GPT-4 <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/01/26/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language model</a>.</p>
<p>“Reinforcement learning has enabled impressive wins over the last decade, yet many challenges still exist, such as reward design, which remains a trial-and-error process,” said Anima Anandkumar, senior director of AI research at NVIDIA and an author of the Eureka paper. “Eureka is a first step toward developing new algorithms that integrate generative and reinforcement learning methods to solve hard tasks.”</p>

<h2><b>AI Trains Robots</b></h2>
<p>Eureka-generated reward programs — which enable trial-and-error learning for robots — outperform expert human-written ones on more than 80% of tasks, according to the paper. This leads to an average performance improvement of more than 50% for the bots.</p>

<p>The AI agent taps the GPT-4 LLM and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> to write software code that rewards robots for reinforcement learning. It doesn’t require task-specific prompting or predefined reward templates — and readily incorporates human feedback to modify its rewards for results more accurately aligned with a developer’s vision.</p>
<p>Using GPU-accelerated simulation in Isaac Gym, Eureka can quickly evaluate the quality of large batches of reward candidates for more efficient training.</p>
<p>Eureka then constructs a summary of the key stats from the training results and instructs the LLM to improve its generation of reward functions. In this way, the AI is self-improving. It’s taught all kinds of robots — quadruped, bipedal, quadrotor, dexterous hands, cobot arms and others — to accomplish all kinds of tasks.</p>
<p>The research paper provides in-depth evaluations of 20 Eureka-trained tasks, based on open-source dexterity benchmarks that require robotic hands to demonstrate a wide range of complex manipulation skills.</p>
<p>The results from nine Isaac Gym environments are showcased in visualizations generated using NVIDIA Omniverse.</p>

<p><i>Humanoid robot learns a running gait via Eureka.</i></p>
<p>“Eureka is a unique combination of large language models and NVIDIA GPU-accelerated simulation technologies,” said Linxi “Jim” Fan, senior research scientist at NVIDIA, who’s one of the project’s contributors. “We believe that Eureka will enable dexterous robot control and provide a new way to produce physically realistic animations for artists.”</p>
<p>It’s breakthrough work bound to get developers’ minds spinning with possibilities, adding to recent NVIDIA Research advancements like <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/10/04/ai-jim-fan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voyager</a>, an AI agent built with GPT-4 that can autonomously play <i>Minecraft</i>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>To enable professionals worldwide to build and run AI applications right from their desktops, NVIDIA and AMD are powering a new line of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/workstations/latest/">workstations</a> equipped with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX Ada Generation GPUs</a> and <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1162/amd-introduces-new-amd-ryzen-threadripper-7000-series" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7000 WX-Series CPUs</a>.</p>
<p>Bringing together the highest levels of AI computing, rendering and simulation capabilities, these new platforms enable professionals to efficiently tackle the most resource-intensive, large-scale AI workflows locally.</p>
<h2><b>Bringing AI Innovation to the Desktop</b></h2>
<p>Advanced AI tasks typically require data-center-level performance. Training a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large language model</a> with a trillion parameters, for example, takes thousands of GPUs running for weeks, though research is underway to reduce model size and enable model training on smaller systems while still maintaining high levels of AI model accuracy.</p>
<p>The new NVIDIA RTX GPU and AMD CPU-powered AI workstations provide the power and performance required for training such smaller models, as well as local fine-tuning, and helping to offload data center and cloud resources for AI development tasks. The devices let users select single- or multi-GPU configurations as required for their workloads.</p>
<p>Smaller trained AI models also provide the opportunity to use workstations for local inferencing. RTX GPU and AMD CPU-powered workstations can be configured to run these smaller AI models for inference serving for small workgroups or departments.</p>
<p>With up to 48GB of memory in a single NVIDIA RTX GPU, these workstations offer a cost-effective way to reduce compute load on data centers. And when professionals do need to scale training and deployment from these workstations to data centers or the cloud, the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform enables seamless portability of workflows and toolchains.</p>
<p>RTX GPU and AMD CPU-powered workstations also enable cutting-edge visual workflows. With accelerated computing power, the new workstations enable highly interactive content creation, industrial digitalization, and advanced simulation and design.</p>
<h2><b>Unmatched Power, Performance and Flexibility</b></h2>
<p>AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7000 WX-Series processors provide the CPU platform for the next generation of demanding workloads. The processors deliver a significant increase in core count — up to 96 cores per CPU — and industry-leading maximum memory bandwidth in a single socket.</p>
<p>Combining them with the latest NVIDIA RTX Ada Generation GPUs brings unmatched power and performance in a workstation. The GPUs enable up to 2x the performance in ray tracing, AI processing, graphics rendering and computational tasks compared to the previous generation.</p>
<p>Ada Generation GPUs options include the RTX 4000 SFF, RTX 4000, RTX 4500, RTX 5000 and RTX 6000. They’re built on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/ada-lovelace-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture</a> and feature up to 142 third-generation RT Cores, 568 fourth-generation Tensor Cores and 18,176 latest-generation CUDA cores.</p>
<p>From architecture and manufacturing to media and entertainment and healthcare, professionals across industries will be able to use the new workstations to tackle challenging AI computing workloads — along with 3D rendering, product visualization, simulation and scientific computing tasks.</p>
<h2><b>Availability</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/workstations/latest/">New workstations</a> powered by NVIDIA RTX Ada Generation GPUs and the latest AMD Threadripper Pro processors will be available starting next month from BOXX and HP, with other system integrators offering them soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Powerful generative AI models and cloud-native APIs and microservices are coming to the edge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/generative-ai/">Generative AI</a> is bringing the power of transformer models and large language models to virtually every industry. That reach now includes areas that touch edge, robotics and logistics systems: defect detection, real-time asset tracking, autonomous planning and navigation, human-robot interactions and more.</p>
<p>NVIDIA today announced major expansions to two frameworks on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson platform</a> for edge AI and robotics: the NVIDIA <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-ros">Isaac ROS</a> robotics framework has entered general availability, and the NVIDIA Metropolis expansion on Jetson is coming next.</p>
<p>To accelerate AI application development and deployments at the edge, NVIDIA has also created a <a href="https://www.jetson-ai-lab.com">Jetson Generative AI Lab</a> for developers to use with the latest open-source generative AI models.</p>
<p>More than 1.2 million developers and over 10,000 customers have chosen NVIDIA AI and the Jetson platform, including Amazon Web Services, Cisco, John Deere, Medtronic, Pepsico and Siemens.</p>
<p>With the rapidly evolving AI landscape addressing increasingly complicated scenarios, developers are being challenged by longer development cycles to build AI applications for the edge. Reprogramming robots and AI systems on the fly to meet changing environments, manufacturing lines and automation needs of customers is time-consuming and requires expert skills.</p>
<p>Generative AI offers zero-shot learning — the ability for a model to recognize things specifically unseen before in training — with a natural language interface to simplify the development, deployment and management of AI at the edge.</p>
<h2><b>Transforming the AI Landscape</b></h2>
<p>Generative AI dramatically improves ease of use by understanding human language prompts to make model changes. Those AI models are more flexible in detecting, segmenting, tracking, searching and even reprogramming — and  help outperform traditional <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/09/05/whats-the-difference-between-a-cnn-and-an-rnn/">convolutional neural network</a>-based models.</p>
<p>Generative AI is expected to add $10.5 billion in revenue for manufacturing operations worldwide by 2033, according to ABI Research.</p>
<p>“Generative AI will significantly accelerate deployments of AI at the edge with better generalization, ease of use and higher accuracy than previously possible,” said Deepu Talla, vice president of embedded and edge computing at NVIDIA. “This largest-ever software expansion of our Metropolis and Isaac frameworks on Jetson, combined with the power of transformer models and generative AI, addresses this need.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Generative AI Models at the Edge Powered by NVIDIA Jetson Orin" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BAMOw7qlVXw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><b>Developing With Generative AI at the Edge</b></p>
<p>The Jetson Generative AI Lab provides developers access to optimized tools and tutorials for deploying open-source LLMs, diffusion models to generate stunning interactive images, vision language models (VLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) that combine vision AI and natural language processing to provide comprehensive understanding of the scene.</p>
<p>Developers can also use the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tao-toolkit">NVIDIA TAO Toolkit</a> to create efficient and accurate AI models for edge applications. TAO provides a low-code interface to fine-tune and optimize vision AI models, including ViT and vision foundational models. They can also customize and fine-tune foundational models like NVIDIA NV-DINOv2 or public models like OpenCLIP to create highly accurate vision AI models with very little data. TAO additionally now includes VisualChangeNet, a new transformer-based model for defect inspection.</p>
<h2><b>Harnessing New Metropolis and Isaac Frameworks</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/metropolis">NVIDIA Metropolis</a> makes it easier and more cost-effective for enterprises to embrace world-class, vision AI-enabled solutions to improve critical operational efficiency and safety problems. The platform brings a collection of powerful application programming interfaces and microservices for developers to quickly develop complex vision-based applications.</p>

<p>With the general availability of the latest <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-ros">Isaac ROS 2.0</a> release, developers can now create and bring high-performance robotics solutions to market with Jetson.</p>
<p>“ROS continues to grow and evolve to provide open-source software for the whole robotics community,” said Geoff Biggs, CTO of the Open Source Robotics Foundation. “NVIDIA’s new prebuilt ROS 2 packages, launched with this release, will accelerate that growth by making ROS 2 readily available to the vast NVIDIA Jetson developer community.”</p>
<h2><b>Delivering New Reference AI Workflows</b></h2>
<p>Developing a production-ready AI solution entails optimizing the development and training of AI models tailored to specific use cases, implementing robust security features on the platform, orchestrating the application, managing fleets, establishing seamless edge-to-cloud communication and more.</p>
<p>NVIDIA announced a curated collection of AI reference workflows based on Metropolis and Isaac frameworks that enable developers to quickly adopt the entire workflow or selectively integrate individual components, resulting in substantial reductions in both development time and cost. The three distinct AI workflows include: Network Video Recording, Automatic Optical Inspection and Autonomous Mobile Robot.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA Jetson, with its broad and diverse user base and partner ecosystem, has helped drive a revolution in robotics and AI at the edge,” said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. “As application requirements become increasingly complex, we need a foundational shift to platforms that simplify and accelerate the creation of edge deployments. This significant software expansion by NVIDIA gives developers access to new multi-sensor models and generative AI capabilities.”</p>
<h2><b>More Coming on the Horizon </b></h2>
<p>NVIDIA announced a collection of system services which are fundamental capabilities that every developer requires when building edge AI solutions. These services will simplify integration into workflows and spare developer the arduous task of building them from the ground up.</p>
<p>The new NVIDIA JetPack 6, expected to be available by year’s end, will empower AI developers to stay at the cutting edge of computing without the need for a full Jetson Linux upgrade, substantially expediting development timelines and liberating them from Jetson Linux dependencies. JetPack 6 will also use the collaborative efforts with Linux distribution partners to expand the horizon of Linux-based distribution choices, including Canonical’s Optimized and Certified Ubuntu, Wind River Linux, Concurrent Real-Time Redhawk Linux and various Yocto-based distributions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Artificial intelligence is now a household term. Responsible AI is hot on its heels.</p>
<p>Julia Stoyanovich, associate professor of computer science and engineering at NYU and director of the university’s <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/centers/center-responsible-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Responsible AI</a>, wants to make the terms “AI” and “responsible AI” synonymous.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of the NVIDIA <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/ai-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Podcast</a>, host Noah Kravitz ‌spoke with Stoyanovich about responsible AI, her advocacy efforts and how people can help.</p>
<p>Stoyanovich started her work at the Center for Responsible AI with basic research. She soon realized that what was needed were better guardrails, not just more algorithms.</p>
<p>As AI’s potential has grown, along with the ethical concerns surrounding its use, Stoyanovich clarifies that the “responsibility” lies with people, not AI.</p>
<p>“The responsibility refers to people taking responsibility for the decisions that we make individually and collectively about whether to build an AI system and how to build, test, deploy and keep it in check,” she said.</p>
<p>AI ethics is a related concern, used to refer to “the embedding of moral values and principles into the design, development and use of the AI,” she added.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have taken notice. For example, New York recently implemented a law that makes job candidate screening more transparent.</p>
<p>According to Stoyanovich, “the law is not perfect,” but “we can only learn how to regulate something if we try regulating” and converse openly with the “people at the table being impacted.”</p>
<p>Stoyanovich wants two things: for people to recognize that AI can’t predict human choices and that AI systems be transparent and accountable, carrying a “nutritional label.”</p>
<p>That process should include considerations on who is using AI tools, how they’re used to make decisions and who is subjected to those decisions, she said.</p>
<p>Stoyanovich urges people to “start demanding actions and explanations to understand” how AI is used at local, state and federal levels.</p>
<p>“We need to teach ourselves to help others learn about what AI is and why we should care,” she said. “So please get involved in how we govern ourselves, because we live in a democracy. We have to step up.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Real-time rendering, animation and texture baking are essential workflows for 3D art production. Using the Marmoset Toolbag software, 3D artists can enhance their creative workflows and build complex 3D models without disruptions to productivity. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p><i>Editor’s note: This post is part of </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Into the Omniverse</i></a><i>, a series focused on how artists and developers from startups to enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advances in </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>OpenUSD</i></a><i> and </i><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>NVIDIA Omniverse</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<p>Real-time rendering, animation and texture baking are essential workflows for 3D art production. Using the Marmoset Toolbag software, 3D artists can enhance their creative workflows and build complex 3D models without disruptions to productivity.</p>
<p>The latest release of Marmoset Toolbag, version 4.06, brings increased support for <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Universal Scene Description</a>, aka OpenUSD, enabling seamless compatibility with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>, a development platform for connecting and building OpenUSD-based tools and applications.</p>
<p>3D creators and technical artists using Marmoset can now enjoy improved interoperability, accelerated rendering, real-time visualization and efficient performance —  redefining the possibilities of their creative workflows.</p>
<h2><b>Enhancing Cross-Platform Creativity With OpenUSD</b></h2>
<p>Creators are taking their workflows to the next level with OpenUSD.</p>
<p>Berlin-based Armin Halač works as a principal animator at <a href="https://www.wooga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wooga</a>, a mobile games development studio known for projects like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.wooga.junes_journey_hidden_object_mystery_game&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>June’s Journey</i></a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.GhostDetective&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Ghost Detective</i></a>. The nature of his job means Halač is no stranger to 3D workflows — he gets hands-on with animation and character rigging.</p>
<p>For texturing and producing high-quality renders, Marmoset is Halač’s go-to tool, providing a user-friendly interface and powerful features to simplify his workflow. Recently, Halač used Marmoset to create the captivating cover image for his book, <a href="https://www.routledge.com/A-Complete-Guide-to-Character-Rigging-for-Games-Using-Blender/Halac/p/book/9781032203003" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>A Complete Guide to Character Rigging for Games Using Blender</i></a><i>.</i></p>

<p>Nkoro Anselem Ire, a.k.a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@askNK/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">askNK</a>, is a popular YouTube creator as well as a media and visual arts professor at a couple of universities who is also seeing workflow benefits from increased USD support.</p>
<p>As a 3D content creator, he uses Marmoset Toolbag for the majority of his <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d/discover/pbr.html#:~:text=Physically%20based%20rendering%20(PBR)%2C,light%20interacts%20with%20material%20properties." target="_blank" rel="noopener">PBR</a> workflow — from texture baking and lighting to animation and rendering. Now, with USD, askNK is enjoying newfound levels of creative flexibility as the framework allows him to “collaborate with individuals or team members a lot easier because they can now pick up and drop off processes while working on the same file.”</p>

<p>Additionally, 3D artists <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/04/19/studio-omniverse-usd-composer-animation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gianluca Squillace and Pasquale Scionti</a> are harnessing the collaborative power of Omniverse, Marmoset and OpenUSD to transform their workflows from a convoluted series of exports and imports to a streamlined, real-time, interconnected process.</p>
<p>Squillace crafted a captivating 3D character with Pixologic ZBrush, Autodesk Maya, Adobe Substance 3D Painter and Marmoset Toolbag — aggregating the data from the various tools in Omniverse. With USD, he seamlessly integrated his animations and made real-time adjustments without the need for constant file exports.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Scionti constructed a stunning glacial environment using Autodesk 3ds Max, Adobe Substance 3D Painter, Quixel and Unreal Engine, uniting the various pieces from his tools in Omniverse. His work showcased the potential of Omniverse to foster real-time collaboration as he was able to seamlessly integrate Squillace’s character into his snowy world.</p>
